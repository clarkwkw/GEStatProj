    "text": "The magic of Scribblenauts remains as it always has been  the ability to conjure objects to solve whimsical puzzles and problems by simply writing down the answer. Tap &quot;kitten&quot; into your notepad and a bundle of fur will appear, solving your lack of a romantic present for a date. Spell out &quot;water hose&quot; and a length of emergency piping will leap into existence to put that finishing touch to the fire engine you&apos;re building. This being the fourth Scribblenauts to appear on 3DS and the first on Wii U, the game&apos;s magical writing pad here now incorporates both adjectives (&quot;a cute kitten&quot;) and a more sophisticated vocabulary than ever before, giving significant depth to its magician&apos;s-hat mechanics. What&apos;s new this time, however, is an interest in backstory and themed, explorable levels, which together give shape to the otherwise unguided process of second-guessing. But this remains window dressing to the game&apos;s creative possibilities. It&apos;s never better than when a far-fetched lateral thought results in an unconventional victory, which happens in Unlimited more than ever. Conversely, finding yourself repeatedly out of synch with the game&apos;s sense of logic can destroy the illusion of blank-canvas invention. The result: Scribblenauts Unlimited is often brilliant, frequently ingenious, and just occasionally, a chore.",

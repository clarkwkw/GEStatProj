    "headline": "A history of Nokia's from paper mills to Gorbachev", 
    "text": "In 1865, Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill in south-west Finland and started manufacturing paper. He opened a second mill three years later near the town of Nokia and by 1902, the firm had moved into electricity generating. Shortly after the first world war, Nokia was close to bankruptcy and the nearby Finnish Rubber Works, maker of galoshes, hoses and tyres, bought the firm in order to ensure a power supply. A few years later, the group acquired Finnish Cable Works, exporter of telephone and electricity cables to the Soviet Union, and the crucible of Nokia&apos;s electronics business. The three companies merged in 1922 to form a conglomerate. By the 1960s, Nokia had begun making radio phones for the Finnish military. In 1982, Nokia introduced its first car phone, with the grand title of Mobira Senator. Its first handheld mobile arrived in 1987 and weighed a hefty 0.7kg (1.7lbs). Officially called the Mobira Cityman, it soon became known as the &apos;Gorba&apos; after Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev was pictured using one. By 1992, conglomerates were out of fashion and Nokia decided to focus entirely on mobile phones, gradually selling off its rubber, cable and consumer electronics businesses.",

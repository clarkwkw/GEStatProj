    "text": "Individuals, businesses and foundations have continued to give money to humanitarian and development organisations despite harsh economic times, providing a crucial source of funding in the face of declining official aid. The resilience of private funding is highlighted in a report by Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA), an aid funding watchdog. According to the report, 24% of the international humanitarian response from 2006 to 2010 came from private voluntary contributions  at least $18bn. In 2010 alone, $5.8bn was donated privately, mainly in response to the earthquake in Haiti and the floods in Pakistan. As a share of the total humanitarian response, private funding grew from 17% in 2006 to 32% in 2010. &quot;Private funding has remained consistent despite a severe global economic crisis, so, at a time when government resources are limited and maintaining response to the growing number of aid challenges is particularly demanding, private money has become the answer for many organisations,&quot; said Velina Stoianova, policy adviser at GHA and author of the report. &quot;It is therefore imperative that we are able to gain as clear a picture as possible about the effectiveness of this funding source in responding to humanitarian needs and tackling vulnerability.&quot;",

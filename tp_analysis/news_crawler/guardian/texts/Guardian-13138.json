    "headline": "How we compile the postgraduate tables", 
    "text": "The tables provide subject-level summaries of the taught postgraduate programmes on offer at each institution in the UK. Eight pieces of information are provided for prospectivestudents. Some of these commonly have value judgments associated with them (completion rates, for instance) but others are simply for reference (fees, proportion of overseas students). University departments are not provided with an overall teaching score, so we haven&apos;t ranked universities by subjects and there is no overall institutional table. Statistical measures Volume of provision This shows the number of full-time and part-time students taking a course, and illustrates the size of the department and the mode of study options it provides. Distance learners are included in the part-time figure. All numbers are headcounts of taughtpostgraduatesfrom the 2010-11 academic year, the latest for which data is available. Students from outside UK This measure shows the proportion of postgraduates studying in 2010-11 who have their permanent home outside of the UK. The statistic includes both EU and non-EU students but excludes foreign students who resided in the UK before commencing their studies. Part-time and full-time students are both included in the figures, but it should be remembered that very few students from outside the EU study part time. Expenditure per student This is calculated by taking the amount of money that an institution spends providing a course (not including the cost of academic staff, since this is already counted in the student-staff ratio) and dividing this by the volume of students learning the subject. All students are included in this calculation, not just postgraduates. Added to this figure is the amount of money the institution has spent on academic services over the last two years, including library and computing facilities, divided by the volume of students enrolled at the university in each of those two years. At least 25 (full-time equivalent) students must be counted in the calculation for it to be accepted and year-on-year inconsistency or extreme values can also cause results to be considered non-credible. Points are assigned to the expenditure-per-student values according to how that value compares with the average for the subject, given the standard deviation of average expenditures in that subject. Student-staff ratios Student-staff ratios (SSRs) compare the number of staff teaching a subject with the number of students studying it, to get a ratio where a low SSR is regarded positively. At least 25 students and two staff (both full-time equivalent) must be present in an SSR calculation. Year-on-year inconsistency and extreme values at either end of the spectrum cause several SSRs to be considered non-credible. Full-time student completion rate This statistic refers to the population of full-time postgraduate students (not including those aiming for institutional postgraduate credits or &quot;no formal postgraduate qualification&quot;) who either completed their qualification in 2010-11 or who were in the standard registration population and had a leaving date within that year. This will include students who completed after writing up their dissertation in 2010-11 having received the taught element of their course in the previous year. Such students, as well as students who fail to complete after a period of dormancy, are counted in the calculation of completion rates but not in the full-time and part-time &quot;volume of provision&quot; fields. Once the population is defined, a comparison between qualification aim and any qualification awarded determines the leaving status of the student. Students who are awarded the qualification they sought are treated positively along with students who were awarded a similar or superior qualification to the one they were aiming for. Students leaving with a lesser award or no qualification at all are treated negatively. Part-time student completion rate This statistic is identical to the full-time (FT) completion rate but for part-time (PT) students only. The greater flexibility of part-time modes of study often results in lower or slower completion rates, so combining FT and PT rates would be likely to unfairly penalise departments that predominantly offer part-time courses. Tuition fees for home and overseas students Unless highlighted, the tuition fees shown here will apply to students starting courses in 2013-14. Those that are highlighted are showing the rates charged in 2012-13 and should only be used as an estimate of what the course would cost to starters in 2013-14. The fees generally refer to full-time master&apos;s courses and you can expect to pay less for part-time courses and postgraduate diplomas or certificates. Information was supplied by the institutions that responded to our fee survey and we did not seek to include bursaries and discounts that many students will be eligible for  please refer to institution websites for such details and to verify that the fee information depicted here is still current. Thresholds for inclusion An institution must meet three criteria to be included in a subject table:  First, at least 25 postgraduate students (headcount of FT and PT) must have been assigned to the subject. The process for students being assigned to subjects uses a mapping of JACS codes, which institutions have the opportunity to tailor to reflect their own boundaries of provision.  Second, the cost centre that has been assigned to the institution&apos;s department must contain at least 25 FTE students. Again, universities and colleges can control which cost centre is used.  Third, the department must have at least a full-time or part-time completion rate.

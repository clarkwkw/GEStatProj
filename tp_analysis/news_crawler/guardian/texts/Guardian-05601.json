    "text": "Like most children, the year 5 pupils at Cheddar Grove primary used to believe the adverts on the telly. Not any more. &quot;Do you know that with some models they plaster about 10 layers of make-up on, and then they make their hair all wavy with a fan, and they can even change how they look with the computer so they&apos;re slimmer?&quot; says Carys. &quot;They don&apos;t really look like that at all!&quot; &quot;About 99% of adverts you see have been Photoshopped,&quot; adds her classmate Harry. &quot;You just can&apos;t trust a thing they tell you,&quot; says his friend Franklin. &quot;When I see an advert now, I often just laugh and think  yeah, not very likely.&quot; For nine- and 10-year-olds, this is remarkably sophisticated media analysis  and pretty welcome, given that the average child watches as many as 40,000 adverts a year. These children&apos;s eyes were opened to the tricks of the trade by a pair of ex-teachers who are on a mission to improve children&apos;s body image  and they believe that to do that, you have to start young. Nicky Hutchinson and Chris Calland  previously a primary and a secondary school teacher respectively  are education consultants in Bristol. They specialise in children&apos;s behaviour, but devised their primary school body-image course, which has just been piloted at Cheddar Grove in the city, after getting requests from heads and teachers for advice on how to deal with the increasing anxiety pupils were displaying about how they looked. &quot;Parents were calling schools to say their children were stressing about what to wear on non-uniform days, or for friends&apos; birthday parties, or for the school disco,&quot; says Hutchinson. &quot;The more we looked into it, the more we discovered what a problem it was. By the age of 10, around a third of all girls, and 22% of boys, say how their bodies look is their number one worry. And 10 is also the average age when children start dieting.&quot; &quot;So much is affected by how you feel about your body  your ability to enjoy life, form good relationships and make the most of opportunities,&quot; says Calland. &quot;But all the indicators are that the current population of young people have lower body confidence than ever before  and that&apos;s borne out by the rising numbers of youngsters with eating disorders and serious anxieties about their appearance.&quot; It&apos;s certainly not a problem limited to girls. &quot;Boys worry about it far more than in the past,&quot; she says. &quot;Traditionally girls have always shown greater concern about their weight and appearance, but the research shows boys are also worrying. They want to be tall and, when they&apos;re a bit older, to be muscular  and they worry about weight too.&quot; At present, most interventions to counter negative body image are concentrated on secondary schools, where some children already have eating disorders  but Hutchinson and Calland believe the lessons should start much earlier, towards the top of primary school. &quot;Research shows that this is the age when children are at risk of developing a poor body image,&quot; says Hutchinson. &quot;We believe that by helping to improve their self-esteem at this stage, and making them more aware of the messages the media is putting out, we&apos;ll be able to equip them better to be confident about how they look.&quot; The course Calland and Hutchinson run encourages children to think about what makes them unique, and to question the way the media distorts body images. It&apos;s clear, talking to year 5 at Cheddar Grove, that the lessons struck a chord. &quot;We talked about two boys who each had a very different body image  one was happy with the way he looked, the other was unhappy,&quot; says Harry. &quot;After we&apos;d discussed their feelings, we turned the cards over to see what the two boys looked like  and realised they were the same boy!&quot; &quot;The whole idea,&quot; says Calland, &quot;is to get them to realise that body image is quite separate from how a person looks. Anyone, however they look, can have a positive or a negative body image  and that&apos;s an important thing to realise  it helps you look more deeply at what it&apos;s all about.&quot; As they researched their course, Calland and Hutchinson realised they&apos;d stumbled on what was, for many teachers, a topic to avoid at all costs. &quot;Many teachers admitted they were fearful because there are always going to be children in any class who have issues: maybe they&apos;re overweight, maybe they&apos;re already very concerned with their appearance, maybe they have a disfigurement or disability,&quot; she says. &quot;We understand that concern, but we say, these are already issues for these children. It&apos;s much better to bring them out into the open and explore them than just leave them to fester. &quot;Children may already be being bullied or teased, and by emphasising children&apos;s inner qualities, they are likely to be helped by realising that it&apos;s who they are inside that counts. Talking about our individual skills and talents, which is another strong element of the course, means children who are already suffering from a poor body image will be helped by getting compliments from their peers for their unsung qualities  and they&apos;ll also realise they&apos;re not alone, and that others have anxieties as well.&quot; Healthy eating and anti-obesity messages, though necessary, says Calland, sometimes have a negative effect. &quot;Some children have absorbed the anti-obesity message to such an extent that they dread gaining weight. We&apos;ve spoken to parents who say their children have become obsessive after learning about obesity as an issue in school  and the research shows that even young children identify being fat with being unintelligent, lazy and smelly  something, in other words, to avoid at any price. So we&apos;re giving children part of the picture, but we&apos;re not giving them the whole picture: we&apos;re neglecting the wider landscape and that&apos;s really not fair to the children.&quot; Hutchinson and Calland&apos;s course at Cheddar Grove, and another Bristol primary school, is currently being evaluated by Dr Emma Halliwell, senior psychology lecturer at the University of the West of England. &quot;We know that simply giving pupils information about eating disorders, usually in secondary school, isn&apos;t helpful,&quot; she says. &quot;We&apos;ve got to tackle these problems in new ways, and I&apos;m looking at whether this course can equip children with the skills they need in the long term.&quot; Pupils who have been on the course have been questioned about its impact, and will be questioned again before the end of the school year; Halliwell will report her findings in July. Parents, meanwhile, have been overwhelmingly positive about the classes, according to Cheddar Grove year 5 teacher Lisa Cullin. &quot;We had a parents&apos; evening a few weeks after the course ended, and lots of the parents said it had prompted discussions at home,&quot; she says. &quot;Year 5 is a perfect age to start dealing with these issues because they&apos;re just starting to get more body aware, and the hormones are just starting to kick in. &quot;The teaching is quite subtle and age-appropriate, but the children were really shocked by some of what they learned  especially about the advertising industry, and how much manipulation goes on. They still talk about that a lot.&quot;  For more information on the body image course, see  Body Image in the Primary School, which has resources for teachers, is published by Routledge, price 19.99",

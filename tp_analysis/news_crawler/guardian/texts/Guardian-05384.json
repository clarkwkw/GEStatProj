    "text": "The Department for Trade and Industry says corporate social responsibility (CSR) &quot;is about the integrity with which a company governs itself, fulfils its mission, lives by its values, engages with its stakeholders and measures its impacts and publicly reports on its activities.&quot; But does the same apply in higher education? In a research paper Mehran Nejati et al, question to what extent universities behave like large corporations and demonstrate responsibility for stakeholders and society as a whole. The authors identify seven strands that make up CSR (including organisational governance, student issues, community involvement and the environment) and conclude that developing strategies around all of these can help universities create an understanding of their role in their communities and help them manage potential conflict. While CSR is in part about building positive relationships, business consultant Richard Goossen also suggests that CSR can help an institution develop a competitive advantage and stand out from its competitors. He says: &quot;Universities realise that it is a competitive market in terms of creating an ongoing stream of satisfied alumni, attracting new students and addressing the concerns of business supporters, a strategy which incorporates CSR is a start.&quot; So how should universities be satisfying they diverse stakeholders?

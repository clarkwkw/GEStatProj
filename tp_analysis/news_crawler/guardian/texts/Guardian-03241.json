    "text": "Chris Huhne, the former energy secretary, has intervened to attack &quot;posturing top Tories&quot; after it emerged a group of senior ministers are staging a last-minute effort to block the green deal, one of his key legacies. Some senior Conservative ministers confirmed on Sunday that they were arguing that the rising cost of living and the recession made it necessary to look again at the green deal, a scheme designed to help millions of households become more energy-efficient by offering them financial incentives to insulate their homes and reduce emissions. The ministers, including the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, and the employment minister, Chris Grayling, are concerned that the green deal will force some households to spend thousands of pounds making their homes more energy-efficient at a time when their other bills were rising. The green deal, due to be launched in October, is designed to provide state-backed cheap finance to cover the upfront costs of improvements such as loft insulation or cavity wall insulation. But some Conservative ministers are furious at plans to require households to spend money on energy efficiency if they need to repair a boiler, replace windows or undertake major extensions. The deal was included in the 2011 Energy Act and is seen as central to the government goal of cutting carbon emissions and meeting the promise to be the greenest government ever. Backtracking on the deal now would expose the government to criticisms that it has abandoned this pledge. Huhne condemned those trying to undo his work: &quot;The green deal means that home insulation is funded from the savings in home energy bills so people are better off, not worse off. Top Tories should stop posturing on green plans that help hard-hit households. &quot;The green deal became law last year with all-party support because it is a world-leading way for households to save energy and costs.&quot; The Liberal Democrat MP resigned as energy secretary in February after the Crown Prosecution Service charged him with asking his then wife, Vicky Pryce, to take penalty points for a speeding offence committed nearly a decade ago. He faces trial in October. The Conservative energy minister, Greg Barker, also criticised the sniping, describing the attacks as &quot;bonkers&quot; and pointing out that the green deal policy was in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition agreement and had been developed by the Conservatives in opposition. Aides of Huhne&apos;s successor as energy secretary, Ed Davey, were also angry at the attack, saying the average cost of the green deal to householders would be 500 and that would be recovered quickly in lower energy bills. A senior Tory source was quoted in the Sunday Telegraph saying: &quot;The green deal was Chris Huhne&apos;s baby. He has gone now and it is the right time to kill it off. Forcing people to pay thousands of pounds for unwanted extra home insulation is the last thing hard-pressed families need at the moment. It&apos;s madness.&quot; The Guardian has separately established that some ministers are opposed not just to any suggestion of a requirement to make a home more energy-efficient, but to the whole green deal itself. One minister said: &quot;It cannot be right that every time your boiler blows up, you have to face the cost of replacing it, but also buying loft insulation. It is piling too much on. &quot;We need to pause with the green deal and look at it again in the light of the recession.&quot; Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, mounted a strong public defence of the green economy last week in a major speech. He promised: &quot;We&apos;ll ensure customers are never charged more for the home improvements than we expect them to make back in cheaper bills. Plus the charge is attached to the property, rather than the person, so if you move, you stop paying. That is maximum affordability, with savings that should more than cover costs.&quot; The requirement to make a home more energy efficient whenever a homeowner wants to replace a boiler or put in new windows were contained in a consultation paper released by the Department of Communities in January. Ministers believe they need some leverage to persuade households to opt for the green deal and appeals to self-interest may not be enough. The aim is to insulate up to 14m homes by 2020. More than 20 companies signed up last week to be providers.",

    "text": "For the past two years, until the end of last month, I was convener of one of the big analysis groups at the ATLAS detector on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva. This meant I was travelling a lot. So whenever I was asked to do something in London, I would say &quot;not until October&quot;. So October has been predictably busy with engagements in the UK, often at UCL. As well as the debate on Monday, I gave one of our well-known public lunch hour lectures on Tuesday this week. We were full, some people were turned away, but it was live streamed and here is the recording in case you&apos;d like to see it.            There&apos;s some overlap of material (especially jokes) with the Royal Institution evening discourse I gave in February. Except at UCL I didn&apos;t have the demonstrations  but I did have a new boson!",

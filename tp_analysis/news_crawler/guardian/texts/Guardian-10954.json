    "text": "It&apos;s well known that no world event has truly occurred until the mad geniuses at Taiwan&apos;s Next Media Animation have done one of their inspired virtual reality mockups recounting the events. Tiger Woods&apos;s post-infidelity car crash, Steve Jobs&apos;s career  there&apos;s really nothing that escapes their blocky gaze.            And now, rejoice! Because the barely comprehensible saga of John McAfee&apos;s escape, evasion, arrest and possibly extradition from and to Belize have now been rendered in glorious NMAvision. We have to say that we never knew McAfee kept trios of live laydeez in a pull-out drawer, but then again if you&apos;ve made millions by slowing people&apos;s computers down, why not? Perhaps NMA&apos;s next move will be to generate 3D print-it-yourself figurines of people in the world news. We have no idea what those would look like, but couldn&apos;t be worse than Madame Tussauds.",

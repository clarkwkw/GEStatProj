    "headline": "Should gamers declare online ceasefire after Newtown shootings?", 
    "text": "In response to the Newtown shootings, Antwand Pearman, CEO of GamerFitNation, posted an event on Facebook calling for 21 December to be a day of ceasefire for online shooters. It&apos;s gathered nearly 2,500 positive responses at the time of writing, and spawned lively discussion both on the page itself and on the #OSceasefire hashtag on Twitter. These online expressions of solidarity, sadness, grief and awareness are not new, but as games become more mainstream awareness of them has grown. Online communities of all types are now properly understood as &quot;real&quot; communities, filled with real people, real emotions and the capacity to act together in the way that offline communities do. The mass renaming of space stations in Eve Online after the death of Sean Smith in the Benghazi consulate attack is only the most high-profile example of how gamers can respond to loss and bereavement. Schools, towns, and all sorts of offline communities have come together to show their loss in the wake of the Newtown tragedy  so why not online gamers? There&apos;s a common narrative about video games in the wake of spree killings. It started with Doom after the Columbine shooting, and it continues with yesterday&apos;s Sun front page story about Adam Lanza&apos;s Call of Duty habits and, more bizarrely, the Daily Express on his love of Dynasty Warriors. The media has a nasty habit of tying violent gaming (and horror movies, and the sort of music made by men who wear eyeliner) to mass murder, though in recent years that knee-jerk reaction has been getting softer. It is not rare for 20-year-old American men to play Call of Duty; that Lanza did so is not a surprise. And while the debate about the link between game violence and real aggression is far from finished, it would be vastly overstating the current evidence to suggest that CoD or any other game could cause someone to kill. So it&apos;s been strongly argued by some critics  Kieron Gillen among them  that the ceasefire call feeds into the media&apos;s narrative, as though by laying down virtual arms gamers are accepting some link between their hobby and the grim reality of Friday&apos;s events. The critics are keen to emphasise that there is no connection, and that those who enjoy games should not need to apologise for their hobbies. The Facebook events page refrains from commenting on the violence in gaming issue, saying: &quot;We are simply making a statement that we as gamers are not going to sit back and ignore the lives that were lost. Instead we will embrace the families with our love and support.&quot; But not everyone will read that page, and in the light of the shoddy journalism around the issue it&apos;s fair to suppose that an online shooters&apos; vigil might serve to reinforce the perceived link. It&apos;s also unclear whether any of the gamers taking part have reached out to the families of those killed in Sandy Hook, to find out how they might respond to such an event. Seen as a gesture of respect, a ceasefire could be a powerful expression of a community&apos;s sorrow, especially if it is widely taken up. Seen as an admission of guilt, it risks damaging the debate around violence in games and its link with real-life crime. And, in either case, it diverts attention away from the debate about real gun control in the US, where gamers stopping shooting pretend bullets at avatars for a day does nothing to stop the next person picking up a real gun and shooting another human being.",

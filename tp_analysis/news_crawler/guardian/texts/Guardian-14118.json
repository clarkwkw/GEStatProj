    "text": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Android and Windows Phone gain, BlackBerry loses in smartphone OS share according to Kantar &gt;&gt; TechCrunch  Windows Phone isn&apos;t really posing a threat to iOS or Android, which continue to dominate smartphone share is all markets, but it is starting to pull away from BlackBerry and Symbian when it comes to making a strong showing as a third place contender. In the US, Windows accounted for 4.1% of smartphone sales in the three-month period ending February 2013, up from 2.7% for the year-ago quarter. BlackBerry, by contrast, represented only 0.7% of smartphone sales in the US according to Kantar, down from 3.6% during the same time in 2012. In the UK, BlackBerry slid from 16.8% of all smartphone sales in the three-month period ending in February last year, to just 5.1% of sales for the same span in 2013. That&apos;s a drop of 11.7 percentage points, during a period that included a full month of BB10 device sales. BlackBerry itself claimed 1 million devices shipped for its most recent fiscal quarter, which included BB10 launches in Canada and the UK, but when pressed about how much of that represented actual sales, execs hedged and noted that it was &quot;sort of&quot; closer to between two-thirds and three-quarters of that 1 million figure on its investor conference call.  Note that this is share - of phones shipped - and not installed base. Windows Phone has now overtaken BlackBerry in both the UK and US for shipments. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.) Dell Inc. &gt;&gt; SEC Filings Why should you sell your Dell stock to let the company go private? Because, say the directors, there are   fundamental changes in the PC market, including a decline in worldwide revenues for desktop and laptop PCs and lower shipment forecasts for PC products; rapidly declining margins as demand for PC products shifts from higher-margin premium products to lower cost and lower margin products, particularly in emerging markets; significant and increasing competition from efficient, low-cost manufacturers relying primarily on a build-to-stock business model, rather than the build-to-order business model historically used by the Company, and from manufacturers of innovative, higher-margin PC products, which competition could result in reduced profit margins, further loss of market share for the Company&apos;s products and services, or both; long-term challenges that are likely to affect PC sales, including a general lengthening of the replacement cycle for PC products, the uncertain adoption of the Windows 8 operating system and unexpected slowdowns in enterprise Windows 7 upgrades, increasing consumer interest in tablets and smartphones, the potential substitution of these products for PC products and the related fact that the Company currently sells tablets only in limited quantities and does not manufacture smartphones.  There are others too, but those are the main ones. (Thanks @rubbernuke for the pointer.) Gmail push notification no longer works with Mail on new iOS devices &gt;&gt; TUAW  Google&apos;s Gmail has provided push notification to iOS users through Mail.app for years, but an announced change has taken effect that will leave users with new devices without push notification in the iPhone&apos;s native mail app. Google announced in December that the Microsoft Exchange support offered with Google Sync would be removed, and the company ended that support on January 30, 2013. For those who are using the Gmail push notification feature on existing hardware, there&apos;s no cause for concern as Google has grandfathered in your accounts. However, when you get a new iOS device through an upgrade or replacement, you&apos;ll find that you can no longer receive instant push notifications for Gmail accounts.  More skirmishes in the Microsoft-Google war. This is the turning-off of Microsoft&apos;s Exchange sync for Gmail - unless you download and use Google&apos;s own mail app. (Thanks @HotSoup for the link.) Ground Control, Part 1 &gt;&gt; The Magazine Tom Tomorrow:   Last August, before domestic drones had become a concern worthy of a 13-hour Senate filibuster, I found myself inside a stretch limousine with a bunch of engineering students. We were on a rural highway in eastern North Dakota, rolling past bales of hay and soybean fields, the limo&apos;s mirrored bar set with a row of empty champagne glasses. No one paid attention to them. Instead, the student engineers were deep in a marathon conversation about flying robots.  Long, and worth it. [APK Teardown Exclusive] The HTC Myst Facebook phone - the Facebook app is now a launcher, looks like they&apos;re planning a Play Store release, too &gt;&gt; Android Police  We&apos;ve managed to score a system dump of the Facebook phone! There&apos;s nothing in it that&apos;s too earthshattering, and you could probably guess most of the features, but, since we&apos;ve got it, we might as well take a look at it. [This is not an April Fool&apos;s joke. I promise.] Now, this being Facebook, nothing really works unless you sign in. The problem is, all of this is pre-release, so it&apos;s set up to only work for Facebook employee accounts. Everything is basically packing unintentional always-on DRM, so screenshots are going to be a little sparse.  Could this be HTC&apos;s revival - or just another phone with Facebook, like the one it released a couple of years ago? Seems though the app and launcher will also work on Samsung&apos;s Touchwiz; that means an app that would be front and centre on your phone. Two ways to make a spoon: 3D printing in action &gt;&gt; Gadget Writing Tim Anderson:   Last week I attended the Monki Gras, a distinctive event exploring how to scale craft, mainly in the context of technology but also in the context of beer. On the second day there was a light-hearted competition. Who can make a spoon faster, a wood carver, or a geek with a 3D printer?  Think carefully. Apple expands &apos;Maps Ground Truth&apos; hiring to rest of the world &gt;&gt; Mac Rumors  &apos;Ground Truth&apos; refers to information collected on location versus data collected remotely, such as satellite imagery. &quot;The Maps team is searching for a manager for the team responsible for regional map quality and ground truth in the U.S.. Each of our regional teams is responsible for the quality of our maps in their region. This team&apos;s responsibilities include: &quot; Testing new releases of map code and data around the U.S. Collecting ground truth data to allow for analysis of the impact of potential map code or data changes relative to known truth Utilizing local expertise to provide feedback about U.S.-specific mapping details Evaluating competing products in-region relative to our maps  Jailbreaking declining in China, now down to 32.3% of iOS devices &gt;&gt; Tech In Asia  But that doesn&apos;t mean that Chinese Apple fans are renouncing piracy. The controversial and popular KuaiYong is an iTunes replacement that enables iOS app piracy without needing a jailbreak, so not all of the country&apos;s growing ranks of Apple fans - now up to 85m active on iOS in China - are paying up for apps. Little wonder that Chinese iOS developers are only earning an average of 3 cents (yes, US$0.03) per download.  Perhaps an indication that it&apos;s moving beyond the early adopters to wider groups? Even so, that&apos;s a really high proportion. (Via @benedictevans.)

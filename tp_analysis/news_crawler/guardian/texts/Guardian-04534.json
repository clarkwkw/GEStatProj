    "text": "Only after a day of endless warmth and sunshine are there nights like these. The air is chill and sweet, and there is a sense of hushed expectancy, as if the world is poised on the brink of something momentous. Overhead the sky has darkened not to winter&apos;s inky blue-black, but to a gentle deep blue against which a scatter of stars and a pale gold curve of moon shine softly. On the horizon a fading red blush below a swath of turquoise sky is all that remains of an earlier fiery sunset. Reflecting this last light, the larger lochs lie like pools of brightness in the landscape while, along the water courses and above the smaller lochans, a night mist drifts like a wraith. It is almost midnight but over the sea the moon is low in the sky and, once thought of, the idea of a walk to the beach to watch it sink below the horizon becomes impossible to resist. There is no need for a torch, as the track is both familiar and easy to follow. At first the call of a distant oystercatcher and the sound of footsteps are the only sounds to break the stillness. But those footsteps are enough to disturb the resting geese who rise into the air with noisy, bugling calls and a great clatter of wings. For a few brief seconds they appear as a line of fleeing silhouettes, dark against the brighter sky. An anxious lapwing protective of chicks nearby circles low overhead, its calls shrill and insistent. And suddenly from the iris bed comes a sound synonymous with Hebridean nights  the harsh, endlessly repeated rasping of a corncrake. Though the cries of the lapwing fall suddenly silent, the sound of the corncrake does not cease, merely becoming quieter with distance until it is no longer heard at all. By the time the track finally crests the dunes, all is hushed again and only the murmur of wavelets on sand accompanies the moon as it slips slowly beneath the horizon.",

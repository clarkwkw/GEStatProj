    "text": "&quot;A pinch and a punch for the first of the month,&quot; so it must be a June bug. Well, not exactly, it&apos;s properly a May bug, but this spring being what it is we&apos;re a month out anyway. The cockchafer beetle  for that&apos;s what it is  lies on the pavement, motionless like a chip of wood. It probably pinged into a car windscreen last night, giddy in the lights, burst from its grub life under a lawn to fly the last night of May and bring in June. Now it&apos;s still, stunned and cold. In a hand&apos;s warmth, bits of it open like a Swiss army knife: legs, antennae. So now it&apos;s summer? A beautiful morning travels down the lane white with the hedge-suds of cow parsley. Wrens fly over the plates of hogweed flowers. Garlic mustard hangs on to its rough little blooms as the green flames of nettle and goosegrass lick the hedge banks. Young jackdaws fledged from holes in the old ash swerve overhead. A buzzard skims the hedgetops of hazel and elm; light strikes through it and the bird becomes almost transparent. Sunlight washes over high banks and woods, making them shine with a mythic, hazy green. Trees cast shadows downhill as if the whole landscape is far from still but flowing. From the aural waves of birdsong and distant flock-calls to the breeze sighing through the treetops, this whole June landscape is moving, somewhere. Not the sheep, though  they&apos;re still lying in a moment&apos;s peace but they look strangely transported, distant in this light. Even field gates glow silver. From the lane&apos;s shadow, a fox lopes, sees me, spins around and disappears. It is moving toward the back of the hedge where the rabbits graze. &quot;Wild rabbits, white rabbits.&quot; Let the beetle and June go.",

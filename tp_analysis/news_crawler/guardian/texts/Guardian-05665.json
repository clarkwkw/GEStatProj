    "text": "    This week&apos;s Caturday morning video smile is a little bit different from the usual fare. Instead of featuring amusing and peculiar animal (or plant) behaviour, I am sharing an artsy film that will either give you a smile or make you more depressed than you already are. I&apos;m betting on a smile. This black-and-white video features a black-and-white longhaired cat named Henri, who is a perpetually depressed nihilist. The film also includes poorly pronounced French narration accompanied by amusing English subtitles and a soundtrack.             [video link] Music: &quot;Nothing has Changed&quot; performed by Vi Hart.  Henri is on facebook and twitter @HenriLeChatNoir .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  NOTE: the silly cat/pet/animal videos shared here on Saturday (Caturday) mornings are intended to amuse. This feature is designed to help hard-working and stressed-out people shed their professional faade so they can be better friends, companions, parents, family members and drinking pals to those in their personal lives. Any relationship between these videos and science or any scientific principle is sweet when I manage to present a solid connection to you, but is random, usually coincidental and (mostly) unintended.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist Pinterest: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

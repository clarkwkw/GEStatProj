    "text": "In the past couple of years, a bizarre trend has started to creep into &quot;stealth&quot; franchises, which seems aimed at making them as unstealthy as possible. Two years ago, Splinter Cell: Conviction repackaged Sam Fisher as a cross between an Olympic gymnast and Jack Bauer, whose speed at shimmying up drainpipes and along ledges belied his 53 years of age. Now Metal Gear Solid: Revengeance seems set to toss the franchise&apos;s stealth aspect into a rubbish skip altogether, in favour of a combat system that puts a premium on slicing and dicing. The latest stealth franchise to adopt this new, more action-oriented direction is IO&apos;s Hitman. In the games preceding the developer&apos;s 2012 release, Hitman Absolution, the series&apos; protagonist  the bald, bar-coded contract killer, Agent 47  was a mortal figure. It only took a few bullets and couple of wrong turns to necessitate a mission restart. He may have been proficient in death-dealing, but Agent 47 was a fragile soul. The new Agent 47 of Hitman Absolution is more like a human wrecking ball. In the play-through I witnessed this week, I watched as he took out three goons with a fire-axe, juggled automatic weapons in a gunfight, and then cleared an entire room with two firearms in slow motion.     Hitman Absolution    He didn&apos;t use cover to conceal his activities from his opponents, but rather as a shield against the wall of bullets they fired at him. The action throughout had all the high-octane impact of the best third-person-shooters  and it was absolutely nothing like the Hitman games of old. So has IO abandoned the open-ended stealth-driven gameplay that made Agent 47 such a (cough) hit with gamers? Not quite. The developers are keen to point out that the run-and-gun style of play shown to journalists in this week&apos;s demo is only one way in which players can tackle the missions in Hitman Absolution. It&apos;s what they call &quot;Non-Pro Play&quot;. Fans of the series shouldn&apos;t feel too anxious, however, because Absolution also allows for the classic Hitman experience, in which avoiding antagonists, silently taking downs goons and concealing unconscious (or dead) bodies are all key to successfully completing a mission. Impressively, these two contrasting styles of play sit very comfortably side by side, and are almost certainly guaranteed to increase Absolution&apos;s potential audience numbers.     Hitman Absolution    If you&apos;re a long-time fan of the series, preferring to keep to the shadows and glide unnoticed through missions while dropping the odd foe, this is absolutely possible. If you&apos;ve never cared much for sneaking about in the dark and favour a more direct approach, that option is open to you as well. Both styles of play are informed by the new Instinct Mechanic, which allows the player to access a couple of new abilities in the game. During stealthy sections, Agent 47 can spend Instinct to see through walls (in a fashion similar to Batman&apos;s Detective Vision in Arkham City) and note the positions of any enemies in his environment. He can also see the routes used by patrolling guards (which appear as a trail of fire), and mimic the movements of any enemies whose outfits he&apos;s stolen, so as to avoid detection. Instinct can also be used to clear entire rooms with precision gun work, as it powers a mechanic IO have named &quot;Point-Shoot&quot;. This functions in a similar way to the &quot;Dead-Eye&quot; mechanic in Red Dead Redemption, giving the player has a brief window in which they can tag both opponents and exploding items in their environment. Once this is done, the action plays out on screen as though it&apos;s been shot by Guy Ritchie; the camera whirls about the environment tracking each shot in slow motion, furnishing the player with the gruesome results of their handiwork in the most cinematic way possible. It should be noted at this point that Instinct isn&apos;t always available to the player; it needs to be earned. By performing takedowns, hiding from danger and hiding the bodies of downed opponents, players fill Agent 47&apos;s Instinct meter, which appears in the right hand side of the game&apos;s HUD. This is presumably to prevent the player from being too overpowered and also to steer them towards using the game&apos;s stealth mechanics for at least some of the time. The level in which IO demonstrated Agent 47&apos;s rather sexy new abilities, we were told, takes place early on in the game.     Hitman Absolution    After despatching his former handler, Diana Burnwood, Agent 47 agrees to fulfil her dying wish, which is that he protect a young woman named Victoria who resides at the Rosewood Orphanage in Chicago. Once he arrives there, it soon becomes apparent that Burnwood wasn&apos;t the only person interested in Victoria, as the orphanage is swarming with armed thugs who have massacred most of the nuns who worked there. The environment was suitably atmospheric; most of the rooms looked dank and darkly-lit, with the odd, sweetly coloured playroom contrasting nicely with the action on screen. Aside from the death of Burnwood, IO was tight-lipped about any plot details, although the developers did say their intention with the plot was to reveal more about their stoic killer to player than in previous games. The fact that they were prepared to reveal Burnwood&apos;s death as a plot point seems to indicate IO wants players to view Hitman Absolution as something of a break with the past, but at the same time, they haven&apos;t forgotten their IP&apos;s roots. More than any other stealth franchise that has previously made a bid to capture the shooter crowd, Hitman Absolution feels like a natural evolution of the series. It may boast some shiny new aspects but crucially, it&apos;s kept what made the series special to begin with. Agent 47, it seems, isn&apos;t about to trade stealth for action entirely, but he&apos;s easily more deadly than ever before.  Hitman Absolution will be released for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 later this year",

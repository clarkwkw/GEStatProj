    "text": "My father, Philip Adey, who has died aged 73, was a chemistry teacher turned educationist and author. He devoted the majority of his working life to researching and promoting the teaching of thinking skills in school. His work on science teaching methods produced significant gains at GCSE, not only in science but also in maths and English. The method was further developed for primary education. Philip was born in Sevenoaks, Kent. After attending Bryanston school, Dorset, he gained a BSc in chemistry and a PGCE and Academic Diploma in Education from the London Institute of Education. Appointed head of chemistry at the Lodge school in Barbados in 1963, he left in 1970 to become a consultant on the Caribbean Integrated Science Project based at the University of the West Indies. Returning to the UK in 1974 to complete his PhD at Chelsea College of Science and Technology, he then worked for the British Council in London and Jakarta, Indonesia, from 1979 to 1984. He went on to be a researcher, lecturer, senior lecturer, reader and professor at King&apos;s College London. After retiring in 2004, he continued working in Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Hungary and Poland. He was recently the education commissioner for Westminster city council. Throughout his period at Chelsea and King&apos;s, Philip pursued a research and development programme related to the assessment and enhancement of school students&apos; intellectual ability. This led to a series of publications on cognitive acceleration and professional development programmes for teachers. His work with Michael Shayer and Carolyn Yates was highly influential. With Shayer, he wrote two bestselling books, Towards a Science of Science Teaching (1981) and Really Raising Standards: Cognitive Intervention and Educational Achievement (1994). Thinking Science, the curriculum materials of the Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (Case) project, written with Shayer and Yates, can still be found in schools throughout the UK and beyond. His later work on Case in primary schools involved a number of colleagues in the UK, the US and Australia. Philip was tireless and intellectually rigorous, and engaged all on equal terms. His warmth and wit could light up a room. He was an excellent speaker and thousands of teachers have been inspired during his professional development sessions. His commitment to high-quality science education for all was evident throughout his career. He delighted in challenging many of the orthodoxies held dear by politicians and policymakers, and debunking myths in education. His last book, Bad Education, was published last November. Philip is survived by his second wife, Jadwiga, whom he married in 2006; by his sons, Lewis and myself, from his first marriage, to Jennifer, who died in 2003; by Jadwiga&apos;s daughters, Lucy and Sophie; and by his grandchildren, Ayesha, Kamilah, Saffron and Leo.",

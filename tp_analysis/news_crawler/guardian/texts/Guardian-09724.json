    "text": "Six Italian seismologists have been convicted of manslaughter by a court in L&apos;Aquila. We don&apos;t yet know how seriously this prosecution will affect scientists&apos; willingness to give advice to the Italian authorities or those of any other country, though the chairman of Italy&apos;s serious risks commission has just resigned, so the signs are not good. What we do know is that when the free flow of scientific advice is chilled, people pay with their lives. The treatment of the Italian seismologists is at the extraordinary end of how badly things can go for scientists who fall foul of policymakers. The response in scientific communities around the world has been shock and condemnation. But it has also been one of recognition that this simply compounds the many risks involved in giving scientific advice, particularly on health and environmental hazards. Those risks might not include jail but they already have a chilling effect on what scientists are prepared to say and whether they are prepared to contribute to policy deliberations at all. When Professor David Nutt was sacked from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs for publicly contradicting the UK government&apos;s view about the dangers of ecstasy, it had an immediate effect on policy access to independent advice. Five more members of the committee resigned and many others declared that they would not serve on another advisory committee. Researchers saw Nutt&apos;s dismissal as consistent with the Home Office&apos;s continued attempts to ensure the scientific view on drug harms matched its press releases rather than the data. The silencing effect on scientific advice happens easily because policy demands are intense. The Phillips Report into the BSE crisis made the fundamental point that much of the scientific advice to government at that time was characterised by acquiescence and an unwillingness to stand up to political pressure. Since the Phillips Report, the need for independent scientific advice has been given greater formal recognition, with codes of conduct for commissioning such advice. However, while the value of scientific evidence, openness and independence may now be established, this doesn&apos;t seem to have reduced attempts by politicians to suborn or silence that evidence when it is inconvenient. When scientists venture into the public domain and contribute to policy decisions they already face many unwanted consequences. Scientists who worked on Gulf War Syndrome met with campaigns of personal harassment. Researchers looking into a self-administered antidote to heroin overdose have been subjected to vexatious complaints about professional misconduct. Medics, science writers and journals have all faced ruinously expensive libel actions for speaking up about evidence. In countries where there is still an offence of criminal libel, such as France and Peru, such cases have also been brought against scientists. Science is founded on the collaborative open exchange necessary to develop a true picture of our world, of what has happened and what is likely to happen. From volcanology to climate, bird flu to prion disease, we need to be sure that the best available knowledge is just that  available. It means that we depend on scientists, often at fraught moments and with lives at stake, being willing to speak truth, as they see it at that point with all the caveats and uncertainties, to power. The problem for politicians making a decisive policy intervention on the basis of uncertain scientific knowledge is a real one. Scientists need to be aware of it, but politicians and officials need for their part to be more restrained in their search for certainty from scientists, to be wise to the risks that scientists already overcome to speak publicly and to the danger of creating a situation where they are only told what they want to hear. Government agencies need to develop an approach of clarifying uncertainty with scientists and handling it in policy communications. Efforts are under way in some areas, and there are an increasing number of initiatives and tools to do this. Suppression and criminal charges are not among them.

For some entrepreneurial young people, being another cog in a wheel just isn&apos;t an option. If you&apos;re nervous about A-level results day  and even more terrified by the thought of Clearing  it&apos;s worth remembering that there are plenty of other options, from apprenticeships to college courses. But for those who have the drive and independence to go it alone, here&apos;s some inspiration from the Alan Sugars of our generation.  Luke Hood, founder of UKF, a YouTube channel that has now had over 1 billion views, gave up his forensic computing course at the University of West England after a surge in the channel&apos;s popularity. UKF aims &quot;to promote the latest and greatest high quality dubstep&quot; and they now have their own website, www.ukfmusic.com which advertises UKF events, sells tickets and merchandise, and offers podcasts. He isn&apos;t the only one who ditched university in favour of his entrepreneurial ambitions.  Creator of Corporate Group David Carter decided not to study at university when his business found success in 2010. He clocked onto the application industry&apos;s potential, realising that thousands of apps sold everyday for 99p each. The App Factory not only creates its own applications, but also produces apps for other companies.  It was a passion for music that directed Jamal Edwards to business success. He founded SB.TV in 2006, a media platform for freestyle rap and British grime music videos. The likes of Usher, Channel 4 and Adidas have since name dropped the channel, while Jamal was nominated to carry the Olympic torch for the 2012 Olympics. But you don&apos;t have to be a techno-whizz to become an entrepreneur.  Fraser Doherty started his business at the age of 14. He made his fortune using his grandmother&apos;s recipe to make Super Jam. The brand is now sold in over 2,000 supermarkets across the world. And it isn&apos;t just a money-making project. Drawing inspiration from his grandmother, he created the registered charity the Super Jam Tea Parties, free parties held for elderly people who are living alone or in care homes.  GiveMeTap is another business that&apos;s creating a better future for the wider community. Edwin Broni-Mensah was the brain behind the venture which aims to change the way we access water in the UK and build water supplies across Africa. GiveMeTap works by getting businesses across the country to back the label  customers then buy the GiveMeTap bottle which they use to fill up at any of the participating businesses. For every two bottles sold, one person can gain access to safe water for life. Higher education can be a great way forward, and for some of the above, it may have helped them on their journey. But entrepreneurship is not about the degree you have, it&apos;s about the ideas you think up and the effort you&apos;re willing to put into them.",

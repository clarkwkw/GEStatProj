    "headline": "Are policies to make businesses cut energy use working?", 
    "text": "All eyes are on the energy bill today, as pressure mounts on Liberal Democrat MPs to vote for a decarbonisation target. The amendment would require steep cuts in carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2030. Businesses are keen on clean energy, and decarbonising electricity generation is an important way of achieving carbon reduction goals in the private sector. However, other aspects of the energy bill are seeing less support from businesses. In May, the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change (Decc)respondedto the electricity demand reduction consultation, which sets out to deliver cuts in national electricity demand. The response confirmed that the energy bill would include a market-wide approach to reducing energy, instead of targeting specific energy intensive sectors. This decision follows last years launch of theEnergy Efficiency Deployment Office(EEDO), which aims to drive a step change in energy efficiency in the UK. Its meant to support the coherent delivery of existing energy efficiency policies, which some in industry see as confusing.     Graphic: CBI    We see that the policy landscape in this area for a number of organisations is quite confusing - there are issues of a great deal of overlap, says Fergus McReynolds, senior policy adviser at the UK manufacturers organisationEEF. McReynolds believes the governments idea to pay businesses to reduce energy use wouldnt be the most effective strategy:  The requirement to have measurement, monitoring, and qualifications of those savings would be paramount. Our concern is that it could be quite an onerous task on organisations.It will be difficult to find an economy-wide saving mechanism that can be applied to all industries  from supermarkets to a steel-manufacturing site  if we dont have good grasp on what the barriers are in each individual sector.I think that an economy-wide approach probably wont deliver the level of savings that looking specifically at different sectors would.  One the other hand, and perhaps unsurprisingly, theClimate Change Agreement Scheme(CCA) gets full support from EEF. The CCA allows eligible energy-intensive businesses to receive up to a 65% discount from theClimate Change Levyin return for meeting energy efficiency or carbon-saving targets. The CCA has a number of significant benefits, said McReynolds. It balances well with the carrot and stick of legislation  it provides relief from a top line energy tax, but it also has within it the suitable mechanisms to ensure that companies seek to meet the requirements. He points out that it is also based on what is technically feasible by organisations to do. The one criticism we have of the scheme is that we dont feel its coverage is necessarily wide enough. There are parts of the manufacturing sector as a whole which are not eligible because of the narrow definition of eligibility for the Climate Change Agreement. McReynolds points out that before the government introduces brand new mechanisms to unlock economy wide savings, we should be reviewing policies that are currently in place. TheEnhanced Capital Allowancescheme, for example, already gives incentives for organisations to look at energy efficient technologies. Understanding what such mechanisms are doing and how they are delivering is crucial. Perhaps expanding policies that are currently in place would see more success than overlapping them with new regulations. However, tweaking policies can also risk undoing a well-functioning mechanism  theCRC Energy Efficiency Schemeis a case in point. The CRC is a mandatory carbon emissions reporting and pricing scheme that looks to reduce energy consumption in large public and private sector organisations. It applies primarily to energy users such as retailers and office spaces. According to Myles McCarthy at the Carbon Trust, the changes that took place to the scheme over the past couple of years are for the worst. Instead of returning the tax revenue collected under the scheme as originally intended, the government changed the scheme in 2010 so that it pockets the charges they apply per tonne of carbon emissions. It took time for businesses to get their heads around the regulations and their financial implications - the governments U-turn decision threw them off. Taking out the recycling revenue element did damage what was a well-designed scheme. It made a lot of logical sense to reward those that were delivering year on year savings and penalise those that were not, says McCarthy. Although the UKs framework appears on the whole undirected, McCarthy is hopeful that there is logic in how energy policies are evolving, in terms of reaching an increasingly larger part of the non-domestic sector. So how does the UK industry compare to other nations? Speaking to other manufacturers in Europe, UK manufacturing is a very competitive and energy efficient manufacturing base, said McReynolds. However,Eurostat datashows that larger industrial energy users in the UK are currently paying higher electricity prices than the EU 15 median. One of the things we have concern over going forward is that there are a number of mechanisms which will start to increase their burden over the course of the next two or three years - notably the carbon price support mechanism, which adds additional cost to electricity,&quot; said McReynolds. The government recently introduced a newcarbon price floor, which will charge firms 16 per tonne of CO2 emitted. This will apply to fuels used for power generation this year. On the carbon floor price, McReynolds said:We have concern that by the end of this parliament, that this one policy alone could potentially add 10% to electricity prices in the manufacturing sector. We are seeing increasing unilateral policy adding to those costs and creating more disparity between Europe and ourselves.

    "text": "Fully two hours before sunrise, a robin&apos;s high voice pierced through the bedroom window. I lay and listened. Each short phrase was as a dying breath, plucked out of silence, tailing off into nothingness. This particular bird had an individual variation on the standard robin repertoire of melancholy. Out it came  a rumbustious, exuberant &quot;tiddly-tiddly-tiddly-tiddly&quot;. This robin had sat in the hedge in late December, practising soft sibilants of sub-song. Now, a month later, it was in full-throated cry. It was impossible to stay still. I rose and went out into the night for more of the pre-dawn chorus. There were robins front, back and sides. It seemed as if every street light was illuminated with song. Every singer was fighting for its aural space, the voices clashing and overlapping in a fugue of dense complexity. Over this chorus and over the rooftops from the west and east came a blackbird duet, strident, sustained and yet still melodic. The diva majesty in their performance was undermined by the base scrapping of two of their kind somewhere on the grass in front of me. I could hear the chuck-chucks of indignation and caught blurry glimpses of movement as the birds battled for ownership of the roadside verge. Farther down the road in an uplit sycamore on the boundary of the park, a song thrush uttered its thrice-repeated song. He was a soloist on this spot, for there were no competitors within earshot. Looking up into branches that had a purple background of sky, I could just make out his pale belly. The bird looked like a pussy willow catkin against a twig. And then it was gone. A few seconds later its voice came again, this time from high in a lamp-post-lit tree across the road, where it could see and be seen. The song thrush sang on into the darkness, a sentinel on this false dawn.",

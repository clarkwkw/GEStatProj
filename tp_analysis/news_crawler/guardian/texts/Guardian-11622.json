    "text": "The seemingly unstoppable Lego series of platforming adventure games is set to continue this year with a new set of ultra-powered allies. Lego Marvel Super Heroes is coming to multiple platforms this autumn. The game will feature a range of comic book legends including Hulk, Thor, Wolverine and Spider-Man, coming together to save the world from a cabal of super villains. Loki and Galactus have already been named. The storyline will apparently &quot;compliment&quot; the eight Lego Marvel playsets currently available, which feature various classic scenes from major comic series&apos;. Environments will include well-known Marvel locales such as New York, but the game will also, &quot;take the adventure beyond Earth to iconic locations in the Marvel Universe,&quot; according to Tom Stone, MD of Lego games creator, TT Games Publishing. Players will be able to unlock 100 superhero characters to supplement the main cast: Deadpool, Captain America and Hawkeye are on the list, no doubt exhibiting certain signature powers of their namesakes.  The announcement comes after the significant success of DC tie-ins Lego Batman and Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes. And to ensure as many Marvel fanatics as possible get to play, the game is coming to Xbox, PS3, Wii U, PC, DS and 3DS. Guesses, please, for the next &apos;franchise crossover&apos; in the series. Lego Star Trek, maybe?",

    "text": "At the Liberal Democrat spring conference last year in Sheffield a detailed amendment to a motion on the health and social care bill was passed by the conference.  I was a co-sponsor of that amendment. What follows is an analysis of the motion and the degree to which its requirements have been met and what amendments to the bill could have been made to deliver on that motion more fully. (These amendments are given in full in an appendix at the end of this post.) The Lib Dem amendment (with my comments indented): Conference recognises however that all of the above policies and aspirations can be achieved without adopting the damaging and unjustified market-based approach that is proposed.  Conference regrets that some of the proposed reforms have never been Liberal Democrat policy, did not feature in our manifesto or in the agreed Coalition Programme, which instead called for an end to large-scale top-down re-organisations. Conference therefore calls on Liberal Democrats in Parliament to amend the Health Bill to provide for: I) More democratically accountable commissioning.    This is not delivered via clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), but could be delivered if health and wellbeing boards (HWBs) were more democratic and they, and the local authority overview and scrutiny function, could hold CCGs to account democratically by  Amendment (A) to ensure that the voting members of HWBs are elected or that a majority of the HWB are elected representatives. Amendment (B) to ensure that disputes between HWBs and CCGs are ultimately resolved in favour of the democratic body or by a democratically accountable arbitrator. Amendment (C) to ensure that where the local authority overview and scrutiny function disputes a decision of a CCG the matter is referred to an elected person or body (eg the Secretary of State) for resolution and not a quango.  II) A much greater degree of coterminosity between local authorities and commissioning areas.  Not delivered. There is only a non-statutory declaration of a &quot;presumption&quot; of coterminosity.This could be delivered by amendment (D) which provided that affected HWBs and local authorities need to approve non-coterminous CCGs  III) No decision about the spending of NHS funds to be made in private and without proper consultation, as can take place by the proposed GP consortia.  Delivered  IV) The complete ruling out of any competition based on price to prevent loss-leading corporate providers under-cutting NHS tariffs, and to ensure that healthcare providers &apos;compete&apos; on quality of care.  Delivered   V) New private providers to be allowed only where there is no risk of &apos;cherry-picking&apos; which would destabilise or undermine the existing NHS service relied upon for emergencies and complex cases, and where the needs of equity, research and training are met.  Not delivered. This could be delivered by amendment (E) placing duty on CCGs, NHS Commissioning Board (NCB), Monitor and the Care Quality Commission to act with a view to ensuring that remaining and essential services are not destabilised by a loss of income or of clinical caseload  VI) NHS commissioning being retained as a public function in full compliance with the Human Rights Act and Freedom of Information laws, using the skills and experience of existing NHS staff rather than the sub-contracting of commissioning to private companies.  Not delivered. Needs an amendment (F) to ban the WHOLESALE outsourcing of commissioning support to non-pubic sector bodies  VII) The continued separation of the commissioning and provision of services to prevent conflicts of interests.  Delivered  VIII) An NHS, responsive to patients&apos; needs, based on co-operation rather than competition, and which promotes quality and equity not the market.  Not delivered   Needs amendments (G) to stop competition/choice being pursued by commissioners at the expense of equity of access and equality of outcome by raising the duty on CCGs and the NCB to tackle inequity and inequality to the &quot;act with a view to&quot; level and reduce the duty on CCGs and the NCB to promote innovation and enable choice to the &quot;have regard for the need to&quot; level And needs further amendments (H) to make Monitor a balanced regulator by  including &quot;anti-collaborative&quot; as well as &quot;anti-competitive&quot; practices which go against the patient&apos;s interests as those which need to be prevented  clause 61  similar amendments to clause 73 and 97  give Monitor enforcement powers on its duty to secure integration (as well as duties around competition)  clause 73   There have been a number of amendments to the bill which improve it in other areas, but the above eight were specifically required by the Lib Dem Conference. And in summary, of the eight broad (or in some cases narrow) &quot;asks&quot; three have been delivered and five have not.  On that basis, assuming no changes are made to the bill, I advise Liberal Democrat party activists at the forthcoming Spring Conference to call for the bill to be dropped.  ************************************************************  Appendix  For the anoraks reading this science blog (there must be a few) these are the amendments I knocked out in an afternoon to deliver these changes - these amendments are to the current version of the bill as it left the Lords&apos; Committee stage.

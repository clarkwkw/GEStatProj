    "text": "Favourable weather and good planning avoided major air pollution problems during the Olympics, prompting the University of Manchester to suggest that the London Games may have been the least polluted Olympics in recent times. Good news, but the Games were not pollution free. In the final four days of the Games, air began circulating over England and the near continent causing increases in ground level ozone. Increased air pollution presents a health risk to us all but it can be a much bigger problem for marathon runners due to sheer volumes of air that they breathe during the race. By scheduling the race in the morning the organisers avoided the afternoon peak in ground level ozone, and pollution was below the World Health Organisation&apos;s guidelines. The cycling road race passed through some of London&apos;s most polluted streets, including Putney High Street and roads around Knightsbridge; however, road closures during the events were very effective in reducing air pollution concentrations which remained low. On the last afternoon of the Games a huge fire broke out in Dagenham, east London, around 10km from the Olympic Park. Over 200 firefighters with 40 fire engines fought the blaze, London&apos;s biggest fire for several years, and brought it under control before the closing ceremony. Favourable weather meant that the smoke rapidly dispersed and did not cause any pollution problems.",

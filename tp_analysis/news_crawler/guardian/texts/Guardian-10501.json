    "text": "Imagine a game you control with a book. Not a virtual book, but one made of paper and card and binding glue. Welcome, then, to Wonderbook, a game that could not offer a more vivid and attractive alternative to the gung-ho chest-beating of Call of Duty. It works on a simple, if a little unusual, premise. The book&apos;s pages are not filled with words, but with symbols incomprehensible to the human eye. These garbled patterns, however, mean a great deal to the optionally bundled PlayStation Eye camera. The device sits atop the TV, filming player and book. Onscreen that scene is recreated, but here the symbols have become animated pages and scenes that spill beyond the paper&apos;s edge into the virtual living room on screen, with which the player can interact using Sony&apos;s Move controller. The TV is effectively turned into a mirror reflecting an augmented reality. The first release on offer here is Book of Spells, authored by JK Rowling, offering lessons in magic for Harry Potter devotees, who will thrill to the wand-waving interaction it offers, but the physical book is to remain a constant and over time new titles for it will be unveiled, including releases featuring characters from Disney and the BBC&apos;s Walking With Dinosaurs. If this vibrant debut is anything to go by, its future looks positively enchanting.",

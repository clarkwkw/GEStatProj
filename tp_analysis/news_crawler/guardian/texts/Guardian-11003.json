    "text": "For many years Patrick has been a dear friend and a kind of father figure to me. I am going to miss him terribly, as are all his close friends and colleagues; and the world has lost a treasure that can never be replaced. Patrick was the last of a generation, a true gentleman, the most generous that I ever knew; an inspiration to thousands in his personal life and to millions through his 50 years of unique broadcasting. It&apos;s no exaggeration to say that Patrick, in his tireless and ebullient communication of the magic of astronomy, inspired every British astronomer, amateur and professional, for half a century. Most astronomers I know will tell you Patrick is the reason they first looked through a telescope. Through his countless books and articles and TV appearances, he captured the adventure of the universe and brought it to us. He knew the universe in a way that will never be equalled. He did not just know the facts, it was as if he lived out there and knew it like the back of his hand. To the end of his life he was distilling new discoveries into channels which made them not just accessible to astronomers but also understandable to the general public  a rare gift, which he never tired of using to the full. In his private life Patrick was astoundingly giving. His dedication to young aspiring astronomers was legendary. He replied to every letter, responded to questions, helped students with gifts of equipment and the most precious gift of all  his time. He personally tutored some he thought particularly promising, and sponsored others through higher education; he gave away any income he made to the point where he had no security himself except that which his friends supplied. He always insisted he was an amateur astronomer, but his contribution to pure research was considerable. He made the first finely detailed map of the moon&apos;s surface  consulted by the first astronauts to walk on the lunar surface. From the days before astrophotography was well developed, his notes and drawings from his thousands of hours of pure observations are now a valuable archive. Patrick was the reason I took up astronomy as a kid, but it was on a trip to the northern tip of Scotland to witness an annular eclipse  a rare sight  that he turned my life around again. We sat down for a snack outdoors, and he said: &quot;We must write a book together  the Complete History of the Universe.&quot; I said: &quot; Really I don&apos;t think I am capable  I have been in a different world for so long. Maybe I can help you edit it?&quot; He said: &quot;Nonsense! You are going to co-author it and you&apos;re going to go back and get your PhD too!&quot; Well, it all came true. We wrote Bang! The Complete History of the Universe together with Chris Lintott and I finished off my PhD thesis at Imperial College. Patrick had once again brought me face to face with the universe. Patrick was a great caring human being, and campaigner for the rights and welfare of animals. His cats were the loves of his life and he was outspoken against cruelty of all kinds. Recently he spoke out against the government&apos;s proposed massacre of badgers. Patrick had other talents. He was a lifelong devotee of cricket and an accomplished musician, playing both piano and xylophone in public with great success. He wrote science fiction, plays, spoof operas, and satirical commentaries on the foolishness of bureaucracy, under the assumed name of RT Fishall. He ribbed those who believed in flying saucers or astrology, but had an open mind as to whether intelligent life may exist elsewhere in the universe. The honour he was most proud of was being made a Fellow of the Royal Society  the only amateur astronomer to achieve this distinction, but he was also made a knight in 2001. Patrick will be mourned by the many to whom he was a caring uncle, and by all who loved the delightful wit and clarity of his writings, or enjoyed his fearlessly eccentric persona in public life. Patrick is irreplaceable. There will never be another Patrick Moore. But we were lucky enough to get one. Brian May has set up a website where members of the public can leave personal tributes to the late Sir Patrick Moore at banguniverse.com",

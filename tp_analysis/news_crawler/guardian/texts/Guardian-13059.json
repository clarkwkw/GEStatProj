    "text": "A vibrant hub for Scotland&apos;s creative and cultural industries, as well as health and social care students, the 81m Ayr campus development was launched in January last year, and is a key component of a multi-campus investment programme at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS). http://www.uws.ac.uk/home/  The reasoning behind making such a significant investment in a new facility was, says Professor Seamus McDaid, UWS principal and vice chancellor, &quot;to act as an inspiring choice for prospective students at national and international level and enhance the economy of the area on a significant scale.&quot;  The development was not embarked upon alone: funds were pooled by both the UWS and its HE partner SRUC (Scotland&apos;s Rural University College http://www.sruc.ac.uk/), and seven other stakeholders have contributed including the Scottish Funding Council, South Ayrshire Council and Scottish Natural Heritage. Importantly for a area known for its countryside, environmental concerns were high on the list of development priorities, and the new facility is built on a former brownfield site in mature woodland. Despite being a four storey structure, some of it is subterranean, and care was taken to make sure that the topmost part of the building stayed below the level of surrounding trees. Its BREEAM excellence rating means it will also contribute to UWS&apos; commitment to 20% carbon reduction by 2014.",

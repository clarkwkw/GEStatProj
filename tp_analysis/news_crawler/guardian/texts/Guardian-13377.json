    "text": "The underrepresentation of women in the higher education sector continues to attract attention. A recent report Sex and Power 2013: Who Runs Britain? published in the Observer revealed the absence of women in senior roles in UK higher education (as other sectors), with figures showing only 14.2% of vice chancellors are female. Another report published by the UCU suggested one in five professors are women (20.5%), despite the fact they make up almost half (47.3%) of the non-professorial academic workforce. And this is not only a UK picture. In Australia, for example, research shows that despite policy reforms, inequity in terms of pay and status continues to be a problem, with few women academics employed in senior positions. And as Louise Tickle reported this week, some of the fastest growing higher education systems have the poorest records on gender parity. At the British Council&apos;s Going Global conference in Dubai this week, a manifesto calling for university rankings to take the gender gap into account was discussed by an international grouping of senior women. It is part of a range of measures demanded to redress the poor representation of women in academic leadership and research in many countries including the UK. As recent coverage of this subject on the higher education network has shown, there are many issues at hand: 1. Recruitment. Many departments in universities are failing to recruit as many women as they do men to senior positions. When Cardiff University School of Medicine carried out a self-assessment of their department, they discovered they recruited twice as many men as women to the senior lecturer grade, and had three times as many male professional recruits. How can departments ensure more women are selected, or applying, for more senior roles? 2. Applications. Some research shows that women are less inclined to apply for a promotion compared to men, and that they tend to be less motivated and career orientated. This sounds like a broad generalisation, but, why then aren&apos;t women applying for professional posts? 3. Working methods. Women do not appear to write as many sole author articles as expected, according to research conducted by Karen Schucan Bird, but are more likely to embrace co-authorship with other women. Perhaps Bird is right to be worried, with research highlighting a gender bias in the peer-review system for postdoctoral fellowship applications in Sweden, leading to peer reviewers overestimating male achievements and/or underestimating female performance. For women to achieve parity in universities, policy measures are needed, but so are practical and innovative ideas that can be applied globally. Today&apos;s live chat can get us thinking about how to share ideas and spread best practice internationally. Join our #HElivechat Friday 8 March from 12-2pm to discuss whether it&apos;s time to make the conversation around female career progression in higher education a global one.

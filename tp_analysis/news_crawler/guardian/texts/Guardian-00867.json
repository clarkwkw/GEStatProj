    "text": "One of the finest iPhone games of 2011 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade this month, finally arriving on the platform it was originally designed for. The ridiculously clever word game Quarrel began as a downloadable Xbox title back in 2009, but Scottish developer Denki was unable to secure publisher support for the project and last spring had to make most of its staff redundant.  However, after a critically acclaimed debut on iOS devices in August, the game has now earned an Xbox release courtesy of publisher, UTV Ignition Games. &quot;To be frank, Quarrel seeing the light of day at all last year on iOS was the single best achievement to unlock,&quot; says lead designer, Gary Penn. &quot;But that&apos;s not to take anything away from the &apos;original&apos; version being released at last  that definitely feels like a full closure of sorts and a blessed relief.&quot; Described as a fiendish cross between Risk and Scrabble (with elements of TV show Countdown chucked in), Quarrel tasks players with defeating a group of AI opponents in a series of word creation face-offs. Victory, gains the winner of each bout new territory on the game map, but spreading your forces to thinly means you have less letters at your disposal in forthcoming word fights. In November, the title was awarded a Scottish Bafta for best video game. According to Penn, the new Xbox version will boast four-player online and local multiplayer options with avatar support, as well a brand new set of features and game modes: &quot;Showdown is a series of head-to-head matches with each character and some new board variations,&quot; he explains, &quot;while Challenge presents you with a set of special &apos;missions&apos; focusing on specific Quarrel qualities, such as trailblazing. Plus, artificial players are more human and entertaining than ever.&quot; The Xbox version of Quarrel will launch on 25 January for 400 Microsoft Points. The first essential XBLA purchase of the year? We think so.",

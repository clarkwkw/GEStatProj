    "headline": "Budget 2012: George Osborne's fossil-fuelled fantasy is the road to nowhere", 
    "text": "To get UK plc motoring, George Osborne vowed in the 2011 budget to &apos;put fuel into the tank of the British economy&apos;. What he revealed on Wednesday is that the nation&apos;s tank is to be filled with fossil fuels. The chancellor took 2bn pounds from the oil and gas industry last year - to cut petrol duty  but now he has handed back at least 3bn to the fossil fuel giants. That&apos;s the size of the tax breaks for exploration of the deep water fields to the west of Shetland and to squeeze the last drops from the North Sea. He will also lock-in up to 75% tax breaks for decommissioning oil rigs in the North Sea  that&apos;s a 30 billion pound liability. What happened to the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle, one might ask, especially in relation to a fully mature industry that has sucked up billions in subsidies over decades? Perhaps wrong-track thinking on energy is unsurprising when Osborne - who is also backing a dash-for-gas for electricity generation - managed to warn both of the dangers of high oil prices and the benefits of &quot;cheap&quot; gas in the same speech. He&apos;s clearly not paid the energy bill for No11 Downing Street recently: soaring gas prices have caused 80% of the bill rises seen in recent years. Or perhaps it&apos;s the company he keeps: climate sceptic and former chancellor Nigel Lawson, ExxonMobil, Total and trade body Oil and Gas UK, according to the most up-to-date record of his meetings. Renewable energy, which can get the UK off the oil hook for good, was name-checked in a positive manner: &quot;a crucial part in Britain&apos;s energy mix&quot;. That&apos;s a relief for the sector which said Osborne&apos;s previous trash-talk on the environment had driven up political risk and therefore investment costs, possibly by billions. Before the speech, Danny Alexander told the Guardian that the rhetoric had certainly been unhelpful and that the LibDems were working hard to stop it. A partial success, then, but there were no significant new measures to support the fledgling clean energy industry. Instead, the chancellor confirmed the nation&apos;s planning laws will be subject to the &quot;biggest reduction in business red tape ever undertaken&quot;. He said hundreds of jobs were being lost to failed planning permissions, though I doubt he was thinking of those at the two waste-to-energy plants he has vigorously opposed in his own constituency. Either way, it will certainly not be enough to convince the millions of concerned people who see the planning as driving through a &apos;developers charter&apos;, risking the concreting of the countryside. CPRE called the chancellor&apos;s rhetoric &quot;misguided and dangerous&quot; - the British Property Federation welcomed it. Osborne said the country&apos;s &quot;most precious environments&quot; would be protected, but we won&apos;t find out what that actually means until Tuesday, when the full planning reforms are revealed.  Osborne&apos;s budget also banks a billion for business through the cutting of environmental regulations. But his previous outburst about &quot;ridiculous&quot; EU rules protecting our most threatened wildlife and landscapes has rightly vanished. This red tape was in fact a red herring and has apparently vanished in red-faced shame. The UK&apos;s creaking infrastructure was rightly a target for Osborne, but &quot;confronting the lack of airport capacity in the South East of England&quot; looks ominously like preparation for a handbrake-turn on the Tory opposition to a third runway at Heathrow, or pushing ahead with Boris Johnson&apos;s daft &quot;fantasy island&quot; airport in the Thames estuary. Either development would turbo-charge one of the biggest risks to the UK crashing through its carbon reduction targets and so failing to tackle climate change. As for the environmental silver linings, the list of biggest potentially positive green moves tells you all you need to know about the level of green ambition in this dark gray budget: possible reform of an energy-efficiency tax called the carbon reduction commitment; incentives for greener company cars; and a tweaking of combined heat and power schemes. The government torched its aspiration to be the &quot;greenest government ever&quot; in Osborne&apos;s toxic autumn statement in 2011. In this budget, he demonstrated how little he understands the real source of a nation&apos;s wealth. &quot;Environmentally sustainable has to be fiscally sustainable too,&quot; he argued. Yet the reverse is the greater truth: short-term economic growth fuelled by environmental degradation is the road to nowhere.",

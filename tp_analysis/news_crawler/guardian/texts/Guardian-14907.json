Call of Duty: Ghosts outed by Tesco - box art appears online | Videogamer Oops:  Call of Duty: Ghosts - expected to be this year&apos;s Call of Duty title - has been outed by UK retailer Tesco. The retailer listed the game for Xbox 360 and PS3 this afternoon, along with the alleged box art. It has since pulled both listings, however. Infinity Ward&apos;s logo is featured prominently on the box art, suggesting the Modern Warfare developer is back for Ghosts, and also appears to show a character putting on the mask worn by Ghost in Modern Warfare 2.  Ah well, these things happen  retailers have often done this sort of thing in the past  as long as it&apos;s a one off it... wait, what&apos;s that?! &apos;Upcoming Halo&apos; appears on Tesco&apos;s site | Videogamer  An unannounced Halo title has also appeared on the retailer&apos;s website, suggesting that a new game in the sci-fi shooter series may be headed to Xbox 360 later in the year. &apos;Upcoming Halo&apos; has been listed on the site, along with a generic Xbox 360 box art and (presumably) placeholder December 31, 2013 date.   Microsoft swiftly moved in to discredit the posting, stating, &quot;This listing is not indicative of a Halo product launch. We have no news to share of future Halo titles.&quot; At this point I&apos;m imagining a junior member of the Tesco Direct website team being dragged away from their keyboard  possibly seconds before they could upload a photo of the next Xbox and box art for The Last Guardian. Disney sees Infinity as game platform with &quot;infinite&quot; possibilities | GamesIndustry International In an interview with the games industry site, Disney exec Bill Roper talks about the forthcoming Infinity title and refuses to rule out appearances by Star Wars or Marvel characters:  &quot;I think the beauty of something like Infinity is that it&apos;s a platform that we&apos;re building. So we don&apos;t try to be coy about it - we&apos;ve done a lot of work about identifying the properties that we felt would really make the platform sing at launch, but I never discount any possibilities with the vast array of characters and worlds that we can tap into across the company,&quot; Roper said.  OPINION: Where now for Nintendo? | MCV Ben Parfitt on yesterday&apos;s financial results from Nintendo:  Yes, losses have been halved  but it&apos;s still yet another year of loss. Wii U&apos;s hardware sales are lower than even the most pessimistic had predicted and Europe is in freefall for the company. Wii u has yet to sell 1m units in Europe in the five months since release and is still being outsold globally by Wii. (Compare that to sales of 37.4m for iPhone and 19.5m for iPad in the last QUARTER alone). Make no mistake about it  this is not the financial performance one would expect from a platform holder with a new console on the market and certainly not one you&apos;d expect from a company who just a few short years ago was redefining the market.  And perhaps as a result of all that... Nintendo won&apos;t hold a large E3 press conference this year | The Verge  The pre-E3 press conferences by Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo are often when the biggest gaming news of the year gets delivered, but one of the three console manufacturers is ducking out this time around. Nintendo has announced that, instead of a large-scale presentation in Los Angeles, it will hold smaller private events for media and distributors, and its E3 presence will be limited to showing off software.  This is not a huge surprise, Nintendo&apos;s last two events have been disappointingly patchy. Pikmin 3 proved the only huge excitement last year, and the year before, the company managed to confuse everyone with its Wii U &apos;is it just a controller? What is going on?!&apos; reveal. The Weblog Freeware Game Pick: An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge | IndieGames.com  I do not want to start a debate or anything, but it&apos;s so much easier to simply describe An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge as a game. So, yes, it&apos;s a game. A freeware game, to be precise, and one that will run on your average Windows machine and provide you with a semi-interactive snapshot from the US Civil War rendered in chunky, parallax scrolling pixels.  An interesting little game to try out for ten minutes in your lunch break today. You can follow Press Start at Pinboard.",

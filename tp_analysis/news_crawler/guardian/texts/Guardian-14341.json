His conclusion:   Bitcoin phishing is not new and as more and more users enter the BTC fray it&apos;s clear that it will be a bigger problem. As Twitter novelty account Bitcoin.txt notes, the market is frothy and full of folks who have little experience investing in anything, let alone an imaginary digital currency that could be part of a future economic engine  or could spell ruin for investors who click bit.ly links.  Novelty account != parody account. Don&apos;t ask court to &apos;mop up mess&apos; over patents, Apple, Google told &gt;&gt; The Seattle Times  Apple and Google&apos;s Motorola Mobility unit are more interested in using litigation as a business strategy than in resolving disputes over the use of patented technology, a federal judge in Florida said. &quot;The parties have no interest in efficiently and expeditiously resolving this dispute; they instead are using this and similar litigation worldwide as a business strategy that appears to have no end,&quot; U.S. District Judge Robert Scola in Miami said in an order dated yesterday. &quot;That is not a proper use of this court.&quot;  Motorola began by suing Apple. Apple sued back. Motorola (with Google&apos;s explicit approval) sued even more back. Apple... you get the idea. (Thanks @candidcanon on Twitter for the link.) Touchscreen to become standard specification for third-generation ultrabooks &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Intel has decided to make touchscreen functions a standard specification for its third-generation ultrabooks, which is expected to launch shortly after the release of its Haswell platform in early June, according to sources from the upstream supply chain. However, overall related costs will increase by at least US$70-80, and while Intel hopes its brand partners to offer their ultrabooks at a price level in the sweet spot of the market, the sources are concerned that the strategy will greatly shrink ODM profits, despite Intel marketing subsidies.  Digitimes etc etc. But: we&apos;re in the third generation of ultrabooks? And: they think higher assembly costs will let them sell at the same price? JPMorgan: Samsung will ship 320m smartphones this year, 80m being the S4 &gt;&gt; AndroidBeat Stefan Constantinescu:   I&apos;ve been searching high and low for an analyst prediction on the success of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S4, and today, in the French paper Les chos, I finally found one. JPMorgan says Samsung will likely ship 320m smartphones in 2013, of which 80m will be the high end Galaxy S4. Is that goal reachable? Last week I covered a DigiTimes report that said Samsung has an internal goal of hitting half a billion phone sales. If JPMorgan&apos;s estimate of 320m smartphone sales turns out to be true, that means 64% of the mobile phones Samsung will sell this year will be &quot;smart&quot;. Another analyst firm, Gartner, says 53.5% of the phones Samsung sold during 2012 were &quot;smart&quot;, so that 64% figure for 2013 does indeed sound right.  How many iPads did Apple sell last quarter? &gt;&gt; Fortune Tech  For the most recent quarter - the one that ended March 29 - the positions of the two groups are reversed, with the pros more bullish than the amateurs. The consensus among the professionals is that Apple will report Q2 sales of 18.4m iPads; the average among the indies is 17.7m.  Compares to 11.8m in the year-ago quarter. This just-gone quarter, HP shifted 12m PCs. Tablets are knocking on the door. Eighteen and Abandoned &gt;&gt; The New Yorker Matthew JX Malady (that&apos;s him):   when I recently logged into an old Yahoo e-mail account I still use for ordering flowers and entering N.C.A.A. basketball-tournament bracket contests, a message from &quot;Google Account Recovery&quot; greeted me with a cold reminder of my past e-mail-related shenanigans. It offered no salutation, cutting right to the chase: &quot;To initiate the password-reset process for your eighteen@gmail.com Google Account, click the link below.&quot; I followed the instructions and found myself in the in-box of a Gmail account that had not been checked since George W. Bush was serving his first term as President and &quot;Thefacebook&quot; was something available only to certain college kids. What I discovered was a treasure trove of bizarre and ridiculous e-mail messages.  The puzzle is how many of those apparently real emails were some subtle form of spam or phishing. September 2012: Ballmer says 400m devices will be running Windows 8 next year &gt;&gt; AllThingsD Interviewed in September 2012:   &quot;One year from now, between Windows phones, Windows tablets and Windows PCs, we&apos;ll see close to  400 million new devices running those new operating systems,&quot; Ballmer said during the unveiling of Nokia&apos;s new Lumia smartphones this morning. &quot;Those devices running Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 represent the single largest opportunity for software developers today. Four hundred million per year? That is unrivaled. I&apos;ll bet you right now, the next app developer to hit it really big will do so on Windows.&quot;  That&apos;s an average of 100m per quarter of everything. Let&apos;s see - 60m Windows 8 licences sold to January. About 7m Windows Phone sold in Q4 2012. About a million Surfaces (if you&apos;re generous) sold in Q4 2012. Some distance to make up. Computer sales in free fall &gt;&gt; WSJ.com Adding some colour to the picture about Windows 8:   Carrie Soukup, a 32-year old tech support contractor living in Austin, Texas, is among the skeptics about the new [Windows 8] software. As she has been researching a new laptop she plans to purchase this year, she said a PC running Windows 7 was more appealing than the newer designs. &quot;I&apos;m not entirely thrilled with Windows 8,&quot; she said. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of show I don&apos;t see the functionality in.&quot; Other consumers, like Gene Elmer Munson, have held off buying PCs all together as they increasingly rely on mobile gadgets. Mr. Munson, a 40-year-old human resources-and-finance worker, has a desktop, a laptop and a smartphone and 7-inch tablet powered by Google Inc.&apos;s Android software. He bought the 7-inch Google Nexus tablet in December, and now finds himself using his laptop less and his tablet more, especially for personal work, including the novels he writes in his spare time. &quot;If I didn&apos;t have a smartphone and a tablet I would have replaced it by now,&quot; said Mr. Munson of his HP laptop. &quot;I don&apos;t see myself buying a laptop in the foreseeable future.&quot;  Also has a fascinating graph showing sales growth since the iPad launched. It&apos;s pretty much a straight line down. (Subscription probably required.) Best Android phones for smaller hands &gt;&gt; TalkAndroid.com  It&apos;s pretty obvious that handset makers think the bigger the phone, the better. We&apos;ve seen phones slowly climb in screen size, up from 3.5in to 4in to 4.7in, and now even past 5in. These bigger screens are fantastic, but it&apos;s easy to see how people who prefer smaller phones may feel a little left out.  (Thanks @rquick for the link.) Appeals court likely to give German iCloud users push email back on 24th, lift Google&apos;s injunction &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents  Google&apos;s German push email injunction against Apple is presently the only injunction any &quot;Android company&quot; is presently enforcing anywhere in the world against Apple (and nothing is being enforced against Microsoft). In two weeks&apos; time, even this one will likely be history. There are people out there saying that there are wins and losses on both sides, but the fact of the matter is that the only &quot;wins&quot; the Android camp scores are non-defeats, not true wins in terms of offensive achievements.

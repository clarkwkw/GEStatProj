    "text": "The Ebaccs reintroduce a failure-by-exam system of assessment first introduced by the eugenicist Cyril Burt in the 1938 Spens committee report, source of the accursed 11-plus which blighted the lives of generations. Ebaccs aim to expand the pool of unskilled, unqualified, low-cost labour that UK plc increasingly demands as the coalition drives us back to the Victorian sweatshop. Labour sought to address low-skilled labour shortages by promoting people with learning disabilities to the reserve army of labour with its Valuing People agenda. This cross-party strategy, always flawed, now lies in tatters, and the poverty in which those with learning disabilities live will be deepened by the continued employment marginality inferred by Ebaccs. In a world dominated by the idea that education is competitive, the vulnerable always lose. Ebaccs means a more brutal society, more failure, more losers  just what the coalition wants.Dr Lee HumberThame",

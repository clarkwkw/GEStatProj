    "headline": "Greater wealth in emerging economies won't reduce inequality by itself", 
    "text": "China now has at least as many billionaires as the US, yet despite huge progress in tackling poverty, still has more than 200 million people living on less than a $1 a day. South Africa has an average per capita income that makes it a high middle-income country, yet it has 8 million people living below the same poverty line  that&apos;s 16% of its population. A comparison someone neatly made to me recently is that it is like having Niger and Switzerland in one country. At the same time the US and Europe have demonstrated just how clearly a myth it is that with greater wealth automatically comes greater equality. Far from it. We seem to be rapidly returning to Victorian levels of inequality, with the average top executive being paid 214 times the average wage by 2020. And as our new report, Left Behind by the G20 shows, unless action is taken fast, this is going to get worse in many places. International data on inequality, unlike GDP growth, has historically been very poorly collected, which itself says a lot. Fortunately this has begun to change with a new more robust database, the Solt database of standardised income inequality, on the basis of which Oxfam has made some clear predictions that make sobering reading. For instance, even if South Africa were to grow at 3.7% a year for the next five years, if its inequality continues to increase at the same rate as in recent years, there could be over 1 million more poor people by 2020. The good news is that in countries such as Brazil the trend over the last decade has been just the opposite. Brazil was once a shorthand for the most gratuitous inequalities on earth, with jacuzzis juxtaposed with favelas. It still remains an unequal place, but in the last decade it has managed to grow, become more equal, and reduce poverty at the same time. It has not done this by accident, but by design, with strong government action to implement policies that redistribute wealth and help the poorest. Investment in progressive taxation and in policies like education for all and healthcare focused on public provision is a huge asset to its population and to fighting inequality. Brazil managed to lift nearly 12 million people out of poverty between 1999 and 2009  that brings the proportion of those living in poverty from around one in nine to fewer than one in 25. Our projections show that if Brazil continues to move in this direction, poverty will reduce by more than 5 million. Conversely, if its inequality levels rise, even robust growth for the next five years will make no difference to the poor. In Mexico, accelerating the fall in inequality by taking five points off the Gini by 2020 could reduce the number of people in absolute poverty by more than three-quarters. What the Brazilian experience, and that of other countries such as Mexico and South Korea shows, is that rising inequality is in no way a given. Rising inequality is a clear result of political choice. What is now increasingly accepted is that inequality is corrosive. It can completely undermine the benefits of growth. It contributes to a broad range of social ills  from murder rates to low educational achievement. It undermines public institutions and government accountability. It is self-reinforcing, as elites act to shore up the system that created them. Moreover, a growing body of evidence demonstrates the pernicious impact of inequality on growth itself. Among other findings, recent IMF research papers have illustrated the role of inequality in driving the 2008 financial crisis, and the fact that high levels of inequality shorten the average length of periods of economic growth. The question of what can and should be done about this is harder, with different answers for different countries. Oxfam is undertaking a major research project to look at the impact of different policies on inequality and growth. But some obvious lessons stand out: progressive taxes and redistributive transfers make a huge difference; universal public services  particularly education and health  are both an income transfer and increase social mobility to reduce future inequality. A focus on inequalities between women and men is not only necessary in its own right but crucial in reducing income and wealthy inequality, and redistribution of land can reduce poverty and prevent growing inequality. As we head into a new age of scarcity  whether it be water, carbon, energy or food  a fairer distribution of these scarce resources and the policies to achieve this will increasingly have to take centre stage. Against a backdrop of greater unrest from the 99%, whether in Lagos or London, this is an issue that will be harder and harder for leaders to ignore. That said, they will certainly do their best. So far there is little evidence of G20 leaders taking this on board. The trouble is that the policies which clearly impact on inequality  like progressive taxation of the richest, regulation of markets, and free public services  remain out of favour with governing elites. G20 leaders instead rush to prop up the global economy and a deregulated financial system, and the special interests that have given them such support and retain huge influence. Witness the determined opposition of the UK to a Robin Hood tax, for example. There are exceptions: China&apos;s huge investment in a universal system of healthcare, if it goes ahead, is a big one. Nevertheless, the lack of leadership from the G20 on inequality is stark.  This article was amended on 1 February 2012. The original stated that if inequality continued to increase, there could be 8 million more poor people by 2020. This has now been changed.",

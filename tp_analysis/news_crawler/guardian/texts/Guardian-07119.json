    "text": "A quick burst of 6 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Analysts just can&apos;t get Apple right, it&apos;s too innovative &gt;&gt; Fast Company  Here are some of the most-quoted Apple analysts: Gene Munster, from Piper Jaffray has a bachelor&apos;s degree in &quot;financial managment and new venture strategies;&quot; Sean Wu has a BSc in economics; Atlantic Equities&apos; James Corwell, given five stars by Yahoo&apos;s finance page for his accuracy in predicting Apple&apos;s stock performance holds a first class degree in mathematics from Cambridge; Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford C. Bernstein has a bachelor of science in electrical engineering from Brown University; and RBC&apos;s Mike Abramsky, has an MSc in engineering from MIT.  Though these weren&apos;t the only analysts whose opinion drove Apple&apos;s &quot;rare miss&quot; headlines this quarter, a lack of high-tech, communications and scientific degrees (or training) underscores something, here. Centering on economics and finance, many analysts seem to ignore common sense and technological aspects of Apple&apos;s business that have led the company down the path of enduring success.   Note the date when this was written. Still true. November 2009: RIM stock climbs on share buyback &gt;&gt; Reuters From November 2009:   BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd announced a share buyback worth up to $1.2bn on Thursday, but analysts said competitive concerns will continue to exert pressure on the company&apos;s stock.  The stock was then at $60. The stock now is about $7, so the $1.2bn of stock is now worth about $140m. RIM threw away $1bn on its own stock using cash that it badly needs now. A classic example of why stock buybacks are always a sign of management losing its focus. The 3 Phases of Owning a Computer &gt;&gt; The Oatmeal So true. Meet the &apos;bots&apos; that edit Wikipedia &gt;&gt; BBC News To be precise, the bots that watch for vandalism. A fascinating piece. Asus, Lenovo, Toshiba, Samsung to launch Windows RT tablets this year. Others await Microsoft&apos;s permission in January &gt;&gt; Unwired View Why are there so few Windows RT tablets announced?   According to [the] Chinese Economic Times, each major Windows RT ARM chipset vendor - NVIDIA, Texas Instruments and Qualcomm - was allowed to select only two OEM partners for the original launch. NVIDIA got Lenovo and Asus, Texas Instruments chose Toshiba, and Qualcomm went with Samsung and HP. Now, that Hewlett-Packard decided not to do ARM tablet at first, Qualcomm might be working with Dell to fill the vacancy.  Apparently, this restriction will be lifted in January. Why is Microsoft looking to restrict the number of Windows RT tablet makers at launch, though? Apple&apos;s Reality-Check Quarter In Charts &gt;&gt; SplatF But the big-picture story is that this is a slower period ahead of the expected new iPhone and potential new iPad this fall (and maybe someday, a television). Apple&apos;s 23% year-over-year revenue growth was its slowest since 12% growth in the June 2009 quarter, and was almost down at Google&apos;s 21% level!

    "text": "Following a spectacular series of leaks, Sony&apos;s recent revelations about PlayStation 4 felt a bit muted. Games like Knack, a cutely enigmatic title featuring a shape-changing robot, and Watch Dogs, a game about hacking superheroics that&apos;s also due to appear on every other console, were joined by dreary-looking first-person shooter Killzone: Shadow Fall. Microsoft is rumoured to be holding its own next-gen announcement in April  This week&apos;s releases include Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance Official Strategy Guide, from the redoubtable Piggyback, the masters of making walkthroughs easy to use and lovely to look at; NBA 2K13/MLB 2K13 Combo Pack (Xbox &amp; PS3), offering basketball and baseball with a name that sounds like a list of robots; and the Tomb Raider Limited Edition Controller (Xbox), which looks as designer-bruised as Lara Croft herself might after the contusion-inducing first couple of hours of the game.",

    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view The original Wii came bundled with the iconic Wii Sports. To get Nintendo Land you&apos;ll need to opt for the Wii U Premium Pack (it&apos;s also available separately) and while it may not wield the same future shock as Wii Sports, it does the job of introducing you and up to four friends to the variety of things Wii U can do. Its mini-games include Yoshi&apos;s Fruit Cart, where Mario&apos;s little green dinosaur follows a line drawn on the touch screen to eat fruit and avoid obstacles on TV; and Donkey Kong&apos;s Crash Course, a vertical maze that you negotiate by tilting the controller, pressing buttons and blowing on the mic. Multiplayer games include Pikmin Adventure, in which the player with the gamepad leads while everyone else controls a tiny Pikmin each, and Metroid Blast. But there are low points: flicking throwing stars in Takamuru&apos;s Ninja Castle is an activity that does not stay interesting for long.",

    "text": "In the never-ending battle for democracy and civil rights, sometimes democracy loses. So it was today, with the visit by the Russian foreign minister to Damascus to shore up the murderous Assad regime, and the sudden fall of President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives. These two events are related, for Nasheed has a claim to have started the Arab Spring. The first democratically elected leader of a 100% Muslim country, he swept away the 30-year dictatorship of Maumoon Gayoom in national elections back in 2008. Now the Maldives sadly sees its spring being rolled back: a leader elected through the ballot box has just been deposed by street violence and intimidation. I doubt that Russia, China or other autocratic regimes will shed any tears for Nasheed, but those governments of the world that do value democracy and the rule of law should not be under any illusions about what has just taken place. The former dictator Gayoom and his forces never accepted the outcome of the 2008 elections, and their networks of power and influence were increasingly threatened by Nasheed&apos;s campaign against corruption in the judiciary. Indeed, this crisis was sparked by the arrest of senior court judge who had repeatedly refused to prosecute corruption cases in order to protect powerful allies from the former regime. Recently the opposition had begun to use inflammatory antisemitic and jihadi hate-speech to falsely accuse Nasheed of undermining Islam. Using violence and then taking over the TV station, as well as recruiting converts among the police, the anti-democratic opposition faced Nasheed with a choice  to either use force or resign. Ever the human rights activist, he chose the latter option and stepped down to avoid bloodshed. Even as I write, his whereabouts are still unknown, and though he is supposedly in the &quot;protection&quot; of the military I fear desperately for his personal safety and that of his family. I have heard that he is currently being held against his will under military house arrest, in which case he must be immediately released. All I can do is take comfort from the fact that the struggle can only continue for a man famous in the west for his outspokenness on climate change, but whose real lifelong cause has been his commitment to bringing democracy to his Indian Ocean island homeland. Over two decades of campaigning against the Gayoom regime, Nasheed set up the Maldivian Democratic Party in exile, and was imprisoned 16 times. He spent six years in jail, and 18 months in solitary confinement in appalling conditions, also suffering torture at the hands of Gayoom&apos;s thugs. Nasheed&apos;s resignation speech says a lot about the man: &quot;I don&apos;t want to run the country with an iron fist,&quot; he said. I can only imagine what he must be going through now, and what he has gone through already in the past. He was declared an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience in 1991. I don&apos;t think I have ever met a braver or stronger person. I was lucky enough to work for president Nasheed over the last two years, as his climate change adviser. His commitment to turning the Maldives into the world&apos;s first carbon-neutral country was typically ambitious, and  although all bets are now off  serious progress has already been made. He personally stood up to bullying by China at the ill-fated Copenhagen talks in 2009, helping secure a better deal for vulnerable island nations like his own. I do not want this to sound like Nasheed&apos;s political obituary. If I know the man at all, this coup will not be the last word. We do not yet know whether democracy and freedom of expression will be safeguarded in future in the Maldives under the new government, but if it is not, I am certain Nasheed will be at the forefront of any effort that is needed to protect these universal values. I pledge to stand with him, and I hope others will, too.",

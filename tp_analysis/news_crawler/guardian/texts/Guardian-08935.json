    "text": "It was a case of worst possible timing as BlackBerry maker Research In Motion (RIM) confirmed it had suffered a significant outage across Europe on Friday morning, just as the iPhone 5 was launching to the now familiar queues in Apple stores around the world. Vodafone customers across Europe, the Middle East and Africa experienced difficulties with BlackBerry Messenger, email and the internet for more than four hours from 8am (BST), with owner RIM admitting that difficulties with its smartphone continued until about 12.30pm. The company tweeted: &quot;Some users in Europe, Middle East and Africa are experiencing issues with their BlackBerry service.&quot; And an hour later it tweeted again: &quot;We are investigating and apologise for any inconvenience.&quot; Service was fully restored about 12.30pm, four-and-a-half hours after the BlackBerry service went down, the company said. &quot;Our apologies to any customers impacted by the BlackBerry service issue today. We can confirm that services have been restored and are now operating normally,&quot; RIM said in a statement. The glitch was only affecting Vodafone users, a RIM spokeswoman in London said. &quot;We are currently experiencing a BlackBerry service issue impacting some users in Europe, Middle East and Africa. All relevant support teams are working to resolve the issue. We apologise to any customers who may be affected.&quot; The outage was not expected to be as damaging as the one RIM suffered last year when BlackBerrys were hobbled for several days. But the timing is far from ideal as Apple continue to lap up worldwide publicity with the much-hyped launch of its iPhone 5. In a now familiar global ritual, Apple fans queued outside shops from Sydney to Tokyo to pick up the tech juggernaut&apos;s latest iPhone. Eager buyers formed long lines on Friday at Apple stores in Australia and Japan to be the first to get their hands on the latest version of the smartphone. In Hong Kong and Singapore, buyers had to sign up online for the chance to pick up the device at a prearranged time. The first customers in Hong Kong were greeted by staff cheering, clapping, and chanting &quot;iPhone 5! iPhone 5!&quot; and high-fiving them as they were escorted one-by-one through the front door. Apple&apos;s new smartphone is also being launched in the US, Britain, Canada, France and Germany. It will go on sale in 22 more countries a week later. The iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, has a taller screen, faster processor, updated software and can work on faster fourth generation mobile networks. The iPhone 5 has become a hot seller despite initial lukewarm reviews and controversy over its decision to dump Google Maps from its standard collection of pre-loaded apps and replace it with its own map app which has been criticised for losing towns, moving zoos and renaming key locations such as Paddington railway station in London. Apple received 2m orders in the first 24 hours of announcing the iPhone 5 release date, more than twice the number for the iPhone 4S in the same period when that phone launched a year ago, and analysts estimate it will ship as many as 10m by the end of September. The controversy over the decision to drop Google Maps is threatening to overshadow the launch as complaints flood in from users. Google is said to be working on a separate map app that iPhone users can download.",

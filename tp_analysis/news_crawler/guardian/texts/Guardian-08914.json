    "text": "Dorothy Wedderburn, who has died aged 87, was a social scientist with interests that came tocentre on industrial sociology. She was also a socialist, university principal, enemy of all self-advertisement and an untypical member of the community of &quot;the great and the good&quot;. Born in Walthamstow, north-east London, she was the youngest child ofFrederick Barnard, a class-conscious trade unionist carpenter and joiner, and his wife, Ethel, who had left school at 13 to earn her living in service. Both were the children of blacksmiths. Even in relatively meritocratic Britain, few 20th-century academics and administrators of distinction started life in such a working-class family. For both Dorothy and her brother George, an eventual president of the Royal Statistical Society, to graduate from Cambridge University before 1945 was yet more uncommon, though helped byschool scholarships. From an evacuated Walthamstow high school for girls, Dorothy applied to Oxford and Cambridge and was offered a place at both. In 1943 she went to Girton College, Cambridge, where she could study economics, &quot;which Iknew nothing about but which seemed relevant to my interests&quot;. Like George, she soon joined the Communist party and remained a member until sometime in the mid- or late 1950s  she claimed not to remember exactly  but never announced her resignation orchanged the basic pattern of her political activities. She remained steadily, ifsometimes sceptically, loyalto the labour movement and theleft. The prospects for academic careers were scant in those days, and Dorothy had not seriously thought of one when, married to an undergraduate contemporary, the economic historian AN &quot;Max&quot; Cole, she returned to Cambridge after a spell as temporary assistant principal, and then research officer, at the Board of Trade (1946-50). A perceptive economist suggested she should supervise undergraduates, and she joined Richard Stone&apos;s department of applied economics, where she stayed for the next 15 years as research officer, and later senior research officer. She never took a research degree. Her interests shifted from economics to social policy  on which she began to lecture at Cambridge  and, after work on poverty, redundancy and old age, with a number of books in the 1960s, toindustrial sociology. She was awarded honorary doctorates by Cambridge and six other universities, and maintained her friendships and connections with Cambridge, particularly with Darwin College, to the end. In 1962, two years after her first marriage ended in divorce, Dorothy married the labour lawyer Bill, later Lord, Wedderburn. When he moved from Cambridge to a chair at the LSE, she considered but rejected a post there in favour of one in the engineering department at Imperial College London, with more scope for her interest in the influence of technology on work organisation. She rose from lecturer to professor ofindustrial sociology (1977-81) and head of the department of economic and social studies. As a member of &quot;the great and the good&quot;, she chaired an inquiry into women&apos;s prisons and sat on research councils, on the Committee on the Pay and Conditions of Nurses, on the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth (strangled by the incoming prime minister, Margaret Thatcher), and on the council ofAcas, the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which survived even the iron lady. Until 2004 she served on the board of the Anglo-German Foundation. Though indifferent to showmanship, Dorothy found herself to be an academic grandee  a member ofadvisory committees and governing bodies. In 1980 she was elected principal ofBedford College, University ofLondon, retaining her link with Imperial as senior research fellow (1981-2003). She supervised the difficult but necessary merger of the oldest of British women&apos;s colleges with another Victorian foundation for female higher education into Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, University of London in 1986. Six years later its name was shortened to Royal Holloway, University of London. She remained its principal until 1990, quietly refusing the title usually offered insuchcases. But she did not disdain the honorary presidency of the Fawcett Society (1986-2002), campaigning for gender equality. Why Labour governments made so little use of a social policy expert so deeply committed to the labour movement puzzled many. In the 1960s she may have been considered too radical. In the era of Tony Blair, Downing Street had no enthusiasm for politically unreliable academic intellectuals. Though she had more than one close partner, Dorothy did not remarry after her second divorce, in 1968. She acted as a matriarch of the Barnard clan, radiating intelligence, warmth and trust. Active holidays in Denmark, Wales and Norfolk became increasingly difficult. She bore strokes from 2006 and the loss of her sight in 2010 with grace and the help of family, loyal friends and music. A notably attractive woman, Dorothy continued to take her appearance seriously. At the lunch with which Royal Holloway celebrated her 80th birthday, she reserved a table for the staff of her Knightsbridge hairdressers. She never ceased to enjoy the recreations which she described in Who&apos;s Who as politics and cooking. For her survivors, her greatest gift was friendship.  Dorothy Enid Cole Wedderburn, sociologist, born 18 September 1925; died20 September 2012",

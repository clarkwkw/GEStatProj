    "text": "No other zombie game is quite as meta-fictional as Dead Island: Riptide. While others are content to merely feature the shambling undead, here is a title that resurrects its first outing wholesale. And, just like a corpse left to rot in the sun, Riptide itself is something you probably don&apos;t want to spend too long around. Apart from a new player character and a handful of fresh weapons, there&apos;s nothing new here. Offering another tropical paradise infested with flesh-hungry ghouls, more impromptu item-crafting, and fetch-quest after fetch-quest, Riptide&apos;s monotony is alleviated only by the fun of teaming up with friends to zombie hunt as a unit  although disappointingly much of that fun will come from laughing at in-game glitches.",

    "text": "If youre a video game fan of a certain age, you may remember Edge magazines controversial review of the bloody sci-fi shooting game, Doom. Perhaps you enjoyed a good laugh, as many first-person shooter fans have, at the writers much-mocked assertion: if only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances  Now that would be interesting. Of course, we all know what happened. There would be no room in the Doom series, nor any subsequent first-person blast-em-up, for such socio-psychological niceties. Instead, we enjoyed 20 years of shooting, bludgeoning and stabbing, the ludicrous idea of diplomacy cast roughly aside.  But during this era, something else was happening in game design, and in academic thinking around video games and artificial intelligence. Buoyed by advances in AI research and aided by increasingly powerful computer processors, developers were beginning to think about the possibilities of non-player characters (NPCs) who could think and act in a more complex and human way  who could provide the emotional feedback that the Edge reviewer was thinking about.            Arguably, this quest began in 1985 when Activision released a strange game entitled Little Computer People. Co-created by veteran designer David Crane, players had to care for the randomly generated inhabitant of a suburban home. The character had a limited range of emotions and behaviours, and player interaction ranged from feeding the character, to offering gifts and entering simple commands. This virtual pet concept would later find more complex treatment in the Tamagotchi phenomenon and in the artificial life sim, Creatures.  But the most notable continuation was Will Wrights virtual soap opera The Sims. Released in 2000 it provided a household of intelligent characters who would form relationships and develop behaviours that  enhanced by the imagination of players  suggested emotional depth and authenticity. Doubted by many within EA at the time, The Sims was a smash hit, and the continuing franchise has now sold over 175m copies. It was clear that players were interested in the idea of characters  or more accurately AI agents  who offered something more than digital bodies to be annihilated.  Some of the most interesting advances, however, have come from the independent sector, often fuelled by university research into AI concepts such as neural networks, machine learning and natural language processing. The 2005 game Facade by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern, for example, is an interactive domestic drama featuring a couple named Grace and Trip who are in the midst of an argument that may end their relationship. Taking on the role of a mutual friend, the player is able to talk to the couple using text inputs, making suggestions that the AI characters are able to process and understand via a range of interconnected AI technologies. These include a language processing system, which recognises the words the player uses and interprets the context, a behaviour engine that Mateas and Stern called A Behaviour Language (ABL) that controls the actions and movements of the characters, and a drama manager, which creates interesting beats and moments of tension in the emerging narrative.  Its amazing, the scarcity of satisfying interactive experiences that are actually about peoples lives  subject matter that is, of course, the heart of the best literature, cinema, theatre and television, said Stern at the time. We gave Grace and Trip a wealth of problems and hidden motivations leading to the present moment, carefully balanced between them.             The resulting scenes dont always work  they can be stilted and strange, the AI system struggling to understand the nuances of human relationships  but there are moments of emotional intensity in each playthrough, the computer-controlled couple struggling to keep their relationship alive. It was a fascinating experiment. Seven years after Facade, a group of developers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, released a game named Prom Week, a social simulation following a group of students as they prepared for their school dance. Game designer Aaron Reed was co-creator and lead writer on the project. Each character in the game is a unique AI agent driven by several thousand rules encoding the social norms and behaviours you might see in a cheesy high school comedy film, he explains. Characters would consider these rules, along with a large database of shared knowledge, such as their histories together, likes and dislikes, personality traits and recent moods, to decide what to do and how to respond to actions from other characters. The system adds drama by providing each agent with a set of characteristics following high school movie conventions (goths, jocks, princesses) and a range of emotional states. They also view each of their peers based on varying levels of three different aspects: friendship, romance and how cool the other person is. The players role involves clicking on any two characters then choosing a style of interaction between them. You then sit back and watch the social physics play out as friendships blossom and crumble amid competing interpersonal ambitions. AI characters may hate a character theyre also romantically interested in, or try to form friendships with others who dont view them as cool. Its the whole school experience in one interactive experiment. Like Facade, Prom Week features a built-in drama manager, a sort of intelligent AI system that reads and shapes the second-by-second social data. When a character takes an action  like breaking up with another student, for example  the game has a large library of scene templates that can be inserted into the moment to narrate the change in the social state. In this example, the system would search for a break up scene template, modify the dialogue for the particular characters and circumstance and then put it on screen to provide a reason and background for the relationship collapse. This effectively gives the underlying social AI system a narrator who can find the right scene to let the characters explain whats happening to them, says Reed. The system was highly effective at creating characters that felt very specific and interesting while still being driven by an emergent, dynamic social AI system.     Prom Week: a familiar tale of high school romance, bullying and friendship. Photograph: UCSC    Importantly, the mix of dynamic social AI systems and scene templates led to an array of convincing procedural behaviours that usually made sense. One of the most delightful parts of development for me was seeing the system start to perform the characters correctly, even without having any dialogue written for a specific student, says Reed. As the game came together, we would start to see emergent story moments that no one had specifically written, but were inevitable consequences of the social rules and cast of characters wed created. It was a bit like watching trained actors start venturing into improv, and coming up with wonderful scenes on their own that were true to their character and appropriate to the play. Two years later, in 2013, AI coder Richard Evans and narrative designer Emily Short worked together to develop Versu, an AI engine that could create interactive text-based stories based around intelligent and emotional characters. They began to demo the platform with a series of text-based adventures that resembled interactive Jane Austen or Agatha Christie novels, filled with intrigue and disparate characters. Here, instead of coding a small number of set personality traits for each AI agent, everyone had their own beliefs, abilities and parameters which, in theory, lead to an infinite range of habits and quirky behaviours.      Versu presents players with a selection of living stories that work like live choose your own adventure novels Photograph: Versu    Each character also has a set of interpersonal attitudes, says Evans. These are fine-grained role-evaluations: an evaluation of how well a character is performing a role. So, for example, Mrs Quinn may think that Brown lacks good breeding because he slurped his soup. Or Brown may think that Mrs Quinn lacks a sense of humour because she failed to laugh at his joke. These interpersonal attitudes can be transformed during the course of the game, and can be communicated from what one character to another, via a form of gossip. Characters also have an emotional state  based on Paul Ekmans typology of emotions. So, for example, Mrs Quinn may be annoyed because Brown was flirting with Lucy. Each character keeps track of her emotional state, the person who the emotion is directed towards, and the explanation of the emotional state or the experience that prompted the emotion. The problem though, was in communicating to players just how complex these behaviours were. When Evans and Short released the first game based on their platform, the iOS adventure Blood and Laurels, players thought it was just a standard scripted choose-your-own-adventure text game  they didnt realise that the emerging rivalries between characters were happening through AI. Evans admits that even he was blindsided by his system at times. There was one time I was playing a murder mystery game we had designed  and there was this doctor who came to diagnose how a character was murdered, he says. However, the doctor was being very rude to my character and kept making dismissive remarks. Initially I thought it was a bug because I knew the doctors personality was mostly pleasant, and I knew I hadnt been rude to him. I thought, oh man, why is he being such an arsehole to me?  I looked through the code and it turned out that much much earlier in the game Id been rude to a servant during dinner, and the servant had gone into the kitchen and told the people there what a jerk Id been  one of those people was the doctor. He remembered that. This took me quite a long time to debug. This is an example of how emergence is exciting but it opens up questions about game design.  Its an interesting problem. In 2011 a group of researchers at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain created a program named the Emotional Elicitation Process, that could define and produce emotional reactions in video game characters. The team used the role-playing fantasy game Neverwinter Nights to exhibit the project, imbuing NPCs with a range of emotions. Party members could fall in love and might disregard their own safety to save someone they liked, for instance, recalls AI researcher Michael Cook. Its tricky to design for, though, because on the face of it it looks like stupid behaviour. Like a lot of new AI ideas, communicating it to the player is really crucial. Do game characters need emotions? Games such as Prom Week, Facade and The Sims were built around AI systems that created their own stories on the fly, featuring human interactions that resembled simple soap operas. But while these games proved a perfect testbed for creative and emotional AI agents, the commercial industry has had no immediate use for these fascinating innovations. In most games, AI is about controlling and directing non-player characters to provide a certain level of challenge to the player. In a shooter or strategy game, you want characters who can avoid danger areas and work to flank the player, and the major challenge is writing an effective AI pathfinding system  a means for the character to navigate the games environment. In short, theres no need for emotion or creativity when all youre required to do is provide a target for the player while not bumping into the furniture.  I think the rise of emotionally intelligent game characters has been hampered by two major factors, says Reed. One is the difficulty of developing and using the technology, and the other is the lack of a proven track record to inspire game producers to tackle that challenge. Its a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: unlike other aspects of AI such as pathfinding, there arent established algorithms and architectures for [emotional] character AI, which means a lot of difficult original research and experimentation on a pretty big scale: precisely the sort of thing thats out of reach for most indies or academics, but tends to get cut in big-budget titles as a risky, unknown factor. But while the mainstream games industry was overlooking emotional character design and emergent behaviours, the concept of computational creativity was becoming a major element of artificial intelligence research. From the 1980s, the idea that AI systems could learn to think like humans and devise their own narrative, artistic or linguistic works began to intrigue both universities and major technology companies. This has led to developments like IBMs intelligent computer cook that invents its own recipes, and the What If Machine created by a group of European universities, which answers hypothetical what if questions submitted by users. It also led to ANGELINA, a computer program developed by Michael Cook that can write its own simple video games, sourcing graphics and concepts by browsing internet search engines. A lot of these theories and methodologies are now feeding contemporary academic research into games and emotional AI agents. Mark Riedl is associate professor at Georgia Tech and director of the universitys Entertainment Intelligence Lab. Hes currently working on a project named Quixote, an AI system designed to make it easier for non-specialist programmers to create intelligent virtual agents. Quixote allows AI agents to learn social rules and behaviours through reading stories sourced online; right now Riedl uses Amazons online crowdsourcing marketplace Mechanical Turk to commission people to write short stories around set themes. To demonstrate the concept, Riedl developed a game called Robbery World in which an AI agent has to rob a bank: it studies a series of bank robbery stories submitted on Mechanical Turk; learns the common elements (travel to bank, go to counter, pull out gun, demand cash) and is then rewarded for carrying out any action that advances the plot. Were looking at how to create complicated virtual characters for games and social simulations, says Reidl. The idea is that humans can tell (or crowd-source) stories about how to behave and the AI will train the characters from those stories. I think it would be especially useful in populating role-playing games with virtual characters  its a very different use of AI and a different way of thinking about how to use storytelling. We are currently integrating Quixote with Minecraft.     In the Restaurant Game the AI waitress had learned how to behave by watching hundreds of humans play through the game in her role Photograph: MIT    Riedl, then, envisions a new era of AI game characters that can research and learn from human stories or actions in a game world and thereby work out how to act like humans; imagine a Witcher character who observes how you play, almost like listening to your stories round the campfire as you save your game, and then remembers the morals of those stories the next time they appear by your side in battle. This process of teaching behaviours to machine learning algorithms is going to be of huge importance in the coming years and its implications stretch far beyond games. AI research is obviously also being applied to robotics  ineed Riedl and fellow researchers at Georgia Tech are looking at how Quixote could be used to teach robots how to behave in a socially and morally acceptable manner.  The Entertainment Intelligence Lab isnt the only place working towards this idea of AI agents learning from people. Ten years ago, Jeff Orkins fascinating Restaurant Game got players to take on the role of a customer going out for a meal, with the waitress controlled by an AI. However in preparation for this simulation, he asked thousands of volunteers to play the game as the waitress, while the AI watched and learned from their actions. The resulting agent was able to cope with a vast range of player actions and behaviours. This is where things lead in an interesting new direction. In 2013, Orkin co-founded GiantOtter Technologies, a tech company thats now taking the idea of human-trained agents and designing advanced conversational AI to power a new generation of human-like chatbots. This is a sector that companies like Facebook, IBM, Google, Apple and Amazon are very interested in, envisioning the use of AI bots in customer relations, tech support and staff training. Reidl is working in this arena too, designing what he calls interactive improvisational storytelling chatbots.  Intelligent chatbots are a big deal in technology right now  we all watched with horror and amusement when Microsoft released its own bot named Tay onto Twitter earlier this year, only for it to quickly learn racist, sexist behaviours. Both Riedl and Orkin see connections between the idea of chatbot that can converse freely and imaginatively with users and an AI game character who can do the same. Indeed, the fascinating 2014 game The Suspect used IBMs Watson technology, designed to help coders create convincing humanlike chatbots, to create a police interrogation thriller in which the eponymous suspect is played by the chatbot technology. But while we can understand why big companies like Amazon might want human-like chatbots to provide customer services, the reasoning isnt so clear for games. Scripted narrative titles such as Mass Effect and Witcher 3 already provide characters and stories that we relate to and feel for. Is it necessary to add the complexity of AI systems that think for themselves and potentially make idiosyncratic decisions based on data not immediately obvious to the player? What will that add? You perhaps have to think about where games are going. Over the last five years weve seen a huge design shift away from linear narrative adventures and toward open-world games with procedurally generated landscapes and the capacity for emergent stories. In many ways whats missing from the highly naturalistic worlds of Grand Theft Auto and Witcher is characters that have their own agendas and internal lives  that can provide on-the-fly challenges for the player, or just register your existence in the game world. In the action adventure title Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, critics and players reacted very positively to the games Nemesis system, which allowed computer-controlled enemies to remember fights theyd had with the player and bring these up in later encounters.  It wasnt a particularly sophisticated AI system, but it added a sense of permanence and agency to the game  it made you feel part of a functioning social world. In a similar way, Ubisofts sci-fi action game Watch Dogs let users hack into the phones of passers-by and learn about their lives  a practice that would often kickstart little emergent missions, and drew civilians into the story.      Bad News  by James Ryan, Ben Samuel, and Adam Summerville  is a game that uses human actors whose characterisations are governed by an AI program Photograph: James Ryan    What mainstream game developers may need is a third-party AI engine that produces interesting characters for them, without all the expensive research and development. Those solutions are emerging. James Ryan is a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz, working in the Expressive Intelligence Studio. He and his collaborators are working on Talk of the Town, an AI platform that creates interactive experiences featuring intelligent characters who have ongoing personalities encompassing emotions, beliefs, memories and relationships. There are two core AI problems that Talk of the Town is tackling, says Ryan. How do you support autonomous characters who have ongoing subjective experience of the game world, and how do you support unconstrained conversational interaction between player and NPCs? We have systems that decide how people go about their daily routines, and how the various subjective phenomena should be triggered over the course of a characters day  things like forming, propagating, misremembering knowledge or memories, and forming or evolving relationships. Ryan and his collaborators are using three AI elements to power their platform: a dialogue manager to handle conversational flow between characters; a natural language generation (NLG) system that takes the dialogue managers decision about how the NPC should respond (structured as a content request) and generates a line of dialogue that performs accordingly; and a natural language understanding (NLU) system being developed in collaboration with Adam Summerville  the most complex element. It takes in free-text input and converts the players utterance to a form that tells the dialogue manager how the world should be changed and how the NPC should respond, says Ryan. Here, were using neural networks  specifically, the LSTM architecture thats all the rage right now. To illustrate the platform Ryan and his collaborators are writing a series of their own small games. In Juke Joint, a collaboration with Tyler Brothers, the player controls a juke box in a bar crowded with AI characters  the songs you play have a direct affect on the emotions and conversations of the characters allowing you to direct the scene. National Pastime has the player entering a series of towns, interacting with locals and looking to scout baseball players. His experiments are populated by fallible, forgetful characters who exchange information skews through the Chinese Whisper effect of human gossip. It would be a remarkable system in a role-playing game where local myths, rumours and prejudices could cloud a player characters mission. [Ryan is] modelling the inner monologues of these AI characters, their thoughts, their emotional states, what they remember, what theyve forgotten, says Michael Cook. These are all the complicated human qualities that people value in each other, and that we rarely associate with AI. In James other game, Bad News, the same AI characters have their memories modelled, so they can see things, forget they saw them, misremember them and overhear someone telling someone else what they remember  or misremember. James seems very interested in these human qualities and giving AI the power to understand them. Hes one of the coolest games researchers out there at the moment.  Does Ryan see an era in which an AI platform like his could be integrated into a mainstream game? Absolutely! he says. Thats the dream, there are several of us working very hard to make it come true  Richard Evans and Emily Short included.      Could a future version of Grand Theft Auto feature a city populated by intelligent characters with their own biographies and emotions? Photograph: Rockstar    A major hold-up has been memory issues. GTA cant even keep a car in memory after its left the players field of view, so theres been no room at all for maintaining something resembling a characters inner world. This is all changing of course, and I think that expanded memory resources could be the boon that makes the next generation of emotional AI not just possible (which it already is), but practical. Another name to look out for in this sector is Mobius AI. Founded in 2015 by a team of video game veterans and AI researchers, including Aaron Reed, the company is developing an AI platform specifically for the mainstream games industry. Were working on a project to provide game developers with a social AI engine that can power game characters with greater knowledge about the world and the ability to react and perform in dynamic situations, which has never been available before in a complete package like this, says Reed. In the same way game technologies like SpeedTree or PhysX let devs plug in an engine for vegetation or physics, we want to provide an engine for social AI that lets game makers focus on creating interesting characters rather than worry about the tech that drives them.   The details of what were working on are still under wraps, but one bit of wisdom were bringing from our previous projects is that social AI is a different animal from many computer science problems that can be solved by just a better algorithm. Much like the way the brain seems to work, the best solutions seem to involve many small little systems working together to give rise to intelligent-seeming emergent behavior. Imagine a version of Grand Theft Auto, then, in which the missions dont just come from a central authored narrative  they also emerge from the ambitions and conversations of the civilians who usually just dumbly wander the world. What if two ambitious characters with low morality scores meet in a cafe and concoct a plan for a bank robbery. What if they realise they need a good driver, and recruit the player? But imagine their plans were overheard by another AI who decides to foil the plan? These complex systems of ambition and interaction could create totally new forms of game structure. Some action games may even move away from violence altogether. With natural dialogue systems were heading into an era where players could negotiate with computer-controlled characters, where persuasion, seduction and intrigue replace guns and aggression. The recent science fiction adventure Event(o) features the player character interacting with a spaceships onboard computer in order to convince the machine to plot a course back to Earth. The computer has a range of emotional states and the player has to figure out how to read these and respond to them correctly. At the moment, the premise of conversing with an intelligent computer makes sense because the conversation can be presented to the player through a text interface without it ruining the immersion of the game. The challenge for mainstream titles is to create AI characters that can actually voice their thoughts and feelings, rather than simply display them as text. But that technology is coming: DeepMind recently announced WaveNet, a tool that generates highly convincing human speech. If this were built into a game with natural language capabilities, then simple yet totally emergent conversational interactions could be verbalised by an agent. Were maybe not far from AI characters who can literally speak their minds  even though those minds may never be that sophisticated. The age of character adventures Whatever the technicalities, Reed feels that with more complex emotional AI systems well start to see new types of games  romantic comedies, character studies, coming-of-age stories  augmenting rather than replacing the sorts of experiences we now enjoy. As we start giving more control to social simulations, we can at first expect to see richer, more intriguing versions of the types of characters we have now, says Reed. Shopkeepers who can carry on a more dynamic conversation, quest-givers or lore-spouters who can answer questions or respond to your specific circumstances, and so on. But as your system gets smarter and youre willing to give it more control, it really starts suggesting entirely new genres of game that dont yet exist. Part of the reason you dont see many character-focused games right now is that games arent yet really *about* character interaction: theyre about moving through environments, defeating enemies, jumping over gaps, and so on. Once weve got the tech to make characters playable, those stories become possible to tell in interactive form: but through a profoundly different lens.  If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances... Now that would be interesting. Perhaps not in the context of Doom (there will always be games that are just about shooting and having fun  and thats fine), but in totally new gaming paradigms. Surely it will be more meaningful, more emotionally resonant if your seduction of Yennifer in Witcher 3 or Garrus in Mass Effect came, not through a scripted tree of pre-packaged conversations, but through a dynamic relationship? One things for sure, we would certainly find out more about those other characters. As Reed puts it: In much the same way that playing with a simulation of fire or fluid dynamics can lead you to deeper understanding or quicker insights than simply reading about them, truly interactive characters potentially let us have a more immediate and intuitive kind of relationship with them than with characters in linear stories. And that is really exciting.",

    "text": "David Willetts recently wrote that &quot;evidence should be the bread and butter of policy makers&quot; in an article published on this network. Unfortunately his call for evidence-based policy is undermined by the lack of evidence supporting his own government&apos;s higher education reforms. The coalition&apos;s university policies have consistently neglected both evidence and research over the past two and a half years. Willetts wrote of the importance of putting &quot;more research in the hands of decision makers&quot; in order to improve policy. However, current higher education reforms have not been based on the thorough research that underpinned previous major changes to higher education policy. In his article, Willetts discussed the landmark 1963 Robbins report on higher education. The comparison is an extremely unfavourable one. That major review of higher education suggested long-term principles and policies for how universities should be organised and funded. The Robbins committee examined foreign systems and presented six additional annexes of evidence alongside the report. Similarly, the 1997 Dearing report had five appendices of specifically commissioned research. By contrast, the Browne review (from which the coalition&apos;s reforms evolved) proposed major change on the basis of minimal evidence, only five pages of references. In fact, the one piece of research commissioned specifically for the Browne review was ignored in the final report. In supporting the introduction of for-profit-providers into the higher education sector, the government ignored the warning signs from the USA. Those private universities do not have a good track record: the most recent US Senate report makes for grim reading. Of the million students enrolled with for-profit companies in 2008-9, over half had withdrawn by 2010. In the companies studied, 22.7% of revenue was spent on marketing/advertising, 19.4% went on pre-tax profit while a mere 17.2% was spent on teaching. Despite such a poor record, the 2011 white paper was full of praise for the benefits of competition and the need to encourage more for-profit providers to enter the system. The thrust of the government&apos;s reforms, supposedly putting students at the heart of the system&apos;, addresses the wrong problems if the aim is to improve teaching. The neglect of teaching for the past 25 years has resulted from both government cuts to university funding and government-created incentives for universities to allocate their funds to research. This government has not addressed those issues but instead opted to rely on greater competition as the solution to higher education&apos;s problems. The coalition&apos;s reforms have failed to address key issues related to social mobility. Again the problems derive from ignoring both evidence and research. LSE economist Nicholas Barr, actually a leading advocate of reforming higher education towards a less state-funded system, described the abolition of the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) as &apos;unspeakable&apos;. This view was recently echoed by Alan Milburn, the coalition&apos;s child poverty adviser. EMA has been widely regarded as an extremely effective policy. Its removal will result in lost access to higher education by those who could have benefited from it. Perhaps the worst failures on evidence were those relating to the finances of higher education. The government clearly had no idea about its costs. It claimed initially that 9000 a year would only be charged in &apos;exceptional&apos; circumstances. The fact that universities have faced a mantra of &apos;more for less&apos; since the early 1970s, with ever greater output expected off the back of stagnating state investment, was ignored. Soon after that claim, two-thirds of universities announced their intention to charge 9000 a year. The government then resorted to creating the complicated core and margin bidding system for student places, yet another development that threatens universities with the worst of both state control and market chaos. Most absurdly, reforms that were presented as part of the austerity drive, actually risk increasing overall state spending levels, as the recent Higher Education Policy Institute report and subsequent &apos;unishambles&apos; headlines discussed. According to the Intergenerational Foundation (IF), the evidence suggests &quot;there is likely to be no saving to the public sector finances from the reforms to higher education funding&quot;. As student loan repayments form part of the consumer price index (CPI) inflation calculation, the rising tuition fees will force CPI inflation up. Certain government pensions and benefits are linked to the CPI. The IF estimate that this could add 2.2bn to the social security budget by 2016. While the state will save by spending less on tuition fees, the rise in the benefit bill could outweigh this saving. The student loan book also threatens to become a dangerous liability for the state. The government&apos;s figures are based on optimistic default estimates of only 30-32% losses. The IF argued that a 40% level is more likely and should be adopted. The student loan book could become a serious liability in a similar manner to PFI deals, except on a far larger scale. Willetts should not talk about evidence-based policy. His higher education reforms reflect a triumph of both incompetence and ideology over research.

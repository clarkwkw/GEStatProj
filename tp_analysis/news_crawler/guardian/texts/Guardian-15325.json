    "text": "Dozens of executives at Sony have agreed to forgo bonuses worth an estimated 1bn (6.6m) after failing to return the firm&apos;s ailing consumer electronics division to profit. The decision means the 40 executives will face pay cuts of up to 40%. While executives in the electronics division gave up their bonuses last year, this is the first time that senior management in the group, including chief executive Kazuo Hirai, have had to atone financially for the firm&apos;s poor performance in a key market. In the latest of a series of drastic cost-cutting measures, Sony recently cut 10,000 jobs in Japan and overseas  about 6% of its workforce  and halved TV production targets. It also sold off the group&apos;s headquarters in New York for more than $1bn (642m) and its Sony City Osaki premises in Tokyo. The salary reductions are an embarrassment for Hirai, who last year promised to bring the firm&apos;s electronics division back into profit. But the division has stayed in the red amid slumping sales of its PCs, games consoles and flat-screen TVs. Faced with increasing competition from rivals in South Korea and Taiwan, Sony&apos;s TV sales failed to turn a profit last year for a ninth consecutive year. Hirai and his predecessor, Sir Howard Stringer, gave up their bonuses in 2011 and agreed to base salary cuts after the company had sustained record net losses the previous year of 457bn. Despite its consumer electronics woes, Sony said it expects to show a net profit of 40bn for 2012, its first profit for five years and double its February forecast. The group&apos;s performance has improved in recent months amid a sharp fall in the value of the yen and a rise in the Japanese stock market.",

    "text": "It&apos;s the second in our now-weekly Apps Rush posts, which have been split between iOS and Android (today&apos;s Android version can be found here). Both offer a selection of the 10 most interesting new apps from the last week for their respective platforms, focusing on non-game apps a separate post on the Guardian&apos;s Games Blog will offer a weekly 10 Best selection for all smartphones and tablets. On with today&apos;s selection for iPhone and iPad: WWE American wrestling body the WWE has launched an impressive app offering a mixture of news, videos and photos, with the videos split between new clips and archive material. However, it&apos;s innovation is in its second-screen features, designed to be used while watching the WWE&apos;s weekly TV shows.iPhone / iPad Royal Mail Smilers Why should gold medal-winning Olympians have all the fun when it comes to appearing on British stamps? The Royal Mail&apos;s Smilers service has a brand new app from developer Intelligent AR, helping people turn their iPhone or iPad photos into First Class stamps. The link above is for iPhone, but here&apos;s the iPad version.iPhone / iPad Fleksy Android has had all the fun when it comes to innovative keyboard apps, due to Apple&apos;s stricter rules on developers taking over the native iOS keyboard. Fleksy is very interesting though: a predictive texting app designed for blind and visually impaired people, but attracting rave reviews from a wider range of reviewers for its smartness.iPhone Fairy Magic Startup Inlifesize has pulled in some top-tier film and games talent for this augmented reality app aimed at children. It gets them to hunt for beautifully-animated fairies in their local surroundings, with more than 50 to collect and play with.iPhone / iPad Seven Poets Edmund Pevensey is the latest developer experimenting with interactive fiction in an app. This is a &quot;real-time, serialised story&quot; with new chapters due to be released every week, starting on 15 August and running into October. There&apos;s even a fictional newspaper from the story&apos;s world that delivers new articles every day, in between the arrival of chapters.iPhone / iPad Salon.com Good news for fans of news and entertainment site Salon.com: there&apos;s now an app for that. In its current incarnation, it pulls in articles from the site, as well as images and video, and provides sharing features for Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. More features are promised regularly.iPhone Vodio Lots of startups are trying to sell the merits of social video discovery apps, even if evidence is still relatively slight on whether there&apos;s a big demand as opposed to people simply watching videos from within apps like Facebook and Twitter. Still, Vodio looks slick, tracking videos and sorting them into categories, while learning from your habits and your social graph to serve up more relevant suggestions. It&apos;s new on iPhone, although it&apos;s been out on iPad for a while.iPhone CityBeats Having nicked the Premier League in the final minute last season, now Manchester City have designs on the world of music apps. CityBeats is a club-branded remix app from Bounce Mobile promising to showcase &quot;the great up and coming bands from around the UK&quot;, while enabling you to make them sound even more (or less) up and coming by messing about with their beats and melodies.iPhone / iPad Talking Ginger Expect lots of children to be getting very excited about Talking Ginger, the latest in Outfit7&apos;s Talking Friends series 400m downloads and 115m monthly active users at the time of writing  and a virtual nephew for the equally-virtual Talking Tom Cat. Kids can interact with Ginger by tapping and talking, while guiding him through his bedtime routine (showering, teeth brushing and having a poo, rather than slaughtering a mouse on the living-room rug like most cats I know).iPhone AppFlow App-discovery app AppFlow has been a hit on Windows Phone, but now it&apos;s venturing onto iOS, where there&apos;s considerably more competition. The idea: &quot;discovering apps in a social way&quot; through recommendations from other users, while creating your own curated &quot;App Lists&quot; for other people to browse. iPhone That&apos;s this week selection, but what new apps have you been enjoying on iOS in the last week?

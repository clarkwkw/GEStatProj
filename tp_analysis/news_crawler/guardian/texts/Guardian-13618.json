    "text": "It&apos;s official  the UK has no coherent innovation policy, according to the cross-party House of Commons science and technology committee, in the latest report to describe the UK&apos;s lacklustre relationship with cash-hungry hi-tech ventures. This is bad news as technological innovation generates significant social benefits, and ultimately (but often quite slowly) economic growth. From carbon fibre, to monoclonal antibodies, to graphene, the story of valuable ideas born in the UK but developed faster abroad is all too familiar. Recently, hi-tech entrepreneurs have brought new attention to their plight by branding the financing gauntlet &quot;the valley of death&quot;. The term refers to the notion that finding money to commercialise innovative technology businesses is more difficult than they might like, with apparently deserving projects failing to attract backing. A commonly held view is that these ventures rely on university research that is developed and launched on commercial markets through a pipeline-like innovation process which, in the case of the UK, leaks like a sieve. This benefits entrepreneurs in the US and other countries who are ready and waiting to put the enthusiasm and capital into these projects that the City of London can&apos;t or won&apos;t support. Helpfully, the Commons science and technology committee pours 60 pages of scorn on this and other simplistic views of technological innovation. Innovations don&apos;t just come from universities. There isn&apos;t a valley of death, and no easy bridge over it either. The bad news, they report, is that instead there are lots of pitfalls for those seeking to commercialise research in fields such as IT, life sciences or engineering. The committee took evidence from about a hundred lobby groups, universities, firms and individuals with expertise and interests in UK science and technology (see full list here). This blog is too short to rehearse most of the arguments made, many of which are frustratingly familiar, such as blaming the inexperience of universities in commercially exploiting research (it is, after all, called &quot;the third mission&quot;  not the first or second which, lest we forget, are teaching and research), a lack of world class facilities to go with world class science, or the fact that many hi-tech firms are not run well enough to be good investments. (See this BVCA research report.) Crucially, the committee&apos;s report recognises the multifaceted nature of the problem and notes that without a coherent innovation policy to address many distinct problems, the UK will continue to miss out on its own opportunities. However, as the UK teeters on the brink of a triple-dip recession it is worth exploring the latest thinking on the financing of innovation in more depth. So where might investment for innovation come from? Although the government spends 4.6bn annually on science, most new investment in science and technology comes from established firms. However, these are often cognitively biased by their existing way of doing business, so miss new opportunities. Where they do invest, plans to reform tax credits on research and development may help R&amp;D spending a go little further but when start-ups associated with promising new technologies (think Apple and Microsoft rather than IBM, with the emergence of PCs) such tax credits won&apos;t stretch far. Perhaps sympathetic customers from government departments will pay a premium for novel ideas that can be found through new procurement schemes that are inclusive of SMEs? Certainly there is a long history of this in the US, and there is political will to expand the very modest level of such schemes in the UK. Hopefully the risk of wasting taxpayers&apos; money on small, potentially innovative but inexperienced firms not fulfilling their small contracts won&apos;t hold much fear for ministers after the huge amounts lost on huge contracts with established firms on, for example, Department of Health procurement of IT systems, but this remains to be seen. Money might be borrowed for new technology-based ventures from commercial lenders, perhaps leveraged by the proposed state-supported &quot;Bank for Business&quot;. The UK might learn from Germany and the US how bond markets can be encouraged to support smaller firms. Where private investments are lacking due to perceptions of low financial returns, such &quot;market failure&quot; can be addressed by government grants, although this still raises the spectre of &quot;picking winners&quot;  a taboo since civil servants made heavy bets on projects such as the Anglo-French Concorde, which was technically advanced but could only be sold to the UK and French state-owned airlines. Of course, picking winners is often seen as the domain of private sector investors such as venture capitalists but there are signs that government-backed bodies can do this too. An expanded Technology Strategy Board may be given more licence to do this in the future. Mariana Mazzucato, writing in a Harvard Business Review blogpost, says the US federal government doesn&apos;t mind placing such bets and that some of these have paid off handsomely in the long run. Perhaps the boldest recommendations, which could make the most difference to total sums invested, are proposals to tempt pension and insurance funds back into investing in the equities of smaller firms, directly giving these emerging firms access to funds for innovation, in return for a share of their long-term capital growth. These funds own a substantial part of the stock market. However, their investment in equities, particularly in small firms, has diminished at least in part due to regulatory changes to de-risk pension funds and tax law changes with poorly foreseen adverse consequences for hi-tech investing over recent years. Furthermore, fund managers know that without special incentives, hi-tech investments are in general less profitable than easier-to-understand alternatives (mining, oil, gas and so on). So it is often financially rational not to invest in the very sectors that generate socially beneficial technologies over long periods of time. Ultimately that leaves us all with a dilemma. If we want UK plc to benefit from the next generation of science and technology-based innovations, or even choose the sorts of technologies we want to see commercialised, maybe we will have to think a little more about where our pensions and savings are invested?

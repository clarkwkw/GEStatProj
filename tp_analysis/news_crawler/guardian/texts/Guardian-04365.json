    "text": "Real philosophy (Back to big, Editorial 5 June) is concentration not on fact, which it respects, but on the logic of ordinary intelligence: 1) clarity, usually in the form of analysis; 2) consistency and validity; 3) completeness. Given this, it is inane to suppose it is dead. And given the messes that popular and some other science has made of the subjects of time, the mind, the nature of religious utterance, and consciousness above all, it is ignorant to suppose that that science needs no help. It needs condescending but compassionate tutoring.Ted HonderichGrote professor emeritus of the philosophy of mind and logic, UniversityCollege London  It is gratifying to learn that philosophy now sees itself as having a more expansive role in the UK. All the more shameful, therefore, that university philosophy departments at Middlesex, Northampton and Greenwich should have faced closure, all within two years of one another. With the unstoppable rise of cognitive neuroscience  imaging brains at work  there is an urgent need to review critically what many of us believe to be the new phrenology, by means of which defence pleas of &quot;It wasn&apos;t me, Guv, it was my brain wot dunnit&quot;, can be taken seriously by the courts. Raymond Tallis&apos;s recent presentation at the Hay-on-Wye book festival should form the basis of a wider recognition of the ways in which philosophy can help us from making such fools of ourselves.Dr Allan DoddsConsultant neuropsychologist and expertwitness  Stephen Hawking was right to insist that philosophy is dead. It should be, for, as another leading scientist Steve Jones opined, &quot;philosophy is to science as pornography is to sex&quot; (quoted in the New Statesman, 9 April 1993).

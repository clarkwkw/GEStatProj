    "text": "The scheduled launch of an unmanned Dragon capsule by a Falcon 9 rocket at 09:55 BST on Saturday, 19 May, should lead to one of the largest advances yet for commercial spaceflight. Both vehicles were built by SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies, a company established in California a decade ago that has ambitions, and now a matching order book, to become a major player in so-called space transportation. In particular, SpaceX is contracted by NASA to develop systems to supply cargo, and eventually astronauts, to and from the International Space Station. On 22 May, provided it can demonstrate its ability to manoeuvre under control in the vicinity of the ISS, the current Dragon should become the first commercial craft to dock with the station. After delivering supplies it will be reloaded with trash and redundant clutter for a return to Earth. A controlled reentry over the Pacific, should be followed by a splashdown and recovery off the coast of California on the 31st. Meanwhile, preparations are underway for the launch of Shenzhou 9, the fourth manned Chinese mission in nine years and the first since 2008. Its crew of three taikonauts, or yuhangyuans, may include the first Chinese woman in Space and is intended to dock with the Tiangong 1 laboratory launched in September. There has been no official declaration of a launch date or flight duration, but a launch during June and a length of some 12 or 13 days seems most likely.",

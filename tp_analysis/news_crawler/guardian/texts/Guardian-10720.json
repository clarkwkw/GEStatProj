    "text": "The World Bank has approved $500m (310m) of funding to buoy up Tunisia&apos;s economy, as the country continues along a rocky road to political liberalisation after the overthrow of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali almost two years ago, in the first revolt of the Arab spring. Along with the fresh funding comes a new emphasis on transparency and giving ordinary people a say in decision-making  making good some of the blind spots in the bank&apos;s dealings with Tunisia during the Ben Ali years. As a middle-income country, Tunisia would not normally receive direct budgetary support. But its bid to provide the Arab world&apos;s first example of a successful democratic transition will evidently not be allowed to fail for lack of financial or technical help. The World Bank put up a similar amount of budgetary support last year, and, with the loan approved this week, equivalent to about 3% of Tunisia&apos;s 2012 budget, it will have a modest leverage over economic decision-making. Such loans and grants from the World Bank, Qatar, the African Development Bank, the US government, the EU, Turkey and the French Development Agency will in total cover more than 8% of Tunisia&apos;s budget this year. Tunisia is not yet into clear blue water, either politically or economically, and external financing may have to continue into 2014. Unemployment rose after the revolution, hitting almost one in five at the end of last year. In the poorest regions, up against the border with Algeria, youth unemployment at 30-40% provides a background rumble of discontent. Europe, Tunisia&apos;s main export market, is wracked by an economic crisis, and Libya is not yet in a position to take back many of the 60,000 Tunisian migrant workers who returned home last year. In terms of offering advice, the World Bank has a mixed record on Tunisia. Before the revolution, it did highlight problematic levels of unemployment among young people with higher education diplomas. And in the mid-2000s it warned that &quot;special treatment for well-connected individuals&quot; was discouraging private-sector investment. But its analysts tended to tiptoe around the elephant in the room that was the rampant corruption seeping through the economy under the influence of Ben Ali&apos;s in-laws, the Trabelsis. They rarely entered the homes of impoverished villagers in the western regions  the same villagers who nowadays throw their doors open eagerly to any visitor to show lives lived with the bare minimum. Such factfinding was not encouraged under the Ben Ali regime. The World Bank&apos;s 2010 development policy review for Tunisia, just a year before the revolution, Towards Innovation-led Growth, was determinedly technocratic in tone. Influenced, perhaps, by Ben Ali&apos;s own squeaky-clean modernising discourse, it used the word &quot;innovation&quot; no fewer than 89 times. In a short section on poverty it cited official figures indicating that regional inequalities were narrowing. Times have changed, and this year&apos;s report accompanying the loan uses the word &quot;transparency&quot; 56 times (it received one mention in 2010) and &quot;participatory&quot; 25 times (not mentioned at all in 2010). Reforms &quot;to respond to the aspirations of Tunisians expressed in the revolution  need to be rapidly consolidated and expanded to translate into real progress towards the transparent and participatory management of public affairs&quot;, it says. In 2010, Tunisia won praise for the lowest levels of poverty in north Africa. However, the World Bank&apos;s statisticians did note that the official figure showing 3.8% of Tunisians as poor set the income threshold for poverty too low  laughably low, many Tunisians would now argue. Tunisia&apos;s national statistics institute has this year revised its methodology with the help of advice from the World Bank and the African Development Bank. Although poverty fell in the last years of the Ben Ali regime, it found, on the eve of the revolution, more than one in seven Tunisians could be described as poor. The centre-west region  the seedbed of the revolution  lagged behind the general pace of improvement. More than 32% lived in poverty in the area. In the past, cash benefits intended as a social safety net, and cards for free medical care, were often distributed as a way of building political allegiance to Ben Ali&apos;s ruling party, the RCD. The Tunisian authorities have decided to carry out a nationwide survey of poor households to build a new database for these benefits.",

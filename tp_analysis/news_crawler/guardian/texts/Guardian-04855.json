    "text": "   Fridah Mwapele, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    I don&apos;t know much about &quot;sustainable&quot;, but I know that &quot;development&quot; is about moving forward to a better place. Twenty years ago development in Tanzania was only benefitting a few elite people, especially in town. But now, even in some remote villages, development is obvious. Twenty years back it was difficult to get medicines in our dispensaries, but now it is easier. Because of aid, medicines and mosquito nets from donor countries, most villages are now receiving free kits and nets, although still not enough to meet the need. Medical specialists are increasing because of various teaching institutions and the opportunities to study health-related courses outside the country, so it is better compared with past years. The frequency of epidemic diseases such as cholera has decreased. Even the spread of HIV/Aids and malaria is low because of sufficient awareness. This has been possible due to assistance from donor countries. Now we have better equipment in our health centres, dispensaries [and] hospitals compared with the past because of support from donors. I don&apos;t understand much about Rio+20, and international meetings, but what I know is that Tanzania gets aid from rich countries that helps people in the country. My message to Rio+20 is to ask all the donor countries to bring professionals into our country and do away with cash aid. Because of the widespread corruption in our poor nations, cash aid ends up in the pockets of corrupt technocrats.",

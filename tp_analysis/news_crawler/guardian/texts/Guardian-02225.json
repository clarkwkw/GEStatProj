    "text": "When we used to bring our children on country walks and reached the sunken lane through this nameless wood, they always hurried through as quickly as they could. Late this afternoon, as shadows lengthened, it was easy to understand why. The tunnel of trees grip shoulder-high banks on either side with writhing roots, while their contorted branches cast long fingers of shadow into the darkening wood that might hide all manner ofchildhood terrors. There&apos;s a powerful sense of the presence of the past along this stony track, worn down by boots, hooves and cartwheels, where livestock moving between pastures grazed in the shelter of the trees and so ensured that no new saplings survived to replace their ancestors whose shed branches now slowly decay all around. But this moribund wood is a woodpecker&apos;s delight. The trees are riddled with their nest holes and foraging excavations. I sat on the roots of an ancient oak and listened to a pair of great spotted woodpeckers engaged in a springtime drumming duel. Each had chosen a branch whose state of decay gave its message a distinctive pitch, so there was no mistaking their call and response. Spring arrived, suddenly, here over the last week, teasing out the first primroses, loosening charcoal bud scales clenched around the ash&apos;s crimson flowers and unleashing a flurry of bird courtship activity. The mistle thrush, scolding from the top of another oak across the valley, would no doubt already have a nest with eggs. I could hear newly returned curlews calling from the high pastures at Park Wall. Loud mewing above announced the arrival of a pair of buzzards that circled above the bare branches with a few shallow wing beats and long, effortless glides. Spring, though, is fickle. I found myself shivering as the sun dipped below the hills; clear skies would bring frost that would scorch the hazel catkins on the edge of the wood tonight.",

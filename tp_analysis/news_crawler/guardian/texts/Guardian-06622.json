A computer hums away in the background, ready to be deployed for another job search. Toast&apos;s popped. It&apos;s time. Sigh. Pondering your own shortcomings isn&apos;t the best mental preparation for a job hunt. Positivity, right? That&apos;s good. That&apos;ll keep me going. Cool. I&apos;ve moved on from the first few school-free months spent teetering between fear and excitement. Reality&apos;s put its foot in the door. There&apos;s no money. No job. Nothing on the horizon. Job-site emails fill the hollow depth of my inbox, and applications are the point at which I come into contact with the real world. It&apos;s been like this for two months now. Living at home, bordering on despair, and not wanting to ring the job centre or rely on anyone but myself for my own welfare. Every day boils down to the standard routine of filling out forms I&apos;m sent by automated job servers. I&apos;ve not been called in for an interview once yet. I&apos;m too inexperienced for retail, not professional enough for a desk job. Bollocks. Work experience? An internship? Yeah, maybe. I keep looking. An offer. Unpaid internship. At a PR company. Three months. Mum calls: &quot;They are paying you, aren&apos;t they, Robbie?&quot; I send an email back: &quot;Can you pay expenses?&quot; They tell me they can&apos;t. An opportunity or just an easy chance to exploit? It&apos;s difficult to say. Winter turns to spring and fear turns to fuel. I&apos;m working, helping others out. It&apos;s unpaid, yes. But it&apos;s a start. With spring comes a new sense of ambition. Email exchanges are getting busy. This is good, isn&apos;t it? A step towards a career? I&apos;m doubtful. But it&apos;s keeping me busy, keeping my head in check. I&apos;m gaining self-knowledge: I&apos;m not old. I&apos;m an idiot. I&apos;m a kid who has realised that a pay-check is the point at which I&apos;ll know I&apos;m achieving some success. I spent most of my school years learning about graphics and web design through online guides  school seemed slow to catch on so learning from the web seemed the best option. Now these skills help keep things moving. One small job a month is enough to pay for the basics. Train tickets, the odd McDonald&apos;s, the phone bill. That&apos;ll do for now. What happens to those who leave education without a set of practical skills, just a few grades, and a certificate? How long do they remain stuck in the cycle of anxiety and fruitless job-searching? There are dozens of applicants for every job in this country, dozens of people desperate for a chance. One of those dozens is me.",

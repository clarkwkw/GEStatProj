    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Encounters with the Dead Space franchise&apos;s necromorphs used to be terrifying. Not so much these days: it still looks like Silent Hill in space  with its rusty, filthy corridors and sense of isolated dilapidation  but when the monsters turn up, shooting them isn&apos;t scary so much as great fun. That&apos;s ably assisted by the game&apos;s weapons benches, which let you turn collected scrap materials into lethal armaments and ammunition, a process that soon removes any sense of danger. Your battles with the game&apos;s beasts are now simply encounters with amusing groups of cannon fodder, artfully interspersed with zero-G sections and moments where you lay waste to everything in sight with a fixed gun turret. If you arrive expecting fear, you&apos;ll leave disappointed, but if your only aspiration is dismembering space monsters with homemade artillery, Dead Space 3 is money well spent.",

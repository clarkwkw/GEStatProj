    "text": "Banks should &quot;step up to the plate&quot; and offer more loans to postgraduate students, the universities minister has told a higher education summit in London. Expanding student loans for postgraduate study was not a possibility, David Willetts told the Guardian&apos;s Future of Higher Education conference. He said professional and career development loans were the &quot;classic device&quot; for funding postgraduate study. &quot;There cannot be a universal loans system, and I don&apos;t want to find us inadvertently ending up with student number controls for postgrads as a consequence,&quot; Willetts said. Career development loans of up to 10,000 are available to students taking courses that will boost their job progression. The government pays interest while students are learning, and repayments start as soon as the student has completed their course. Last year, banks gave career development loans to 44% of the 22,716 people who applied. Willetts said banks should &quot;improve the spread&quot; of loans available. Funding opportunities for students shrank this year when research councils announced they would no longer support those on taught master&apos;s courses. Financial support for those on research master&apos;s and PhD courses is to be cut severely. Last month the Sutton Trust, an education charity, warned that postgraduate study was &quot;the new frontier of social mobility&quot;. It recommended the introduction of targeted, state-backed loans to assist students from poorer or middle income backgrounds. The NUS, the Centre Forum (pdf) and university groups have also put forward proposals. Willetts said students should see tuition fees as &quot;a flow of payments via the tax system rather than doing speculative calculations about calculations of debt&quot;. Postgraduate application rates will be monitored to assess the impact of cuts to research council grants. Willetts said universities should work to improve the quality of their teaching rather than focusing exclusively on research. &quot;There are many committed teachers, and many students have good experiences at universities, but from looking at the national student survey it&apos;s clear that feedback is the area where students are less satisfied.&quot; However, the drive to improve student experience was at odds with academics&apos; priorities, he suggested. &quot;When you look at academics&apos; perception of what drives promotion, they don&apos;t feel teaching is being promoted in same way as research, and that is something I want to change.&quot;",

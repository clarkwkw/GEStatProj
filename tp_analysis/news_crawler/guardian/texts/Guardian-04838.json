These conferences are really good in setting targets, but the biggest issue is how we actually reach the targets. That&apos;s my big concern. I think we have to definitely reduce subsidies in fossil fuels. This year in Indonesia, we spent $16.6bn on subsidies. We need to make the financing mechanisms as friendly as possible towards renewable energy projects. The money spent for renewable energy and fossil fuels is unbalanced. I&apos;d like to have those two things spoken about at Rio. We need to have resources available locally. Small islands are providing their own local resources but the funding mechanisms need to be in favour of encouraging this. I really do hope and expect that governments can switch subsidies to funding for renewable energy and decentralise energy supplies to utilise local resources, so the role of the national government can be reduced. But we also have to make it known that people have to learn to live on less. Sometimes people will follow whenever we scare them. If we are not on the road to achieving sustainable development, we will face catastrophe.",

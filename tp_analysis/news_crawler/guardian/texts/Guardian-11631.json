    "text": "Monster trainers rejoice  Nintendo has announced a new duo of titles in the hugely successful Pokmon series. During a web broadcast this morning, company president Satoru Iwata revealed that Pokmon X and Y will be coming exclusively to the 3DS console in October.             The games, which represent the sixth generation of the series, will feature a familiar combination of monster collecting, trading and fighting. This time, however, the action takes place in a detailed 3D world with a new dynamic combat system. Three new Pokmon have been announced: a cute critter named Chespin, the dog-like Fennekin and an amphibian called Froakie. The video also hints at two new rare or &quot;Legendary&quot; Pokmon, one resembling a deer, the other a huge bird. In a press release accompanying the video, Junichi Masuda, director at Pokemon developer, Game Freak, states: &quot;We brought Pokmon into an entirely new dimension [...] The stunning visuals, a completely redesigned environment, game scenario, music, and communication features will bring smiles to the faces of video game players around the world.&quot; The Pokmon series started out on the Nintendo Game Boy in 1996, with the original Red and Green incarnations. The main titles have always been released in pairs, with both usually featuring the same plots and locations but offering different monsters, requiring gamers to trade with their friends to get the full set.  Although initially intended for younger gamers, many veterans have grown up with the titles and have remained addicted to the winning recipe of exploration and monster swapping. Over 200 million copies of Pokmon titles have been sold worldwide since the series began. The games have also been converted into trading cards, cartoons and comic books, making it one of the most lucrative video game franchises of all time.",

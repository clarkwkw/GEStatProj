    "text": "Every year, working out what to do when you leave school seems to become trickier. As your school days draw to a close, you get to hear about lots of options: going to university, attending a vocational college, training on the job, studying abroad, taking a gap year. All of them have their merits. But let&apos;s assume you&apos;re seriously considering going to university in the UK. What do you want out of that experience? A respected degree at a university with a good reputation, of course. But there are other things to consider: would you be happiest at a university somewhere beautiful and peaceful, or do you want to be in the heart of a bustling city with lots to do? Do you need to be close to your family? Are you looking for a university with great sporting or cultural facilities? The question on a lot of minds these days is whether you&apos;ll stand a good chance of getting a job once you have your degree. One thing&apos;s for sure: if you are going to be paying fees of up to 9,000 a year, you want to be confident that you&apos;ve picked the best course at the right place. And that&apos;s where the Guardian University Guide comes in. Our guide is different from other guides you might come across on the web. We focus on the things students care most about when they are choosing a course. Students need to know how good the teaching is, not whether academics are publishing lots of research. Will they get regular feedback on their work? What do other students think of the course? And do they stand a good chance of finding a job when they graduate? Answers to all these questions are contained in our tables. So this is how we suggest you use the guide:  Look at our subject profiles, which have been approved by academics who teach the courses. Pick out the subjects you are interested in studying.  Go to the subject league tables for the subjects you are interested in and see how highly they are ranked in each category. Think about how important each category is to you: do you care most about the overall ranking for excellence, or the level of student satisfaction, or how likely you are to get a job at the end of your course. Select the universities you most like the look of.  Go to the university profiles to find out more about what it would be like to study the subject you have chosen. You&apos;ll see what the university itself has to offer, how much the fees are, what bursaries you could apply for. We&apos;ll tell you how big the university is, whether it has exceptional arts or sports facilities, if it is close to the beach or has great nightlife. This should help you narrow down your options.  Check out the websites of the universities on your shortlist. At this point, you are not just thinking about what subject to do. You are looking at specific courses within that subject area. For example, we have a table on art and design. But if you want to know about a specific art course such as computer animation, you&apos;ll need to look at online university prospectuses to see what they offer and what grades you&apos;ll need to get on to the course of your choice.  There is loads of advice about applying to university on the Guardian Students site. Take a look at the articles by expert writers and see what students have to say about university life on our popular forum Blogging Students. More about the subject tables Here&apos;s a key to what each column on the subject tables mean: 1. Ranking according to the Guardian formula 2. Name of institution 3. The Guardian score/100 is an exclusive rating of excellence based on a combination of all the other factors 4. Course satisfaction is the percentage of final-year students satisfied with overall quality, based on the National Student Survey (NSS) 5. The teaching quality score is the percentage of final-year students satisfied with the teaching they received, based on the NSS 6. The feedback score is the percentage of final-years satisfied with feedback and assessment by lecturers, based on the NSS 7. Staff-student ratio is the number of students per member of teaching staff 8. Spend is the amount of money spent on each student, given as a rating out of 10 9. Average entry tariff means the typical Ucas scores of students currently studying in that department 10. The value-added score compares students&apos; individual degree results with their entry qualifications, to show how effective the teaching is. It is given as a rating out of 10 11. The career score is the percentage of graduates who find graduate-level jobs, or are studying further, within six months of graduation At some universities, there are so few students studying a particular course that we can&apos;t include them in the statistics. Courses with small numbers of students are listed at the end of each table, but are not given a ranking. That should not be taken as any comment on their quality. In compiling our tables, we have been advised by an expert review group of professionals from UK universities who have made critical comments and suggestions for improving our methods. The tables have been compiled for the Guardian by Intelligent Metrix, an independent consultancy that specialises in measuring performance in higher education. The rankings are based on official data collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) and on the National Student Survey, published by Hefce. If you want to know more about the methodology used to compile the tables, read the full explanation from Intelligent Metrix. And if you&apos;re the kind of person who likes raw data in spreadsheets to play around with, check out the spreadsheets on the Guardian datablog  they have all the numbers you might want to crunch. Good luck with finding your perfect course.",

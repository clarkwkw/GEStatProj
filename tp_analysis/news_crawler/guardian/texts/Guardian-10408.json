    "text": "What will farms look like in 20 years? Do small-scale farmers hold the key to global food security? Is there a role for GM crops to play? High food prices, concerns about climate change, and competition over increasingly scarce resources have pushed food production up the international agenda. What we eat and how our food is grown are increasingly political questions.  To debate the issues, the Guardian&apos;s environment editor John Vidal is joined by Patrick Mulvany, former senior adviser to Practical Action and co-chair of the UK Food Group, Andrew Dorward, economic director at the Centre for Development, Environment and Policy at Soas, and Morgane Danielou, co-chair of Farming First and private-sector representative at the UN committee on world food security. The debate was recorded at the 2012 Development Studies Association conference in London.",

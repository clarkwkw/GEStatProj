    "text": "After weeks of darkened skies, the Chelsea Flower Show was blessed with glorious sunshine on its opening this week. With thousands of stunningly beautiful flowers, trees and scents wafting in the air, it looks at first glance like a glorious celebration of nature But is there a dark heart to the beautiful displays of Chelsea? Is the show guilty of being complicit in environmental damage or is it part of the solution? To be fair, it is impossible to organise an international flower show and not incur a massive environmental footprint. Take the Australia Garden, which brought two containers of stone and timber by sea from Australia, shipped six absolutely enormous palm trees from Spain and flew 12 people over to staff the stand. The flights alone emitted 43 tonnes of CO2, or the equivalent of a year&apos;s emissions for seven UK homes. Or the floral orgy that was the Thai Garden, which imported 80,000 orchids, of which only 50,000 were actually used. But how do they manage to get all these flowers into bloom at the right time? The answer is bucket loads of energy. Rueslyn Nurseries said they had been lighting their fuschias since Christmas to get them to bloom for Chelsea. Two industrial heaters were used to the maximum for weeks before the show by another stand. Some exhibitors use chillers to prevent plants flowering too early. The waste of lighting energy was spectacular. The enormous three acre Great Pavilion, which is naturally lit, had nearly all its internal floodlighting and external floodlighting on, despite the glorious mid-day sun. Almost 50% of the open-air stalls along the main avenue also had their lights on, the vast majority of which were energy-guzzling halogen spots. Most of the catering was also ecologically poor, with every foodstall we saw using 100% disposable ware. Even the champagne was being swilled in plastic glasses. The 188 page show catalogue was not on recycled paper. An estimated 1,100 trees were felled just to provide the nine million sheets of paper used. Over ten years this would be a shocking 11,000 trees or a veritable forest razed to the ground. But there were some green rays of hope. Bob Sweet, RHS development manager, reported that nearly all waste was recycled. Peat products are banned as is any non-certified timber. Some RHS publications are printed on recycled paper. The groundwork end-of-show plant recycling scheme means some of the show-gardens find an inner city home. The RHS also provides advice to gardeners, including how to use fewer toxic chemicals. Among the plethora of tropical plant sellers, there is a tiny band of eco-friendly stalls. Interestingly, it is these stalls which often feature in the show&apos;s press releases. Philippa O&apos;Brien, who designed the fascinating Capel Manor College display on urban meadows, said &quot;I get upset about the awful conspicuous waste.&quot; Other eco-stands included Green Spaces and Urban Green. The RHS says it has been on a journey to make the show greener, but there is no environmental data on their website and they don&apos;t have any strategic plan yet to reduce the RHA&apos;s overall carbon and other environmental footprints. RHS member and visitor Tania Thorne said: &quot;Having seen the level of environmental waste, I would not have guessed the RHS had even heard of climate change&quot;. So is it an ecological monster or a fantastic show promoting the wonders of nature? The evidence sadly indicates it is more of the former. This was neatly summarised in Bob Sweet&apos;s response to the huge waste of lighting on the traders&apos; stands: &quot;I have no objection to it if it adds to the shopping experience. We are a consumer show&quot;. This is simply not good enough. The RHS as the nation&apos;s leading horticultural institution, should be leading from the front. Britain&apos;s gardens are already suffering the damaging effects of the climate crisis. Let&apos;s hope next year&apos;s show will positively demonstrate the actual level of urgency required and begin the process of turning Chelsea from an environmentally-damaging consumerist monster into the leading eco-angel that our gardens desperately need.",

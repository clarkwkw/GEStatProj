    "text": "As students, we are lampooned for our lack of culinary ability. There is some truth in the cliche. We&apos;re overly dependent on can openers, have a liberal attitude towards best-before dates and aren&apos;t great at washing up. With exams looming, things are just getting worse. A heavy exam schedule makes you feel like there&apos;s simply no time to fiddle with food. Even leaving the library to eat can be a struggle (the recent Blogging Students on library etiquette led to a heated debate about what was acceptable to consume while you&apos;re there). But before pop tarts and coffee become your meal of choice, think back to that apocryphal tale of the fresher who blew his student loan in one go, then contracted scurvy after living on porridge for nine weeks. According to NHS statistics, those aged 16-24 are least likely to eat five portions of fruit or veg a day  with young men less likely to do so than females. And despite talk of the freshman 15, we&apos;re also the least likely to be overweight. While you&apos;re cramming in facts, avoid becoming another sickly statistic and spare your digestive system a moment&apos;s thought. It might even help your exam performance, according to Bridget Benelam, a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation. She recommends staying hydrated, which means holding back on the caffeine. &quot;Sometimes, if you have to stay up working, you can end up drinking a lot of coffee  it&apos;s best not to drink more than four or five cups a day, and make sure you balance this by drinking cold drinks as well.&quot; Getting your fair share of vits and minerals is also key. &quot;It&apos;s really important to support your body and mind while studying. Carbohydrates such as breakfast cereals are an easy way to fuel your brain, as is vitamin B. You should get the right amount of zinc and iron, through foods such as red meats or green vegetables.&quot; Many universities now have Come Dine With Me societies, inspired by the television series, where members host dinner parties for friends at their student halls. Why not get involved? If eating a balanced diet boosts brain cells, then it&apos;s all in aid of revision. No need to feel guilty for taking time out to get competitive in the kitchen.

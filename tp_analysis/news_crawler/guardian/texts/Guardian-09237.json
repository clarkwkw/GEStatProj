    "text": "Some of the biggest international clothing brands and retailers have been criticised by a group of Chinese NGOs because of the pollution caused by textile producers that are claimed to be suppliers. A report published by the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPEA), Friends of Nature, Green Beagle, Envirofriends and Nanjing Green Stone highlights what the NGOs claim are deficiencies in the environmental management of supply chains in China. The report says that a number of textile manufacturers that allegedly supply material for the production of clothes for large brands and retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer, Disney, Polo Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger have been found to be carrying out polluting practices. The director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, Ma Jun, said the report found that many major brands which claim to have sustainable practices &quot;have not extended their management to the material suppliers. Some of them don&apos;t know at all who the suppliers or finishers are and therefore there is no environmental management to this process.&quot; He said that many of the suppliers violate waste water discharge standards and &quot;some dump the water without adequate treatment or even without treatment and others have air emission issues&quot;. He added: &quot;Some of the pollution is damaging to local environments, rivers and lakes and some impact on the livelihoods of local communities.&quot; According to the report, much of the garment-making industry has moved out of China due to a number of factors, including rising costs, to other countries in south-east Asia and Africa. The industry that remains in China is the dyeing and finishing sector which is resource-intensive and often polluting. M&amp;S is among a group of companies highlighted in the report, that lists a number of textile suppliers the NGOs claim make material for these companies and their alleged environmental violations. Ma said: &quot;We don&apos;t know even if they know who these suppliers are and we don&apos;t know whether they have been doing some sort of checks with any of them.&quot; &quot;During our research, we identified some of their [M&amp;S&apos;s] suppliers as having made very serious pollution discharges causing an impact on the environment and local communities,&quot; he added. However, a spokesperson for M&amp;S said: &quot;We have concerns about the accuracy of the report and are disappointed not to have been given the opportunity to discuss it with IPEA and correct the numerous inaccuracies. We take the eco and ethical performance of our supply chain very seriously and have already started a thorough investigation. As a condition of doing business with our suppliers, all dye houses that supply our suppliers must adhere to our strict environmental standards.&quot; Ma said if consumers understood the true costs, he thought they would no longer want products created through polluting and damaging processes. &quot;Consumers enjoy all the great variety of fashion products with decreasing costs but in the meantime I hope that they understand that this is not all coming out of the blue, manufacturing of these products are still causing problems in China and other countries,&quot; he said. Disney, Polo Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger were contacted but did not respond.",

    "text": "A dazzling sunrise convinced us that this was the day for a trip to the coast but yet again spring turned out to be treacherous. By lunchtime mist had enveloped the Farne islands and drizzle trickled down the windows of the ice-cream van in Seahouses harbour. We consoled ourselves with fish and chips and settled in the lee of the harbour wall to watch the eiders. Along this coast eiders are known as &quot;cuddy ducks&quot;, a corruption of &quot;St Cuthbert&apos;s ducks&quot;. They&apos;re most often seen offshore, riding crests and troughs and diving for crabs, but a few carry out their spring courtship in the harbour, where the drakes&apos; fine feathers can be appreciated at close quarters. Decked out in slick black-and-white plumage, enlivened with a sage green nape, a pink blush to the breast feathers and a black crown that hides their eyes, these masked lotharios cruise low and sleek in the water among potential mates, chorusing their courtship call  a cooing &quot;ah-hooo&quot; that seems to convey surprise and mutual admiration at each other&apos;s breeding attire. Eiders have an ulterior motive for spring visits to the harbour: the lure of chips, thrown by trippers who are charmed by their deceptively appreciative cooing calls. The closest drake spotted my rustling chip paper and waddled up the beach, instantly shedding his svelte image. As with icebergs, a lot of eider lurks beneath the waterline and  with his portly belly and stubby knobbly-kneed legs  all semblance of seductive grace was abandoned in his eagerness for a convenience meal. I pondered the wisdom of feeding him fatty fast food but chucked him my last chip, which he gobbled before competitors arrived. Then, realising that no more would be offered, he returned to the serious business of courtship, announcing his availability with another seductive &quot;ah-hooo&quot;.",

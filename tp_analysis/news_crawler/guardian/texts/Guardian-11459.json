War Games: WOPR (iOS &amp; Android, 69p) is a match-three game, set in the world of 80s Matthew Broderick movie War Games, where you play the role of Professor Falcon&apos;s global thermonuclear war simulator. EMERGENCY (iOS, 2.49) has you controlling various sets of emergency services to attend and manage accident and disaster scenes, before saving as many casualties as you can. Vampire Season  Monster Defence (iOS &amp; Android, 1.49) pits you and an expanding range of monsters from popular fiction against waves of do-gooding vampire hunters. Best of all, MicroMiners (iOS, 1.49) has you digging tunnels to guide groups of tiny colliers to the next seam of coal while avoiding pools of lava.",

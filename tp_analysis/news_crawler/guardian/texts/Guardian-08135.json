    "text": "The World Bank issued a global hunger warning last night after severe droughts in the US and eastern Europe sent food prices to a record high. Damage to crop harvests from exceptionally dry weather this year raised sharply the Bank&apos;s food price index taking it above its peak in early 2011. The Washington-based bank blamed the drought in the US for the 25% price rise of maize and 17% price rise in soya beans last month, adding that a dry summer in Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan lay behind the 25% jump in the cost of wheat. &quot;Food prices rose again sharply threatening the health and well-being of millions of people,&quot; said World Bank group president, Jim Yong Kim. &quot;Africa and the Middle East are particularly vulnerable, but so are people in other countries where the prices of grains have gone up abruptly.&quot; The bank said food prices overall rose by 10% between June and July to leave them 6% up on a year earlier. &quot;We cannot allow these historic price hikes to turn into a lifetime of perils as families take their children out of school and eat less nutritious food to compensate for the high prices,&quot; said Kim. &quot;Countries must strengthen their targeted programs to ease the pressure on the most vulnerable population, and implement the right policies.&quot; He added that the Bank was spending $9bn this year supporting agriculture and pledged that help to poor countries affected by food price hikes would continue.

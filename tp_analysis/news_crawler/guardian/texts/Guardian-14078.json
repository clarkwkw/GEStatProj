    "text": "Is Nick D&apos;Aloisio exhausted? Apparently not. In a week that has seen the 17-year-old newly minted tech millionaire hit the headlines, give back-to-back interviews across the world, fly to America to appear on primetime TV shows and find time for a quick phone call to me from the back of a New York taxi, hestill sounds sparky. &quot;I&apos;ve got a lot of energy,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t know why. It&apos;sbeen like a marathon.&quot; The high point? &quot;Seeing [the news on] the front pages of newspapers,&quot; he says. &quot;Those kind of things have been shocking, to put it mildly. When I started it two years ago, it was just a hobby.&quot; And the low points? There haven&apos;t been any, of course. D&apos;Aloisio radiates positivity. &quot;The proudest moment for me has been seeing these tweets coming through from teenagers saying, &apos;You&apos;ve inspired me,&apos; and I&apos;m so excited about that.&quot; We met in London several days earlier  the day after internet giant Yahoo announced it had bought D&apos;Aloisio&apos;s app for a reported $30m [19m]. He has had about two hours&apos; sleep. Everyone wants to speak to him  who doesn&apos;t lovethe fairytale story of how a British teenager came up with an idea in his bedroom and two years later sold it for millions? D&apos;Aloisio created an iPhone app called Summly, which summarises news stories, and was downloaded by nearly a million people. &quot;It helps publishers reach out to a younger audience,&quot; he says. &quot;There is a generation of skimmers. It&apos;s not that they don&apos;t want to read in-depth content, but they want to evaluate what the content is before they commit time. Especially on a mobile phone  you don&apos;t have the phone, or cellular data, or screen size to be reading full-length content.&quot; Yahoo, under recently appointed CEO Marissa Mayer, is repositioning itself to capture the growing mobile sector, so Summly appears to fit right in. But they&apos;re getting more than just some clever technology that they could probably have come up with themselves for a fraction of the price. In D&apos;Aloisio, Yahoo (an internet dinosaur that has struggled in recent years) have a bright, articulate and charismatic hiring. He is the star of this week&apos;s global PR onslaught. It helps that he appears to have neither the introversion of your stereotypical computer nerd, nor the megalomania of someone who was already being described as a &quot;boy genius&quot; long before this new deal. He is polite, likable and self-aware, saying he knows he has to be careful that he doesn&apos;t come across as precocious. &quot;I try to maintain alevel of humbleness to this,&quot; he says. Why does he think they bought Summly rather than creating their own? &quot;We work with some of the best scientists in the world  [at] the Stanford Research Institute.&quot; And his technology has an 18-month headstart, he adds. &quot;But they&apos;re also going down the position of acquiring talent, and there are some people coming over with me.&quot; But Summly has already been removed from Apple&apos;s App Store. Was he worried they were essentially buying him and his service out of the competition? He nods. &quot;I guess that could have been a negative,&quot; he says, if they had bought it and simply shut it down, &quot;but it was clear in the conversations we had and the time I spent on campus that we&apos;re going to do the best we can to integrate it.&quot; Hissummarisation technology &quot;is now the thing that&apos;s going to come to life, hopefully across a lot of different things at Yahoo. The goal, being the founder, was to get as many people in the world accessing this medium, and I think Yahoo is hopefully going to offer that.&quot; The money  he is not saying how much he personally earned after investors have taken their share  has gone into a trust fund. &quot;It&apos;s not like Icango into my bank account and pull out money to buy a car,&quot; he says. He&apos;d have to ask his mum? (She&apos;s company director, and his trust-fund nominee.) He laughs. &quot;Yes.&quot; How much money does he have in his bank account? &quot;Ihave a debit card, and I probably have about 40 on it.&quot; He says he&apos;s always having to text his parents for more. &quot;Genuinely, it&apos;s kept that low.&quot; Deliberately? &quot;Kinda,&quot; he says, before adding, with a touch of embarrassment, &quot;That was prior to all this happening.&quot; If he was a couple of years older, he thinks he would be more tempted to go and buy an apartment, a car, a holiday, but  still living at home with his younger brother, on a sabbatical from A-levels  those aren&apos;t things hehas spent any time thinking about during the past few years. &quot;It&apos;s almost like I&apos;m too young for any of this to apply,&quot; he says. He might buy some clothes, hesays, maybe a new computer. &quot;Onething I&apos;d like to do is angel investing in small companies. That&apos;s what&apos;s exciting, and if you are lucky to have a bit of money, you can take those risks. That&apos;s what I would do if I was going to go and spend it.&quot; In lots of ways he is still like any other teenager: &quot;I see my friends, see my girlfriend, maybe go to a party, try andplay sport.&quot; Is he worried about how sudden riches might change his relationship with his friends? &quot;People I don&apos;t know, they&apos;re probably going to see me differently. But my core group of friends don&apos;t. It is all a bit different now, but I&apos;m not going to change as a person. I don&apos;t feel different. If the motivation had been money, I&apos;d be going off laughing. But because the motivation was technology and product, this is just the beginning ofwhat I want to do.&quot; D&apos;Aloisio was born in London, but grew up in Australia, returning to the UK aged seven. His mother is a lawyer, and although there have been coy references to what his father does (along the lines of &quot;something to do with commodities&quot;) he&apos;s actually a vice president of Morgan Stanley. Not to come over all class warrior, but given his parents and his private education, does he really think anyone could have done what he has? &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he says in aninstant. &quot;My family doesn&apos;t have anyparticular wealth. We were an immigrant family, ageneration above [his parents are of Italian andSpanish descent]. It&apos;s no longer an education thing  if you look atthe top [tech company] founders in the world, half of them haven&apos;t finished high school or university. So I don&apos;t think an educational path thing comes into it. Similarly, location-wise, there are people in Asiaand Africa doing companies.&quot; I speak to his mother, Diana, and she laughs at the idea that it is her and her husband who are really behind their son&apos;s success. Was she surprised by what has happened? &quot;I&apos;m surprised it happened so soon, but we always knew Nicholas was technical and talented.&quot; She says she was never worried about the amount of time he was spending on the computer, &quot;because he would always show us what he was doing. I remember him creating 3D models on his computer as a 10-year-old&quot;. Is she worried success will affect him negatively? &quot;Not at all,&quot; she says. &quot;He&apos;s always had an older brain and I think he will cope with it very well. He&apos;s just a normal kid and I don&apos;t think that will change.&quot; D&apos;Aloisio got his first MacBook aged nine, and used it to edit home video. When he needed to upgrade to a better laptop to use different software, he pestered his parents for months, eventually persuading them he would use it for homework. In early 2008, when the Apple App Store was announced, D&apos;Aloisio  then just 12  realised it was a huge opportunity. &quot;I went into an Apple store with my dad and we asked one of the assistants how we did this [make an app], and they didn&apos;t know what we were talking about. So I had to wait another few months before it got released publicly.&quot; In the meantime, he says, hetaught himself basic programming using open-source software online and the book C for Dummies. When he launched his first app  a jokey app called FingerMill, a treadmill for fingers  in August 2008, a month after the store opened, it made 79 on the first day. &quot;So as a 12-year-old I was like, &apos;This is awesome.&apos; I did a free app called TouchWood [it made the screen look like wood and made a sound when you knocked on it]. It was gimmicky. But every time I did an app I learned more.&quot; Did people think it was strange that he spent all his spare time in his bedroom writing apps? &quot;It is a bit weird,&quot; hesays with a laugh. &quot;But I never told anyone. I still went out with my friends at the weekend, found time for sport, itwas just this thing I was doing.&quot; He came up with the idea for Summly in spring 2011. &quot;I was using Twitter a lot on my phone, and was realising there was a massive gap between the link on the tweet and the full story. If you could come up with a summary layer to show in Twitter, that would be awesome.&quot; Hehad also just been revising for exams, and was getting frustrated at having to waste time reading information online that turned out not to be useful. His first version was called Trimit, created in his bedroom, and almost immediately it started to gain attention  Apple featured it on the app store and several blogs wrote about it. A few hours after Trimit appeared on Techcrunch, the tech news site, D&apos;Aloisio received an email from a venture capital firm led by Li Ka Shing, the Hong Kong billionaire. D&apos;Aloisio, then 15, had never heard ofthe company, and thought the email was a joke, so ignored it. &quot;And a few days later I get another email. So Ireply,and we do a phone call.&quot; The investors, keen to come to London to meet him, asked when he&apos;d be free. D&apos;Aloisio smiles. &quot;I was going, &apos;I can&apos;t really meet between 9 and 5,&apos; and they asked why, and I was like, &apos;Well, school.&apos;&quot; He laughs. Did it put them off? &quot;I think they loved it even more.&quot; The $300,000 investment went into developing Summly. &quot;I was able to attract some key talent  for example our chairman, who is ex-Amazon, was able to come on and help, almost like a double act: wise, business guy and young, crazy founder.&quot; It would be misleading to suggest D&apos;Aloisio went from bedroom programmer to millionaire  he was also able to attract a network of heavyweight advisers and well-connected investors such as Ashton Kutcher and Wendi Deng  but this shouldn&apos;t detract from his achievement. He says he doesn&apos;t &quot;manage&quot; older employees: &quot;I mean, Iwork with them. They&apos;re equal, if notsuperior.&quot; His age has never been a problem, he says (other than for legal issues, when his mother has to sign on his behalf). &quot;Ithink people are actually more  not lenient, but positive towards me because this is my first time,&quot; he says. &quot;If I muck up, it&apos;s not intentional.&quot; He describes an incident two years ago when he bombarded the tech site Gizmodo with increasingly desperate emails begging them to write about Trimit; in one email saying he was about to be sacked if they didn&apos;t feature it, in another saying that without exposure, the debts he had run up in creating it were so high &quot;now I&apos;m going to have to go without food for the next month&quot;. (Gizmodo published these extracts with the heading How I Made a 15-Year-Old App Developer Cry.) He refers to it now, with a smile, as &quot;a learning experience. I&apos;m almost proud of it, looking back. Obviously, I&apos;ve learnt how to handle the media now.&quot; He laughs, nervously. &quot;But at the same time, look, I was a 15-year-old. End of. It&apos;s like a badge of honour.&quot; He isn&apos;t allowed to talk about the details of his Yahoo contract, or how long he is tied in for. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be doing this deal if I wasn&apos;t motivated by joining that company. I might be there in 20 years&apos; time, I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t want to rule anything out. I think it&apos;s going to be awesome.&quot; But he says he wants to go to university at some point (he plans to do his A-levels in 2014), and in the future set up and run more businesses  maybe not even a tech company. &quot;There&apos;s still along way to go. This is the start.&quot; He has to leave to catch a plane to New York, where he will do more interviews and appear on Today and Piers Morgan&apos;s CNN show. &quot;It&apos;s been an absolutely exciting, fascinating week,&quot; he says when I catch up with him days later. &quot;It&apos;s been manic here in the US.&quot; He has no idea what&apos;s happening next week  it depends on who else wants a piece of him. &quot;I&apos;ll probably be at home, with my family.&quot; And then it&apos;s off to Yahoo&apos;s offices. To start his first job.",

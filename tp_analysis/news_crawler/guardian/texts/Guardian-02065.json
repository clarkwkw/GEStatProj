    "text": "For an overweight cop with a predilection for booze and pills, Max Payne is certainly a graceful soul. As I control him through a bottleneck of armed thugs in an executive club bar at a football stadium, I&apos;m stunned by the smooth, agile way in which he hurdles over a handrail, pouring bullets into his foes. He lands heavily on his shoulder, rolls over on the floor and whirls back to his feet, snapping a clip into the submachine gun in his hand with a satisfying clack. He then leaps to his right, smashing through a glass panelled divide in the room. It fragments into a glistening shower as Max draws a bead on the last opponent he has standing, and the firing pin slams home. The camera switches to just behind the bullet, and follows it across the room as it ploughs the head of Max&apos;s last target. Ringo Lam would be proud. Of course, everything I&apos;ve just witnessed  just played through  was presented in bullet-time, the slow-motion visual style made famous in Hong Kong action cinema&apos;s hey-day, and coated with leather and shades in the Wachowski Brothers&apos; Matrix films. It&apos;s always been a tactical feature of the Max Payne series since Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment produced the first game. But while it comes in handy in the gun battles in all three games, it has to be said  it looks so damn cool. And in Max Payne 3, it&apos;s never looked better. As one watches bullets chew through wood and tiling, shell casings pop out of shotgun breaches and Max himself execute a 180 degree whirl in slow motion bullet-time, it&apos;s hard to imagine the game having the same visual impact from a first-person-perspective. FPS games rule the roost in the shooter market, sure, but this sort of animation  this sort of movement  wouldn&apos;t be possible in that genre, and it certainly wouldn&apos;t look as mouth-watering as it does here. The Euphoria engine running all the action on screen looks utterly flawless. There&apos;s no clipping, no pop-in and no frame-rate crawl, regardless of how many enemies are on the screen. Not only that, the controls feel great. The left and right triggers are the snap-aim and fire functions respectively. Alongside being able to choose the overall game difficulty, players can toggle the ease with which they aim; they can opt for immediate snap-to-target, intermediate where the crosshairs snap to the target&apos;s general vicinity, or they can leave the crosshairs completely unfettered.     Max Payne 3    Max executes a forward role if the player hits the A button, and if they tap it repeatedly he&apos;ll go into a sprint. The right bumper launches the game&apos;s shoot/dodge function, where Max leaps into the air sideways, emptying his weapons in a slow motion jump. Unlike previous iterations, players need to roll Max away once he lands, unless they fancy shooting foes from a prone position. It&apos;s worth taking in Max&apos;s surroundings before deploying the shoot/dodge move; during my playing time I managed to launch Max over the back row of some stadium bleachers, and have him fall seven rows while emptying a pair of Mac 11&apos;s. It looked absolutely brilliant, but as he landed, Max took so much damage that his enemies were able to pick him off with one shot. That having been said, shoot/dodge is probably the best way to break cover, which Max can enter if the player presses the X button. When attached to the edge of a wall, Max can be made to lean out to check his surroundings ever so slightly by flicking the left stick. Max&apos;s arsenal has been pared down quite considerably from previous games, where, by the final levels, players could carry up to ight or nine weapons, as well as the odd grenade and Molotov cocktail. The variety of weapons available in Max Payne 3 is still rather wide, but Max can now only carry three firearms at a time  two handguns and one rifle or shotgun  alongside thrown weapons. These are mapped to the left bumper, which brings up a wheel menu offering the choice between the different weapons. Players can also opt to dual-wield their pair of handguns, but if they do, Max will drop whatever two-handed weapon he&apos;s currently holding.     Max Payne 3    So Max handles very well and he has plenty of tools to hurl lead at opponents. The last aspect that rounds out the control system is bullet-time, which is activated by clicking in the left stick. Bullet-time slows all the action down on screen, allowing the player to quickly target multiples opponents. The effect looks and feels cinematic and superhuman at the same time; Max&apos;s movements become almost balletic as he whirls between opponents, firing round after round, and the soundtrack becomes a series of muffled thumps and screams. The entire screen takes on a brighter hue, as though it&apos;s been captured on colour-reversal stock. Not only does it look eye-poppingly good, bullet-time is a key ingredient in game&apos;s level design and dominates the way in which players have to approach different set pieces. In one instance, they&apos;ll need to have a filled bullet-time meter as they provide covering fire with a sniper rifle for one of Max&apos;s friends who is fleeing armed pursuers through a stadium. In another they&apos;ll need to deploy it to cut down goons who are trying to flank Max around a square ball-training pen. Players will need to keep an eye on their bullet-time meter, which appears in the bottom of the screen alongside Max&apos;s health meter. It&apos;s not an inexhaustible supply, and they&apos;ll need to keep it filled by executing moves like rolls, dodges and headshots. The more bullet-time they have, the more of an edge Max has on any bullet-slinging scenario. Max Payne 3 blurs the line between hyper-cool action cinema and cold realism. Imagine a film written and directed for the most part by Michael Mann, but whose action scenes were all choreographed and shot by John Woo, and you&apos;re starting to get the picture. This gritty hyper-reality is evident in all of the presentation and it also informs the game&apos;s plot. Max has relocated from New York City to Sao Paulo after being fired from the NYPD. A friend named Raul Passos has been working as security for a wealthy family called the Brancos, and he&apos;s offered Max a way out of his troubled situation. Upon arriving in Sau Paulo, Max learns that most of his job involves keeping an eye on Fabiana Branco, the young and reckless trophy wife of the head of the Branco family, Rodrigo. Presumably because bad luck follows Max around like a stray puppy, it&apos;s not long before a street gang called Comando Sombra kidnaps Fabiana and issues the Brancos with a ransom demand.     Max Payne 3    After a brief meeting in which the Brancos agree to pay up, Max and Raul offer to handle the drop, which is scheduled to take place at the football stadium of Sao Paulo&apos;s top team, the Galatians. Just as Max and Raul are about to hand over the money to Comando Sombra members, shots ring out from the stands above them and a sniper&apos;s bullet bites through Max&apos;s arm. He, Raul and the gang members scatter. Max and Raul then regroup in the stadium&apos;s infirmary and set about getting the money back. As they prowl through the stadium, they discover that a group of unidentified men in paramilitary gear are behind the sniper attack, and they want the ransom money too. A lesser developer would probably take that scenario and use it to hang action set-pieces on, and while Rockstar certainly makes sure the player gets a lot of bang for their buck, it&apos;s interesting to see how they push the narrative throughout the level. Each gunfight seems to throw up more questions about Max&apos;s predicament. Who are these well-armed individuals who crashed the drop? How did they know about it? Who fed them the information and who is backing their play? And, as Max himself intones towards the end of the level, why, after they&apos;ve all spent about an hour shooting up Sao Paulo&apos;s cathedral to football, haven&apos;t the cops shown up?     Tough New York cop Max Payne is back ... and so, sadly, is his paisley tie, which went out of fashion in 1989    Max and Raul leave the stadium without the money, but they do learn where Comando Sombra is holding Fabiana. Max offers to break into the gang&apos;s hideout and get her back, and it&apos;s here that Max Payne 3 showcases even more variety in its level design and style of play. The gang is holed up in a ramshackle series of warehouses by the docks, and as Max arrives, a torrential thunderstorm is well under way. This sets up two approaches the player can choose between. They can charge into the fray, guns blazing  after all, this is Max Payne 3  or they can use the rainstorm as cover and use a silenced weapon to draw as little attention to themselves as possible. Rockstar have clearly put a lot of effort into making Max Payne 3 one of this year&apos;s premier shooters. The game looks fantastic, handles beautifully and the depth of content in both its in-game design and settings seems to offer a ton of replay value. Not only that, it&apos;s story, which is set up in such a straightforward manner, seems to hint that intriguing denouement is on the cards for the game&apos;s titular character. Players should look forward to a tale of greed, betrayal and decadence wrapped in sleek, cool mechanics that allow them to tackle it one bullet at a time.  Max Payne 3 will be released for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 18 May",

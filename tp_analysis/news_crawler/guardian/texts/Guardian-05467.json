    "text": "The award-winning Elder Scrolls series of fantasy role-playing adventures is going massively mutiplayer. Bethesda has just announced Elder Scrolls Online, a vast MMORPG, set in the familiar land of Tamriel. Development is being undertaken at ZeniMax Online Studios, under the guidance of Matt Firor, who previously worked on the Mythic MMORPG, Dark Age of Camelot. &quot;We have been working hard to create an online world in which players will be able to experience the epic Elder Scrolls universe with their friends, something fans have long said they wanted,&quot; said Firor. &quot;It will be extremely rewarding finally to unveil what we have been developing the last several years. The entire team is committed to creating the best MMO ever made  and one that is worthy of The Elder Scrolls franchise.&quot; The publisher is releasing few other details at present, except that the title is being developed for PC and Mac. There is no release date, no beta announcement and no word on the payment model. The press release hints that the game will take in towns and environments from the whole series, but again, nothing is confirmed. The US magazine Game Informer will be featuring an in-depth preview this month. Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was one of last year&apos;s most critically acclaimed titles, shipping over 10 million copies in its first month on sale  the titles have become so vast, an online version of the world was always likely. The tricky part will be deciding on a subscription model, pitting the adventure against World of Warcraft, or a free-to-play model, pitching it in with a wealth of titles like Runescape, Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online and Lord of the Rings Online.",

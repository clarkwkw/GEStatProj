I accept the name and then try to change their minds.&quot; Kollie, 33, a mental health co-ordinator in Bong county in central Liberia, rides up to 200km a day along potholed, dusty roads visiting patients in rural areas. The majority are women affected by forms of what he calls anxiety or depression. &quot;There were a lot of war[s] fought here,&quot; he said, looking out over the ruins of the anti-terrorist unit base, once home to the elite band of paramilitaries who, under the convicted former president Charles Taylor, committed acts of torture and murder. &quot;Even though I was small I remember everything.&quot; More than 250,000 people were killed during Liberia&apos;s 14 years of civil conflict and much of the country&apos;s infrastructure was completely destroyed, leaving a republic scarred by decades of violence and carnage. A 2008 study by members of the American Medical Association found 44% of adults displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dr Benjamin Harris, Liberia&apos;s only resident psychiatrist, said: &quot;People tend to endure their suffering rather than seek professional help [because of the] lack of conceptual understanding of what PTSD is all about.&quot; The Carter Centre, an organisation that runs a mental health project in Liberia, states that less than 1% of Liberians have access to appropriate mental health services; in developed countries it is closer to half. In a region still reeling from the effects of the war, mental health is low on a long list of priorities. Kollie&apos;s desire to work in mental health was born of his own experiences during the war years. He was just 15 when his father, a cook at the county&apos;s hospital, was killed in a 1994 massacre by Taylor&apos;s rebels; he later watched both his sister and mother fall sick and die. &quot;My mother, because of the only daughter she had, got depressed and worried on it until she died also,&quot; he said. &quot;So from there I really decided to go into the health field.&quot; Kollie is now one of seven nurses in Bong county trained in mental health by Doctors of the World. As well as treating and counselling patients, his job involves advocacy work to try to change people&apos;s views of the illness. &quot;I feel so proud when I see my patients improving,&quot; he reflected after visiting 25-year-old Lila, whom he said became &quot;manic&quot; when she was about to get married eight years ago. Three weeks ago, Lila started taking mood-stabilising drugs. She has since told Kollie, for the first time: &quot;Things are getting better.&quot; Lila had previously spent endless hours with traditional and spiritual healers fasting and praying, while concoctions of herbs and leaves were pasted on her head. &quot;Sometimes I really used to feel bad,&quot; she said. &quot;They would tell me I [was] crazy. Other people used to tell me I [had] the cause.&quot; Mental health in Liberia and other parts of Africa is shrouded in fear and ignorance. People are often ostracised and excluded from the community, with a prevailing belief that the illness may have been caused by witchcraft and could be contagious. Kollie described how he has seen people chained inside houses where they are beaten &quot;to get rid of the demon&quot;. &quot;People even use them as entertainers to come and dance for them,&quot; he revealed. Last week, Human Rights Watch released a report detailing how patients in psychiatric hospitals and spiritual healing centres in Ghana are &quot;chained to trees, frequently in the baking sun, and forced to fast for weeks as part of a healing process&quot;. In 2008, the World Health Organisation launched the mental health gap action programme (pdf) to advocate a much greater focus on mental health for low- and middle-income countries. It estimates most developing countries dedicate less than 2% of the national budget to mental health, and that more than 80% of people in poor countries with serious mental health conditions receive no treatment. In Liberia&apos;s budget this year, no money was allocated to mental health policy. Dr Janice Cooper, who heads the Carter Centre&apos;s mental health programme in Liberia, has been working with the government, Doctors of the World and other partners to push the importance of treatment in Liberia. &quot;We need to have places in the country where people can be treated in their community and stabilised, and then go back home,&quot; she said. Cooper says she has seen people from the rural areas &quot;bound and gagged&quot; and placed in car boots to be taken to country&apos;s only in-patient mental health clinic, in Monrovia. There are plans to launch &quot;wellness clinics&quot;  dedicated facilities with in- and out-patient care  in each of Liberia&apos;s 15 counties. The first one, in Bong county, has opened; a red sticker on the door of a consulting room screams out: &quot;Epilepsy is [a] brain problem and not a curse or a spell&quot;, an attempt to dispel another common myth. The centre has begun an ambitious scheme to train 150 mental health clinicians by the end of 2015; 63 have already started working in the rural areas. Dr Cooper was involved in drafting the country&apos;s first mental health bill, currently awaiting approval from the legislature; close to two-thirds of countries in Africa lack appropriate mental health laws. &quot;We are making small strides, but there is a long way to go,&quot; Cooper says.",

    "text": "The government is to introduce legislation to end &quot;unreasonable&quot; fines on people who place bins out on the wrong day, Eric Pickles has announced. The communities secretary also said a neighbourhood test would be introduced to end &quot;ludicrous&quot; fines on people who put rubbish in the wrong bin. Pickles told Sunday Politics on BBC1: &quot;I&apos;m delighted to make the announcement that, given the unreasonable nature of these charges, we&apos;re actually going to legislate ... in the next parliamentary session which is in this year. &quot;We&apos;re going to have a test with regard to the neighbourhood. So if you put the wrong yoghurt pot into the wrong bin it is ludicrous to fine people. It is ludicrous to fine that woman who is I think a few inches out of a drive with regard to things. But what it would be reasonable is if people scattered their litter about then of course.&quot;",

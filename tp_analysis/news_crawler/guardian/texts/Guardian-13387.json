    "text": "Last week in this column, Idrove a car with a personality  theCitron C3Picasso. I liked it, it mademe smile, perhaps it even made me ever so slightly happier. Now it&apos;s payback time. This one is staggeringly uninteresting. Look at the picture: you can&apos;t without wanting to yawn, right? See? Aaaaooow. It&apos;s a personality void. And adesign void. Actually, it&apos;s worse than bland. It&apos;slike one of those people who brings you down with them. Or a vacuum  no, a leech, leech is better  sucking your life and your spirits from you. It&apos;s not just boringme, it&apos;smaking me a little bitdepressed. This is not what Ibecame a Famous Motoring Journalist for. Somewhere, somehow, though, through the tedium and the gloom, a faint bell is ringing. Not a joyous bell, or even a jolly tinkly bell, but amuffled, dull, distant bell, like the bell of a buoy at sea in thick fog. Strange, I know, that something so unmemorable is reminding me of something, but it is... Got it! The Skoda Rapid, anothergrey, life-sapping car, whichI reviewed in these pages last year. Actually, it is pretty much exactly the same car. It&apos;s even built by Skoda in the Czech Republic, under the Germandirection of parent company Volkswagen. I&apos;ve written about  been stultified by  this car before, then,just with a different badge. Sohow am I going to fill in the rest of this page? Well, I could tell you that the design bypass continues inside. There&apos;s something of the 1980s about it, not in a cool, retro way, more in a left-behind way. On a more positive note, the car isperfectly comfortable, as I&apos;m sureBurton menswear is. There&apos;s plenty of legroom in the back, too. And the boot is huge  cavernous, in fact (a McLaren buggy only just needs to be folded to go in). That might be of interest. And, actually, it&apos;s sort of OK to drive: the 1.6-litre diesel engine in this one does the job without putting in any overtime, but the fuelconsumption and emission figures are excellent. Oh, and it is good value. All of which I probably said last time round (I&apos;m not going to look, though. That would just depress me further). So an ideal car,then, if you&apos;re after value for money and low running costs, you&apos;ve got grown-up kids who still live with you (or just big ones), you have a lot of luggage and you don&apos;t care about design, personality or that your car is forgettable. And if you do remember it, it willmake you unhappy.

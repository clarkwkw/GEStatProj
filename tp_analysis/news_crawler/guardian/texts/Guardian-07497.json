    "text": "Ever wanted to close a drug deal? Or stalk your biggest crush? Help is at hand (at last!) in the form of a new smartphone app  Burner  allowing users to call contacts from a temporary number that expires a few days later, but use their existing iPhone to do it. The creators suggest it&apos;ll suit anyone who innocently wants to keep their identity private: for example, if you&apos;re selling something but don&apos;t want to include your real number. Fans of the US drama The Wire may be slightly more suspicious: burners were used by criminals to keep the police off their case. The makers of the $2 (1.50) app say they&apos;ll prohibit any untoward activity by logging all IP addresses. Nevertheless, app users have already set up a Tumblr blog to list lurid personal ads. Requests for sex feature highly. Thankfully, it&apos;s not yet available in the UK.",

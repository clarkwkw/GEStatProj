    "text": "Sales of organic products in the UK have fallen by 1.5% over the past year, continuing their downward slide in the face of ongoing tough economic conditions. Supermarkets are blamed in a new report for cutting back their ranges and shelf space, leading to a 2.4% slump in organic sales across the multiple retailers. But at the same time a &quot;Jamie [Oliver] generation&quot; of ethically aware shoppers aged under-35 is driving growth through other outlets, accounting for 16% of all sales, and significantly increasing their spending on organic food, drink and other products. According to the Soil Association&apos;s annual guide to organic trade in the UK, the Organic Market Report 2013, overall sales of organic products fell from 1.67bn in 2011 to 1.64bn in 2012  a smaller drop than the 3.7% recorded the previous year. At their height in 2008  before the start of the recession  sales of organic products totalled 2.1bn. The report from the trade and certification body for organic farmers notes that while the organic market is &quot;subdued&quot; on the high street, it is doing much better online and in large specialist retailers. Online purchases now represent 10.1% of spending through the major retailers on organic products, compared with just 5.7% of all food and drink spending. The online boom means that shoppers now spend 4.1m on organic products online every week. Ocado increased its organic sales by 6.4%, overtaking Asda and Morrisons to become the UK&apos;s fourth largest organic retailer. It also extended its range of fresh produce  including an organic pineapple  and anticipates further growth of 10-15% this year. Separately, new figures from Kantar Worldpanel underline the impact of the horsemeat scandal, revealing that in February 2013 total supermarket organic sales increased to their highest level in nine months  up 8.4% on the previous month. Jim Twine, a farmer and the Soil Association&apos;s business development director, said: &quot;In the worst economic downturn in living memory, it&apos;s not surprising to find subdued sales of a wide variety of goods and services  and the UK organic sector is not immune to these. Despite a decrease in sales overall, there are areas of significant growth highlighted in the 2013 Organic Market report. The Soil Association remains confident the UK organic market will return to growth  it is more difficult to know exactly when.&quot; Organic catering and restaurant sales rose by 1.6% in 2012. In non-food, sales of organic health and beauty products rose by 5.6%, and textiles by 10%. A breakdown of spending shows that more than three-quarters of households buy organic products, but sales are dominated by a small core of committed shoppers. A third of organic shoppers (33%) account for well over 85% of spending, while just 6% of shoppers are responsible for half of all sales (51%). And there is strong evidence of the &quot;squeezed middle&quot;. The C1 social class&apos;s share of organic spending has fallen to 32%, suggesting that it is the group which is tightening its belt the most in the face of austerity cuts and tax increases. Organic products remain most popular in London, the south-east and the east of England, the report shows. The capital alone accounts for nearly one-third of organic sales nationally.",

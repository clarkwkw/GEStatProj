Click here to view Although it uses Far Cry 3&apos;s game engine and mechanics, Blood Dragon has absolutely nothing else to do with it, eschewing all the attempted seriousness and hostage drama for a movie reference-laden story of cyber soldier Sgt Rex Colt and his assault on former employer, Omega Force.

From comedy opening to explosively cathartic finale, it&apos;s a joyous rollercoaster of destruction.",

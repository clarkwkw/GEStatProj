    "text": "    Tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol Ta and atomic number 73. As you can see from the above photograph, it&apos;s a rather lovely lustrous silvery-grey transition metal. It also is dense, highly corrosion resistant and highly impervious to chemical attack. Tantalum is found in the wild in minerals together with niobium, which is chemically very similar.   The name of tantalum is especially interesting since it was derived from Greek mythology. Named in honour of a story about Tantalus (who was the father of Niobe), he was punished by the gods after death by being condemned for eternity to stand knee-deep in water with gorgeous fruits growing above his head, both of which eternally tantalized him because neither was attainable. Swedish discoverer Anders Ekeberg, who named this element, wrote: &quot;This metal I call tantalum  partly in allusion to its incapacity, when immersed in acid, to absorb any and be saturated.&quot; [p. 1138; Norman Greenwood &amp; Alan Earnshaw (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd ed.). ISBN 0080379419.] Tantalum is not essential for life, but it is useful in medicine. Since it is non-irritating and doesn&apos;t react with body fluids, tantalum is used for surgical instruments and implants, especially hip replacements.  Tantalum&apos;s properties make it useful and therefore valuable but it is quite rare, which is problematic for large-scale and industrial uses. Tantalum&apos;s primary use is in capacitors and high-power resistors, which are in demand for automotive electronics, computers and cell phones.  Even though tantalum itself is not toxic to humans, the human desire to acquire it has proven to be extremely toxic to all living things caught up along the way: tantalum has been one of the main reasons for millions of human deaths and untold suffering, the wanton destruction or endangerment of wildlife and ecosystems and all-out war during the 1980s through the 2000s in the Democratic Republic of Congo [see this NPR story and this Born Free coltan reports index page]. Tantalum is so valuable that mining and smuggling of coltan ore (a mineral that contains tantalum) probably provided much of the income that supported the military occupation, prolonging the Congo conflict. According to a United Nations report [12 April 2001; link] the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, resulting in approximately 5.4 million human deaths since 1998 -- making it the world&apos;s deadliest documented human conflict since World War II.  Soooo, on that cheery note, let&apos;s hear a little more from our favourite chemists about tantalum:            [video link]  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

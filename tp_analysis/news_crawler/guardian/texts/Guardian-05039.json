    "text": "Jerry Leath Mills reigns as the unchallenged authority on the subject of dead mules in 20th-century American southern literature. Professor Mills established his reputation  almost instantly  in 1996, with the publication of a long essay called Equine Gothic: The Dead Mule as Generic Signifier in Southern Literature of the Twentieth Century. He retired that year after three decades of teaching English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His dead mule treatise appeared in The Southern Literary Journal. Equine Gothic reads as if the accumulated dead mules had been stewing in Mills&apos;s head, and were at last in a fit state for him to ladle out. &quot;My survey of around 30 prominent 20th-century southern authors,&quot; Mills writes, &quot;has led me to conclude ... that there is indeed a single, simple, litmus-like test for the quality of southernness in literature, one easily formulated into a question to be asked of any literary text and whose answer may be taken as definitive, delimiting and final. The test is: Is there a dead mule in it?&quot; He organised his findings &quot;coroner-wise&quot;, listing the different causes of southern literary mule death. These include: &quot;Coal dust and mine gasses&quot;, in Hubert J Davis&apos;s short story The Multilingual Mule. &quot;Beating&quot;, in Larry Brown&apos;s novel Dirty Work. &quot;Collision with railroad train&quot;, in William Faulkner&apos;s Mule in the Yard. &quot;Drowning&quot;, in many works by many authors. &quot;Decapitation by irate opera singer&quot;, in Cormac McCarthy&apos;s The Crossing. &quot;Falls from cliffs&quot;, in Cormac McCarthy&apos;s Blood Meridian. In Mills&apos;s telling, McCarthy is an impresario of fictional mule slaughter. In Blood Meridian alone, &quot;Mules are shot, roasted, drowned, knifed, and slain by thirst; but the largest number, fifty ..., plummet from a single cliff during an ambush, performing an almost choreographic display of motion and color&quot;. Other mules, in other stories by other southerners, exit by freezing, hanging, gunshot wounds, a &quot;fall into subterranean cavity&quot;, rabies, stab wounds, &quot;something called vesicular stomatitis&quot;, thirst, overwork, or, when all else failed to fell them, &quot;unspecified natural causes&quot;. Mills expresses wonder at all this belletristic mule mortality. During his own life lived in the American south, he says, &quot;I have never laid eyes on an actual dead mule.&quot; Through his very bookishness, he came to realise that others shared this particular obliviousness. &quot;I have been gratified of late to discover that I am not alone,&quot; he beams. &quot;I am pleased to read, in an article in Scientific American magazine, that the British army harbours a proverbial belief that &apos;one never sees a dead mule&apos;.&quot; I must report, though, that the Scientific American article goes on to say about the British army: &quot;During World War I many men made the acquaintance of mules for the first time, and many mules had their first encounter with partially trained drivers ... [This] ended only too often in events belying the tradition.&quot; (Thanks to GJ Reynolds for bringing the southern mules to my attention.)

    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Although it incorporates many of the series&apos; hallmarks  from frequent conversations on the codec to its trademark pseudo-philosophical twaddle about the futility of war  this is Metal Gear reinvented. You may occasionally use a stealthy-ish approach, but its formerly thoughtful pace is replaced by continual super-fast combat in the style of recent, inscrutably plotted Japanese tour de force Bayonetta. Replacing Bayonetta&apos;s dodge with a parrying manoeuvre, this is a game where bringing a sword to a gunfight will end in the gunman, his many cohorts, back up vehicles and helicopters being served julienne. But our hero, Raiden, wants to understand what motivates the henchmen he slices up; it&apos;s introspection laced with knowing humour, but let down by a dodgy script and wooden acting.",

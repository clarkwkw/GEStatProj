    "text": "This week, the first of a series of double-bills, in which we present a new interview paired up with a related interview from our ever growing archive.  In this show Alok Jha meets Neil Denny co-founder and presenter of the Little Atoms radio show and podcast on London&apos;s Resonance FM. Neil set out on a science tour of the US earlier in the year, writing a blog for the Guardian and recording conversations with great names in science along the way. Alok and Neil pick out some of the highlights, ranging from Carl Sagan&apos;s widow, Ann Druyan, to the director of the Hayden Planetarium, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Coupled with this conversation about science in the US, we rebroadcast our Sony Gold award winning podcast Sounds of the space shuttle, a retrospective of the final shuttle mission.",

    "text": "This marked route runs through the core of the ancient woodland of the Caledonian pinewoods in Glen Affric. In the lower parts, I trod carefully over the wet, glistening rocks along the banks of the river Affric and heard the roar of the falls long before I reached them. Thefalls are not high but the narrow, rocky gorge forms an impressive torrent of foaming water as it hurtles downwards. The long, narrow bridge below is over a large, peaty stained pool on a broad, shallow rocky bottom where the water scarcely seems to be moving. Perhaps an otter had fished this pool at some time, as on a waterside boulder was an otter &quot;spraint&quot; (dung) to mark itsterritory. Then came the steep walk up through the lower parts of the wood and the first impression of seeing a few dead trees that are an essential part of old woodland as they can support as much wildlife as the living ones. As I climbed upwards, the trees, particularly the old Scots pines  some of which could have been 400 years old  seemed to envelop me in a different world. Then on to the ridge and, walking silently on the thick bed of pine needles, I found myself standing under a single, huge, twisted pine. Below me was the Coire loch, perhaps my favourite loch, surrounded by the mainly Scots pine with occasional birch and rowan. The surrounding woodland was mirrored in the loch&apos;s calm waters. I reflected on the scene, which was awesome for one main reason  I was above the canopy of many of the trees. Itwas a different arboreal world and I suddenly felt very small and insignificant, as though put in my place by the ancient trees. There was something missing and then a single guttural croak of a raven made me realise what it was  apart from the raven, there were no sounds at all and it all seemed very moving and slightly forbidding.",

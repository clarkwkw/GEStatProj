    "text": "Studying development? You&apos;ve come to the right place. Explore our student resources page for the latest data sets and interactives, and find out about upcoming events, lectures and summits on our calendar. We&apos;ll be building on these resources in the next few months. Let us know what you&apos;d like to see. The Guardian&apos;s Global development site launched in 2010 to debate key development issues, including the millennium development goals. We host comment from a range of global voices, alongside news, videos, galleries, podcasts and resources specifically designed for students studying development. Your perspective is valuable to our online community; here&apos;s how you can get involved. How can I explore aid data? Can social media change the world? Each month we&apos;ll host a question and answer session for students. This is your chance to get advice from a development professional and debate with your peers the issues that interest you. Which academics/activists/enthusiasts do you want to here from? And which subjects should we cover? What&apos;s the best way to get a job in development? Recently partners on our blogosphere shared their top tips:  &quot;Decide what you are interested in&quot; and &quot;get involved with organising relevant activities at university&quot; suggests Oxfam&apos;s strategic adviser, Duncan Green. &quot;Study a second language,&quot; says Alanna Shaikh, and &quot;be prepared to volunteer your first couple of jobs&quot; is the advice from Chris Blattman. Is this helpful? What else would you like to know? We look forward to hearing your thoughts. Post your comments in the thread below. You can also contribute on Twitter @GdnDevelopment. If you have any problems posting a comment, or would prefer to comment anonymously, email us at development@guardian.co.uk and we&apos;ll add your views to the thread.",

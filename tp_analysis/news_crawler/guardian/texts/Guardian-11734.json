    "text": "No sooner did Mario Monti, the well-respected economist brought in to form a crisis cabinet following Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s controversial tenure as Italy&apos;s leader, announce he would stand down as prime minister than calls for him to stay in post began, with European leaders rushing to praise his personal and professional qualities. Such calls are telling: they reflect the knowledge, expertise and, critically, trust that Monti has brought to his leadership of the country. But I believe they also reflect the unique status and regard which academia holds in society. Monti has said he wants to continue playing a role in influencing opinion in Italy even after he stands down as prime minister (and recently announced he will contest next month&apos;s election). As he told Italian state television, &quot;I think I did it when I was a professor. I&apos;m trying to do it in this brief period when I&apos;m prime minister.&quot; Some might argue that prime ministers require a different set of skills to professors. But there is a rich history of university academics serving as cabinet members or advisors to world leaders, bringing input that is grounded in long-term research and has been debated with peers and students. Only academia is positioned to offer such independent input, and this should be a source of pride for the higher education sector in its overarching role of serving the needs and aspirations of society. It is perhaps a little known aspect of the Greek government&apos;s strategy for turning the country around, but engaging more university academics and technocrats is a stated goal of Greece&apos;s prime minister, Antonis Samaras. His intention is to create a balanced team of politicians, professionals and technocrats in running the government, embracing also the potential that exists among Greeks of the diaspora. Because of the economic crisis, the government has embarked on a concerted effort to involve them with the ultimate aim of driving investment in Greece. Many of these individuals, fuelled by the country&apos;s recently improved political stability and the agreed bailout by its lenders, are more committed than ever to help their home country. I have an inside view of how this goal is being achieved, being one of a number of academics and technocrats appointed to different roles in the new government. In September I became ambassador-at-large of the Hellenic Republic with responsibility for energy policy and new technologies, a newly created role to contribute to Greece&apos;s efforts to develop its energy sector as a key means of rebuilding the economy. It is my view that areas such as the energy sector offer much hope for the long-term viability of the Greek economy. That the government is constantly seeking specialists to contribute directly to the running of the country and the shaping of its policy sends an important message about Greece&apos;s values, ambitions and hopes for the future. New ways of working and governing are needed, and university academics are uniquely placed to help design the structures and processes to deliver this. It is a feature of government in most countries of the world that ministers more often than not lack experience in the cabinet role they hold. Rather they tend to move from one ministerial role to the next in rapid succession in their capacity as generalists. Senior academics can assist ministers by bringing specialist expertise in a given field as well as valuable experience in university administration, which has some degree of crossover with the inter-workings of government. Indeed, some argue that universities are a microcosm, or even a mirror, of society. Much of the work in this role will involve exploring new avenues for economic growth for Greece through the energy sector  I expect energy diplomacy to be the dominant language in inter-governmental negotiations. Overall, I am quite positive about the prospects of Greece in turning the present crisis into an opportunity for investments. I also take heart from the steadying force academia can be in times of governmental crisis.

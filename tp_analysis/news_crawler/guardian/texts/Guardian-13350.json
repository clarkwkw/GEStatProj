    "text": "    This week&apos;s element is polonium, which has the symbol Po and the atomic number 84. Named in 1898 to help publicise Poland&apos;s lack of freedom at that time, polonium is the first element whose name was politically inspired.  Polonium is a grey metal. Its appearance is somewhat more interesting when dissolved in dilute acids; the 2+ ion has a pink colour, but alpha radiation and oxidisation causes it to rapidly fade to yellow. All of its isotopes, eight of which occur naturally, are radioactive and have short half-lives, so for this reason, polonium is one of the ten rarest elements on Earth.  Polonium has no known biological role but it is intensely radioactive and thus, it is highly toxic in microgram amounts. In fact, its discoverer, Marie Skodowska-Curie, died of leukmia in 1934, the result of her pioneering work with radioactive elements, including polonium, which she discovered. Her daughter, Irne Joliot-Curie, also a brilliant scientist, tragically died of leukmia in 1956, ten years after a sealed capsule of polonium exploded on her laboratory bench.  Polonium was in the news not too long ago after Russian political dissident Alexander Litvinenko died in late 2006 from polonium poisoning. Only after Litvinenko died was it discovered that he had unknowingly ingested 200 times the lethal dose of polonium, secretly administered by KGB agents in London. This assassination marked the beginning of what was described as &quot;radiological terrorism&quot; (read more).  Outside of research applications, polonium has few uses, although it does show up in a number of surprising places, most notably, in cigarettes and other tobacco-based products. Tobacco plants concentrate polonium (found in fertilisers) in their leaves, so this element is present in both tobacco and tobacco smoke and is the likely source of smoking-related cancers [doi:10.1126/science.143.3603.247 &amp; doi:10.1126/science.149.3683.537].

Canon EOS 7D, 1/800 sec, f/11.0, 400 mm, iso:800    Question: This beautiful South American mystery bird is part of an iconic group of New World birds. Can you name this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is an adult pair of cream-backed woodpeckers, Campephilus leucopogon. The male is on the upper right whilst the female is on the lower left. Along with the piculets, wrynecks, and sapsuckers, the woodpeckers are placed into the taxonomic family, Picidae.  The genus, Campephilus, encompasses the large American woodpeckers, which are the largest woodpeckers in the world. The generic type species, the ivory-billed woodpecker, C. principalis, is the second-largest of all woodpecker species. All members of this genus are sometimes (erroneously) referred to as &quot;ivory-billed woodpeckers&quot; or as &quot;ivorybills&quot;.  The Campephilus woodpeckers have long been thought to be closely related to the Dryocopus woodpeckers, which are sometimes mistaken for them because of their large size and primarily black plumage. But in fact, DNA work indicates that the Chrysocolaptes flamebacks of southeast Asia are their closest relatives (doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2006.02.021).  Cream-backed woodpeckers are resident in lowland Chaco woodlands, in semiarid and transitional forests, and in savannas up to elevations of 2500 metres throughout much of Bolivia, parts of Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and down into northern Argentina, where our mystery birds were photographed.  This species feeds on beetle larvae that it extracts from infested trees by hammering holes into the bark. The bird&apos;s tongue is long and thin and is coated with a sticky saliva, and the tip is armed with rows of backward-pointing barbs that hook onto the larvae. These birds are not gregarious and adult birds typically feed alone when not breeding. When out of sight, a breeding pair maintains contact with repeated calls or double rap on a tree.  Cream-backed woodpeckers have black upperparts and underparts, a short, stiff black tail and grey legs and feet. The eyes are straw-coloured and surrounded by a bare black-coloured eye ring. The chisel-like bill is long and straight and ivory-coloured. The wings are black but the base of the flight feathers is pale rufous. The bird&apos;s namesake, its creamy mantle consists of white feathers tipped with pale rufous.  Male cream-backed woodpeckers have a scarlet head with a large crest, and a small oval-shaped black-and-white patch over the ears. Females have a red head with a black throat, forehead and crown, and the red crest has black on the front. The female&apos;s crest is longer than the male&apos;s. The female has a cream-coloured stripe extending from the bill across the cheek. Juvenile males resemble adult females with the exception that the adult&apos;s scarlet colouring is replaced with a subdued orange-red. Juvenile females have reddish orange only on the back of the head and under the crest.

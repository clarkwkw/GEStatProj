Mobile app design experts know to optimize their apps&apos; most important aspects while marginalizing (hopefully in a stylish way) less vital features. Microsoft seems to miss the boat here.  For instance, look at the Microsoft Office app for Windows Phone 8. Note that the header of the app says &quot;Office&quot; in big red letters. The bottom has a gray bar with a search icon and a folder and the settings button. An app designer I know looked at that and said, &quot;why the heck is Microsoft wasting all this space with the header and footer?&quot; Issues like that crop up in many of Microsoft&apos;s own apps.  The GPS: a fatally misleading travel companion &gt;&gt; NPR July 2011:   Two summers ago, a mother and son on a camping trip had GPS in their car and got stuck on an abandoned mining road [in Death Valley, Utah] for five days.  &quot;She barely survived. The boy did not survive,&quot; [Death Valley ranger Charlie Callaghan] says.  Callagan wondered if part of the problem was that out here, GPS companies might be relying on old maps with roads that have long been closed.   The error was in the data used by all the major GPS companies, including Nokia&apos;s Navteq, TomTom, and Google. Fun Places on the Internet (in 1995) &gt;&gt; Paleofuture Matt Novak:   The Internet was a precious commodity to me then -- a metered experience that I had to track diligently so as not to waste a single minute. That is, until AOL offered flat-rate unlimited monthly billing in 1996.   Just look at that scenery! Why Google Maps is better than Apple Maps &gt;&gt; The Atlantic Alexis Madrigal:   Nokia had been making quarterly updates, but Nokia&apos;s Fox told me they&apos;d be at weekly intervals by the end of the year. Apple may be in a tougher position because they don&apos;t own all their own data; we don&apos;t know what the feedback process is for improving their maps. My guess is that it can&apos;t be better than Google&apos;s, which is approaching the real-time dream, according to Google&apos;s Manik Gupta, the senior product manager for Maps. That means that not only are Apple&apos;s maps worse, but they&apos;re probably not even improving at a faster clip.  The takeaway here is odd. It&apos;s not about Big Data but Big Labor. Apple employs roughly 25,000 people in the core business (outside retail), so it might be unthinkable to hire a few thousand people (more than 10 percent of the current company) to make its maps competitive. But so far, that&apos;s the only proven way to build a great digital mapping system. Deal with that. Or deal with Google.  Dell quits smartphone business globally, drops Android &gt;&gt; Forbes  Now in the 5th year of its &quot;transformation,&quot; Dell&apos;s mobile strategy looks very much like it was before its push in the consumer business and the adoption of Google&apos;s Android system for most of its mobile devices (Streak, Aero, Thunder).  &quot;It&apos;s a content play with Android. Amazon is selling books and Google is making it up with search. So far we couldn&apos;t find a way to build a business on Android,&quot; added [Jeff] Clarke [head of Dell&apos;s Consumer Division].  It now only costs $100 to know everything about your DNA &gt;&gt; Gizmodo  Mapping out your genome is the 21st Century equivalent of staring deep inside your soul; it&apos;s tempting to look, but terrifying what you might find. The DNA divers at 23andMe are hoping that slashing the price of their home-testing service--from $300 down to $100--will be enough to tilt the scales towards discovery. Are they right?   Well, it&apos;s not everything. But it&apos;s a lot. A question of identity &gt;&gt; Tim Harford  You can get a sense of the opportunities available from the iris-scanning ID system introduced by the state of Andhra Pradesh in 2008 after a botched effort in 2005. The system dramatically reduced fraudulent duplicate payouts. Frances Zelazny of the Center for Global Development estimates that the system paid for itself within one month.  ID systems have proved their worth elsewhere. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, 180,000 former soldiers have received cash pensions as an incentive to demobilise. The system uses mobile ATMs, smart cards and iris-scanning technology.  Microsoft: Barclays cuts estimates on weak PCs, slow Surface ramp &gt;&gt; Forbes  [Barclays Capital analyst Raimo] Lenschow notes that the current valuation builds in a substantial future erosion of the company&apos;s Windows franchise. &quot;Based on our analysis, we believe the current share price suggests that Windows is potentially losing 30-50% of its consumer business and around 20% of its enterprise business over the long term,&quot; he writes. &quot;Given the current pace of cannibalization and tablet share trends, this scenario may not be a bad starting point, in our view.&quot;   Losing it in terms of ratio of annual replacement, perhaps. He also cut his forecast for the fourth quarter of Surface shipments from 2m to 700,000. Apple to enhance resolution of next-generation iPad mini, say sources &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Apple&apos;s next-generation iPad mini will focus mostly on enhancing the device&apos;s display resolution, according to Taiwan-based backlighting industry sources.  The sources have yet to specify whether the device will use Apple&apos;s Retina Display technology to enhanced resolution, but market observers said it is highly likely based on the development of past Apple products such as the iPhone and 9.7-inch iPad series.   Not just sources, but backlighting sources. The Guardian and Facebook - a more social experience &gt;&gt; guardian.co.uk  In the future, for example, users on our site may be able to &apos;agree&apos; or &apos;disagree&apos; with comment pieces, take part in polls or express their view on the likelihood of a football rumour coming true. The key thing is that the user will be in control and if they&apos;re not interested in sharing it will not impact on their experience of accessing our content on guardian.co.uk.  As part of this switch in focus, from Monday 17 December we will begin directing users who click on a Guardian link within Facebook straight to our website to view articles, so over time all users will no longer be shown the content on a page within Facebook.  How Google&apos;s Maps App for iPhone hurts Nokia &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  Just hours after the Google Maps app was released Wednesday night, it skyrocketed to the No. 1 spot on Apple&apos;s list of most downloaded free apps, with thousands of five-star reviews. Nokia&apos;s maps app, Here, got a lot of buzz when it came out in November, but a majority of users rated it one star.  A chart on AppData, an analytics service that tracks the rankings of apps, shows that downloads of Nokia&apos;s Here app took a nosedive in late November. Now Nokia&apos;s maps don&apos;t appear to be gaining any traction in the App Store.   Every silver lining has a cloud. You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

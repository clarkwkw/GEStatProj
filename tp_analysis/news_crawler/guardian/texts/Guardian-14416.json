    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Telling the story of a tiny hovering robot whose two glowing, quirkily wide-set eyes give it an immediate air of anthropomorphic innocence, Unmechanical is a charming physics-based puzzle game. Entirely wordless, it introduces its challenges by letting you experiment with the environment, moving about by dragging a finger in front of your robot and tapping it to produce a tractor beam that lets you manipulate nearby objects. Your explorations reveal organic-looking structures as well as mechanical ones, leaving you to work out what&apos;s going on; the pathos of its mute android protagonist is implied rather than overt, as you clink unavoidably against walls and ceilings in the game&apos;s sometimes cluttered, sometimes cavernous surroundings. The soundscape shifts subtly as you move between areas, and the beauty of its art style creates a rare ambience of bashed-up metal mixed with living tissue as you make good your escape. Its problems are intensely satisfying to solve and while none prove all that strenuous, many are refreshingly original. Unmechanical is a wonderfully relaxing way to spend a few hours.",

    "text": "     Announced three years ago, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was originally in development at Kojima Productions before the team gave up on making a cogent game out of the central sword-slashing interface. So in stepped offbeat studio Platinum Games and the project was saved.  The result looks to be a super violent action romp, filled with cyborg assassins and robot killing machines. Players control Raiden&apos;s sword in naturalistic slow-mo arcs, chopping up enemies like shop window dummies made out of salami. There is blood everywhere, there is fighting on the top of moving trains, you can rip spines out. If it all sounds like hyperkinetic madness, ti should&apos;t come as a surprise that the producer is Atsushi Inaba, the man behind Viewtiful Joe and cult Capcom actioner, God Hand.  Anyway, check this out and let us know what you think.",

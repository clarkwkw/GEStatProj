    "text": "This week on Tech Weekly with Aleks Krotoski, tech venture capitalist Fred Wilson discusses his latest investment in SoundCloud. Jemima Kiss, the Guardian&apos;s digital correspondent talks to Wilson about the audio hosting social site and why the site is described as the YouTube of audio.  Jemima also meets co-founder of Lanyrd.com Simon Willison. Lanyrd.com is an events and conferences information and networking site and one of the many exciting tech start-ups based in London&apos;s Tech City. Simon tells Jemima how a bout of food poisoning and a great idea on his honeymoon led him and his wife to create the company. Also Guardian Technology editor, Charles Arthur, joins Aleks to discuss the 20th anniversary of the first SMS text, Syria&apos;s closing down of the internet and why a geo-tagged photo has added to the bizarre story of tech pioneer John McAfee.",

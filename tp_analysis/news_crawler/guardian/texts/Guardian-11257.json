    "text": "     In the 1980s, the Diama dam was built at the estuary of the Senegal river to prevent saltwater from flowing into agricultural lands and to provide electricity. But the dam had unintended consequences  an upsurge of a water parasite called human schistosomiasis in villages upriver of the barrier. A neglected tropical disease spread by water snails, schistosomiasis  or schisto  is caused by worms. It damages internal organs and, in children, impairs growth and cognitive development. Schisto kills 200,000 people a year. Of the 200m cases recorded annually, 184m are in Africa. Senegal has the highest transmission rate of schisto in the world. Women and children, who spend the most time in the water washing clothes and dishes, are at highest risk of infection. The dam on the Senegal river had blocked the migration of the snail&apos;s natural predator, native freshwater prawns, which could no longer migrate upriver from their hatching ground at the estuary. Now Projet Crevette (French for prawn) seeks to restore the prawn population in the lower Senegal river basin. Elizabeth Huttinger, a member of the Crevette team, which won a $100,000 (61,800) Grand Challenges Canada award, plans to introduce millions of prawns to the river, not only as a way of combating schisto but also to provide a livelihood for villagers. The giant river prawns, which reach market size in six months, sell for five times the price of fish. The prawns are being hatched in 10 tanks and bred in floating cages at selected villages along the river. The aim is to develop a prawn hatchery capable of producing tens of millions of fingerlings (baby prawns) every breeding cycle, which can be sold to village co-operatives. However, for the project to become self-sustaining, a &quot;water ladder&quot; needs to be built that will allow the prawns to make their way over the dam once they hatch at the estuary and continue their migration to settle on banks to hunt and eat snails further up the river. The plan is to make a ladder similar to one on the Lobe river in Cameroon, using boulders and a waterfall. The project has already seen a reduction of schisto at villages where prawns are being raised. Since the start of the project in February 2011, the infection rate has dropped by half among a group of 256 people in the village of Lampsar close to the town of Saint Louis near the mouth of the Senegal river. What has surprised Huttinger and her team is a big drop in the &quot;parasite load&quot; in the test group. In layman&apos;s terms, it means the presence of eggs or worms has dropped considerably. &quot;There has been a 10-fold decrease this year from last year. That has been the really exciting part. That has been astounding and was not expected. The prawns are doing their job exceptionally well,&quot; says Huttinger in a telephone interview from Pasadena, California. There has also been a change in behaviour, says Huttinger, with the women and children no longer pouring dirty washing water back into the river but into cesspits. &quot;The women decided on their own to build a cesspit near the wash point. Now they pour dirty water into the pit because it&apos;s better for the prawns,&quot; she says, adding that government agencies had shown strong support for the project. What attracted Huttinger  a linguist with a background in public health  to the project was its potential for sustainability, as the prawns not only bring health but also economic benefits. &quot;When I heard of this idea from Armand Kuris from the University of California, I realised its potential for sustainability was exceptional  it is something that would have a lasting effect. People can feed themselves and stay healthy.&quot; The project will cost $500,000. Huttinger says that&apos;s not bad, considering the $20m that has been spent on drugs and vaccines against schisto.",

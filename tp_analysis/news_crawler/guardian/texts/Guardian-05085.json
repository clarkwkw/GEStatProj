    "text": "I recently drove a Peugeot that had a funny little see-through screen that flippedup on top of the dashboard in front of the steering wheel. On to thescreen the car&apos;s speed was projected. Good idea  I could seehow fast I was going without myeyes leaving the road, though Ihave to say the temptation to burnrubber isn&apos;t great in a Peugeot3008. This car has an even better system. My speed is projected ontothe bottom of the windscreen; it&apos;s perfectly clear both day and night. And it&apos;s plugged into the GPS,too, so up there next to the speed I&apos;m going is the speed limit ofwhere Iam, in a little red speed limit sign. Not only is the system neater, but it&apos;s also more likely to be needed. Because the BMW M5 is a beast. What kind of beast? A shark  because it&apos;s big and grey and has afin on the roof and gills on the side.And because it can cruise smoothly and effortlessly, and then, when it needs to bam, it&apos;s off  powerful, fast, dangerous. Very powerful  560 horses powerful. Very fast  0-60 in 4.4 seconds (that&apos;s Porsche fast, but this is a big fat saloon, with room for five and their luggage, not that you&apos;d know it, so well does it handle). And very dangerous, especially if you have afew points on your licence. The M5 is temptation itself. It whispers in your ear, &quot;Go on, be naughty. You know you want to,Jeremy&quot; Jeremy? Who the hell is Jeremy?Ilook in the mirror. Oh my God, I&apos;m Jeremy. My hair has grizzled, I&apos;ve developed a paunch and some rather unpalatable views, I dress like a twat, I am a twat, and I appeal to twats (well, I must do, because I suddenly rather like myself). I have actually turned intoClarkson. Which is probably why I find myself so attracted to this car, eventhough the only place youcould properly appreciate it would be on a track. I mean, it&apos;s insane, as the numbers-in-the-windscreen thing constantly reminds you. Justkeeping the figureon the leftequal to or less than the figure in the red circle onthe right is a constant battle, anexercise in mind control. The horses are whinnying, trying toescape; the Jaws music begins,der dum, der dum, der dum dum dum Wild animals andmetaphors are becoming confused. And excited. As is Jeremy. Deep down in his loins, he&apos;sbecoming aroused... Euurrgh, I&apos;m sorry. No one should have to read that, ever. I&apos;m sorry. Take this thing away, it&apos;s bad for me. I love it.

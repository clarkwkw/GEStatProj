    "text": "Spring is currently in limbo with few signs of wild flowers. The perishing cold has stopped lots of plants in their tracks, although there have also been some benefits, with snowdrops and crocuses enjoying an unexpectedly long flowering season. And when the weather was a lot milder earlier in March, the very earliest spring flowers managed to get going, such as colt&apos;s foot, which looks like a dandelion, and lesser celandine, a golden star-shaped flower and cousin of the buttercup. The lesser celandine has the uncanny knack of craning its flowers round to track the sun during the day, presumably to trap solar energy to entice early insects into its warm embrace, but when skies turn overcast the petals close up altogether. The lesser celandine was also William Wordsworth&apos;s favourite flower, who wrote three poems about it. Maybe spring will not get underway until well into April, with wild daffodils, primroses, wild garlic and many other familiar flowers, and as for bluebells they probably will not flower until well into May. But maybe this late appearance is no bad thing, because a long slow spring gives more time to appreciate the flowers, especially compared to the extraordinary explosion of springtime in the heatwave of last March. And perhaps this spring is not such a freak event as something of a nostalgic return to the cold springtimes of many years ago, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, when late springs were much more common.",

    "text": "We urge the government to think againabout pushing ahead with phonicschecks for six-year-olds (Report,11 June). We do not believe thisis the bestway to improve literacy in schools. Nor do we believe that this will help parents know how well their children are learning to read. Our objections are not about using phonics when teachingchildren to read, provided the government doesn&apos;t insist it is the only method used, but about the checks themselves. They will not show whether a child can understand the words they are reading, nor provide teachers with any information about children&apos;s reading ability they did not already know. The use of made-up words  like snemp, osk, jound  risks confusing children for whom English is a second language and those with special educational needs, and frustrate those who can already read. And using unrealistic, arbitrary benchmarks in the checks plucked out of the air is of benefit to no one. Many of those working in primary education fear that these tests could undermine rather than benefit children&apos;s progress and development.Mary Bousted General secretary, Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Russell Hobby General secretary, National Association of Head Teachers, Christine Blower General secretary, National Union of Teachers, David ReedyUnited Kingdom Literacy Association, Stephen Twigg MP Shadow secretary of state for education, Lisa Nandy MP Shadow children&apos;s minister, Pat Glass MP Education select committee, Ian Mearns MP Education select committee, Annette Brooke MP, Caroline Lucas MP, Michael Rosen Children&apos;s author, Alan Gibbons Children&apos;s author",

    "text": "Quick time events  key moments where the split-second reaction to onscreen prompts determines success or failure  are the bane of many gamers, who may wish to steer clear of Asura&apos;s Wrath: QTEs play a big part in Capcom&apos;s ode to anger. However, they also serve to make the game exciting in a way few other mediums can manage. Epic battles will see Asura  formerly a demi-god, now raging at his peers after a 12,000-year imprisonment  punching out space armadas or beating up planet-sized enemies. In between, smaller-scale fights against swarms of grunts give the player more direct control and progress the game&apos;s melodramatic story, itself a mind-bending mix of Hinduism, mad anime and science fantasy. At its core, Asura&apos;s Wrath is eye-candy, pure and simple. Challenge is minimal, direct control even less but it&apos;ll win you over just by virtue of being so gloriously, insanely over-the-top in its presentation.",

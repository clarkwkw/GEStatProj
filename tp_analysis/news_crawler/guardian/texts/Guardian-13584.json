    "text": "When Blizzard first announced that Starcraft 2 would feature only a Terran campaign, you could hear collective groans from every corner of cyberspace. After all, it was the expert balancing of three separate races, each with their own interlocking storylines that made the original such a step change for real time strategy games. Some of that disappointment was dispelled by the misguided belief that at least we would not have to wait long for the next instalment. That was nearly three years ago  so is it all we hoped for? HotS picks up where Wings of Liberty left off, this time picking up Sarah Kerrigan&apos;s tale. Now stripped of her Queen of Blades memories, your task is to rebuild the Zerg swarm and take on the evil Arcturus Mengsk and occasionally just about everyone else. As with WoL, you do get the chance to dabble with the other two races, courtesy of old allies Raynor and Valarian. However, the single player emphasis here is on Zerg who behave very differently to the obedient Terrans and the methodical Protoss. Zerg forces move fast and grow organically, terraforming the landscape to expand. As such, HotS gives us an excellent test of the improved AI with route-finding seeing fewer units getting lost or stranded and forces defending their ground with new confidence.

Well, for starters there&apos;s a few welcome tweaks to the interface, particularly useful with Zerg who were always the fiddliest race to control, thanks to their confusing reproductive cycle that left you unsure what to click to get what result. It&apos;s still a bit confusing but at least drones now automatically head for resources and there&apos;s a single button to select all armed units at once. Nevertheless, HotS remains a brutal test of micro management skills, and without deft use of hot keys you&apos;re never going to keep track of all your units or compete with better players. Another big change is an overhaul of the upgrade system, replacing the tedious balancing of Protoss and Zerg research points with a three-tier system. Firstly, there&apos;s three power upgrades per unit  usually a choice between movement, combat and spawning speed, which can be changed at any time. However, you can also unlock more radical Evolutionary changes, picking one of two permanent upgrades that radically effect the shape, behaviour and animation of each unit. These are quite brilliant  with even lowly Zerglings instantly morphing into winged insects that swarm over enemies with nauseating zeal. Sadly, these evolutions are prefaced by linear mini-map challenges, which become more of a chore than a pleasure to go through. Finally, there&apos;s Hero upgrades to give Kerrigan additional physical or tactical abilities. The point of all these changes is to make most of the upgrade paths reversible  unlike WoL, if you decide you need a different power, you not locked into a choice you made when starting out. By and large it works well  although obviously, unit upgrades are not available in multiplayer.     A hellion battle. Photograph: Games Press    And, of course, there&apos;s new units  a whole mess of them; from heavily armoured Aberrations to the brilliant Scourge Nests  basically a one-off fire-and forget missile battery to take down the new and improved Terran battlecruisers. Naturally, some fans may lament the passing of old favourites, but collectively the new additions make the Zerg a lot more fun to play; adding better attack and armour to their already superior aerial and defensive capabilities. However, Starcraft 2 has always been geared towards the multiplayer side, and this is where its true longevity lies. At the time of writing, I&apos;m still getting to grips with the new ranking system and how the new units balance out. However, clearly Starcraft remains a furiously competitive online experience  ostensibly now easier for noobs to find a decent match but still as passionately debated as ever. It remains to be seen how all this pans out  however, most of the new multiplayer maps look great; with Discord IV and Eternal Scar proving early favourites. So undoubtedly this is a great (if tardy) addition to the Starcraft legacy. The single player campaign can be breezed through on easy setting, but this doesn&apos;t detract from some truly massive levels, packed with multiple objectives and considerable replay value. And when you get to the bosses, the struggles are epic and gorgeously animated. Is HOTS as surprising and welcome as WoL once seemed? Maybe not  it basically looks and feels like the same game (not necessarily a bad thing), the story takes us nowhere particularly new and the bland voice acting has, if anything, has got worse. However, for RTS fans starved of major releases, PC fans increasingly abandoned for exclusive IPs and, of course, Starcraft fans in their millions, HotS is a massive slice of expertly crafted, beautifully balanced and totally tactical gameplay. Just don&apos;t make us wait so long for the final chapter, please!",

    "headline": "Why Songkick's new paternity policy is good for women", 
    "text": "There&apos;s a consensus among the entrepreneurs and technologists I talk to that many of the way to encourage more women into the industry is by challenging and changing the way a business operates, and often that means relatively subtle changes that will have a long-term impact.  Leaving aside the more fundamental crisis of IT education in schools (and how that fails to inspire and engage young people, and especially young women) there&apos;s a healthy rejection of the nauseating &apos;brogrammer&apos; culture in the tech industry in favour of something more inclusive that introduces parity. That&apos;s exactly what Songkick has just done by introducing an equal period of paternity leave for new fathers, which means they can take up to nine months off after their child is born.  The legal requirement is for two weeks, but Songkick offers six weeks&apos; paid leave and up to 46 weeks on top of that, explained co-founder Michelle You. The first time the company had to (hastily) draft a paternity and maternity policy was in 2008 when they only had a team of seven. The next Songkick baby is due in July this year. Songkick has a ratio of 25 men to six women on its staff, which is actually high for a tech startup. There&apos;s a subtle but significant shift in the decision to give parity to men and women equal leave. &quot;There&apos;s a mental block a lot of women have about their careers before they&apos;ve even got to the stage where they are ready to have children, so it is something that women think about and worry about more than men,&quot; said You. &quot;None of my male friends worry about what will happen to their careers when they have kids, but in particular there is this expectation on women to be a mum, stay at home and shoulder the responsibility of childcare.  &quot;That is reinforced by the unequal parental leave policy. If the mother can take nine months but the father can only take two weeks, then who is going to do it?&quot; Many young companies might worry about paying for this kind of policy, but You, co-founder Ian Hogarth and the rest of the Songkick team (who readily admit to be proud feminists) say they are lucky to be in a position to do this. &quot;It&apos;s normal, for example, for people who work at startups to have equity in the business,&quot; said Hogarth. &quot;We are good at establishing those kind of norms around how business is done and shifting expectations of how a business should treat you. Anything about gender [imbalance] is really hard to do, and there&apos;s a real latent misogyny in the startup space. Because there&apos;s no women in startups they have no voice for what should happen.&quot; Detour beta extended to all London Songkick users Elsewhere at Songkick, the trial of Detour, where fans pledge money to try and attract bands to play gigs, will be extended next week. Detour is currently limited to a private beta of 1,000 of Songkick&apos;s most hardcore muso fans in London, but not for long. Next Wednesday, it will be opened to the other 300,000 Songkick users in London.     Songkick is bringing over US comedian Aziz Ansari on the back of demand from users    So far, 206 Songkick users have pledged money to try and bring Japanese cult noise act Boredoms over from Japan, and American cellist Zoe Keating is now playing a 300-capacity gig in London in response to pledges on the site, despite being unsigned and only playing for a 50-person gig in London before. And Songkick is also testing the water with comedy, bringing Aziz Ansari over from the US to the Hammersmith Apollo. There&apos;s demand for Detour to expand into new cities but there&apos;s some foot leather involved in setting up the gigs, so the team aren&apos;t rushing to open the floodgates just yet. When they do, integration with Soundcloud and Spotify would follow. &quot;We&apos;re really concentrating on growing Detour out of Songkick right now,&quot; said Hogarth. &quot;It&apos;s Songkick with a edit card. Rather than telling us which bands they want to see, they say I really want to see this band and we make it happen.&quot;  It is happening in some numbers for Songkick more widely, with monthly user numbers now at 8 million. Ticketmaster claims 12 million, so I can&apos;t imagine it is too happy about that.",

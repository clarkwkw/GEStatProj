    "text": "Famed for its back catalogue of unforgiving PC games, developer Piranha Bytes surprised with a more accessible take on the RPG with the original iteration of Risen from two years ago. After they grafted a rum-soakedpiracy theme to its formula for Risen 2: Dark Waters, the game was released to mild acclaim on PC in April,with a transition to consoles in mind. A transition that, it would seem, did not go well. Technical problems abound, at leaston the PS3 version  the game looks five years old yet chugs and stutters throughout, marring what is essentially a solid, if unimaginative, role-playing adventure. There&apos;s plenty of content to keep players busy with a lengthy central quest, a refreshingly deep combat system and large, open world islands toexplore. But fatigue soon sets in thanks to a flat storyline, repetitive dialogue and a script that is, at best, witlessly profane.",

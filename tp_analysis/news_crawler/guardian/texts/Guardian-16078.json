    "text": "In a future where memories can be traded through a device called the Sensen, the amnesiac Nilin is waging a guerrilla war to bring down the corrupt corporation overseeing the technology. But when your entire recollection of an event can be rewritten with the flick of a switch, can anything be trusted? That&apos;s the question at the heart of Remember Me, Capcom&apos;s brilliant new cyberpunk adventure, one regularly asked by its innovative narrative technique of &quot;remixing&quot; key characters&apos; recollections, changing their view of the past to shift their actions in the present. Between posing philosophical and moral questions, it also offers a fantastic combat system and a visually stunning series of locations that demand to be explored. Unfortunately, linearity robs the game of true greatness, with every action, fight and remix rigidly scripted. A memorable experience, then, but one a sequel will, it&apos;s hoped, improve on.",

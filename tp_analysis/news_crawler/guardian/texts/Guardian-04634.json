    "text": "Some universities are letting students down by failing to warn them about plagiarism and its consequences until it is too late, says the official who deals with student complaints. The annual report of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA), due to be published on Thursday, is expected to show that complaints from students about harsh treatment by their universities over cheating have risen sharply in the past three years. Plagiarism is among the top three issues students complain about, along with their grades and assessment  by far the most common problem  and services such as teaching and facilities. The OIA&apos;s chief executive, Rob Behrens, says the problem of student &quot;academic misconduct&quot;, or cheating, appears to be growing. &quot;When I go round to universities I realise they are already dealing with significant amounts of academic misconduct that doesn&apos;t ever come to the OIA.&quot; According to Behrens, these complaints fall into three categories. &quot;Students say to us either: &apos;No one told me what the rules were&apos;, or &apos;I accept I broke the rules but the sanction is too severe,&apos; or &apos;The university didn&apos;t follow its own regulations and I didn&apos;t get a fair hearing.&apos;&quot; In one typical example, a student used notes from a website that publishes essays and was caught by his university. The work also included sentences identical to another student&apos;s from a previous year. The university decided this was a serious breach of its rules. Marks for the whole module were reduced to zero, which meant the student&apos;s degree classification also dropped. The student believed his punishment was too severe, but the adjudicator ruled against the student. The OIA, established in 2005, has legal power to make a judgment on students&apos; complaints in England and Wales once their university&apos;s internal procedures have been exhausted. Only a minority of complaints, including those about treatment over plagiarism, are upheld. But these often expose a need for improvements. In 2009, for example, a postgraduate student went to the OIA after a committee of two academic staff decided he&apos;d plagiarised in his dissertation and should receive a postgraduate diploma not a master&apos;s degree. Their meeting was held without telling the student or inviting him to attend. The OIA judged that the student had had no chance to defend himself and said the university&apos;s procedures should reflect principles of natural justice. Behrens says plagiarism among postgraduates is a growing concern. &quot;What we know is there is variable practice in different universities about how much assistance particularly a student writing a thesis can receive from their supervisor or from people they employ to help them write their thesis, and that is a road to ruin.&quot; This issue came to prominence last year when Lord Woolf led an inquiry after the London School of Economics accepted a 1.5m gift from a foundation headed by Saif Gaddafi, son of the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, six weeks after he had been awarded a PhD from the LSE. Although Gaddafi&apos;s degree was not revoked, Lord Woolf reported he did receive outside help with his PhD thesis without the knowledge of his academic supervisors. Gaddafi was in a position to pay experts to help him and this led Lord Woolf to urge universities to make sure students from &quot;highly privileged backgrounds who have a wealth of resources&quot; don not gain an unfair advantage. He recommended the LSE &quot;lay down guidance that is as precise as possible on what assistance is and is not appropriate for a postgraduate student to receive&quot;. Behrens, who gave evidence to the inquiry, says: &quot;There has to be much greater clarity about what is acceptable and not in terms of writing a thesis, scoping it, researching it, editing it  a whole range of things that tend not to be written down now need to be written down, otherwise particularly wealthy students are in a position to buy support that puts them at an advantage compared with non-wealthy students.&quot; Lord Woolf highlighted how the concept of plagiarism can vary across cultures. For example, imitation can be regarded as a form of flattery and respect. As Behrens told the inquiry, &quot;Chinese colleagues comment &apos;what you call plagiarism we call good practice&apos;, so you have to explain to people they can do X and they can&apos;t do Y. You can&apos;t just assume it is known. It also applies to British students. We can no longer have assumptions about what students know when they go to university.&quot; Behrens says universities should do more to communicate their rules, procedures and sanctions on plagiarism. And Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students agrees, especially to avoid &quot;accidental cheating&quot;, such as when a student has been unclear about when to cite a source. &quot;I&apos;d like to see more universities use the plagiarism software for student training as well as detection. Ifstudents can see what sets off the &apos;plagiarism alarm&apos; that helps. &quot;I also worry some academics are reluctant to stir up cases of minor plagiarism in a student&apos;s first year because they worry the repercussions might be severe, but if plagiarism goes unchecked early on, come the final year, a student can be in really hot water.&quot; Behrens urges continuing investment in both detection and prevention. &quot;Good students and universities have common cause here,&quot; he says. &quot;Where academic misconduct goes undetected it is hard working students who are disadvantaged by a small minority of their peers. Students and universities can bereassured we are not a soft option on this issue.&quot;",

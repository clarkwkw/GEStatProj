    "text": "When the Guardian&apos;s league table of universities comes out on Monday evening, we will then know how every higher education institution in the UK performed in the past year. Then on Tuesday morning, we release individual league tables for every subject taught at universities in the UK. Some of you will be wondering how it all works. What is the Guardian&apos;s special recipe to calculate the performance of universities and how do our tables differ from those of other guides? Others will be concerned to know how to use the tables to choose a place at university. Are the rankings the most important factor in deciding on a course? From 1-3pm on Tuesday, the compiler of the tables, Matt Hiely-Rayner from Intelligent Metrix, will be online to answer your questions and explain the lengthy process of consultation, categorisation and number-crunching that goes into putting these figures together each year. Recent research has shown that the Guardian tables are the &quot;most popular&quot; in the country, and have a significant impact on which courses students apply for. So the release of the figures each year is a nail-biting time for many university planners. While there is a lot of stability in the tables, some universities have leapt 10 or 20 places, others have seen their fortunes fall. Find out why by posting your questions below, and join in the discussion.  Matt Hiely-Rayner is the director of Intelligent Metrix Ruth Chapman is a careers adviser at the National Careers Service",

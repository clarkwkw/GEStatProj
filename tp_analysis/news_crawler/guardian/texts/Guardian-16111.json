Artisanal miners and large companies are hoping to cash inPhotograph: Guardian       Lotyang Sagal began digging for gold a few years ago, after his cattle were stolen by rustlers. Until recently, Karamoja was notorious for cattle rustling Photograph: Mark Tran/Guardian       Sagal will use the water from the jerry cans to sift for gold. He has been digging two holes for three years Photograph: Mark Tran/Guardian       Sagal uses basic hand tools for digging, which typically starts as early as 4am; three hours later, it is already warm. The holes are about 4.6 metres deep Photograph: Mark Tran/Guardian       The area is pockmarked with holes and mounds of earth, like a scene out of the film Caddyshack Photograph: Mark Tran/Guardian       Down the road, people gather for snacks and drinks.

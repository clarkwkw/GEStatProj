    "text": "As an expansive, high-fantasy RPG set in a sprawling world, Reckoning naturally invites comparison with Skyrim, and even the game&apos;s developers have acknowledged Bethesda&apos;s epic as a threat. But Reckoning is by no means an open world  its series of hubs linked by fixed paths create a far less believable, complete world. It is, however, a more visually diverse one, with Skyrim&apos;s endless snowscapes replaced by a colourful land that&apos;s often strikingly pretty. But the combat system is where Reckoning really sings. With three weapons, a shield and four magic spells to hand, which can be combined with dodges and charge moves, the fighting is both fluid and dynamic.",

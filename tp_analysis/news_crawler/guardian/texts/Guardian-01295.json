    "text": "It is just after dawn and the tall pines cast long, black lines of shadow across the open heath. Footpath pools are frozen, decorated with fine, feather-like creases formed in the ice overnight. At the edges of the heath, in the dense woods, woodpeckers drum and a song thrush carefully, deliberately, repeats its short phrases, as if practising for a music lesson. A carpet of curled brown fronds  the emaciated corpses of ferns  awaits resurrection in the spring. The dark brown heather, too, seems dead but, looking closely, there are signs of life: tiny, pale cream petals sprout on the stems. A sweet lilting song drifts through the cold air. Perched right at the top of one of the spindly pines that stand out in the middle of the heath is a small, sandy brown bird  a woodlark. Pure notes drip in a tuneful cascade: lilu-lilu-lilu-lilu-lilu. It sings again and again, subtly varying its soft yodel, and another woodlark answers, both welcoming the early morning sun. The duet is a duel, albeit extremely civilised, an early precursor to the territorial battles to come. Each winter the birds disperse, but not far, often feeding on nearby stubble fields, before returning in February to sing and display. Now red-listed, woodlarks declined by about 50% across the country in the past 25 years, because of the loss of and changes to the bird&apos;s habitat and winter feeding fields and harsh winters. Woodlarks mostly favour freshly cleared heathland or forest, moving to more suitable areas after four or five years as the vegetation matures again. The bird&apos;s recent resurgence on these greens and heathlands and elsewhere is thanks to constant conservation work (by the National Trust here) to maintain its preferred habitat, which benefits other local wildlife. Four woodlarks are singing today. As I walk back into the dark woods, their plaintive songs continue to ring out  a promise of the spring to come.",

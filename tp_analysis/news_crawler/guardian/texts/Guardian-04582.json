    "text": "One of the most popular app store titles, SpellTower (1.49, Zach Gage, iOS) has received a multiplayer update. What at first appears to be yet another word game soon becomes fantastically addictive with its mix of word-finding and Tetris. Letters fall from the top, the aim being to construct words from adjoining letters (those tiles then disappear). Words of five or more letters clear tiles around them, using a rare letter such as z clears the row, and each word can only be made once. There are different modes, from the simple &quot;tower&quot; to the more tactical &quot;puzzle&quot;, but basically, if the pile of letters reaches the screen&apos;s top it&apos;s game over. Now with bluetooth &quot;battle&quot; mode, forming words on your screen sends tiles descending upon your opponents  ruining their plans and taking you closer to victory. It makes for an even more compelling purchase.",

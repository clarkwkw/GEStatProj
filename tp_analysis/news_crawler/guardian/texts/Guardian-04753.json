    "text": "A report published in January called Liberating the NHS: Developing the Healthcare Workforce From Design to Delivery is about to shake up postgraduate healthcare training. Based on the work of the NHS Future Forum, a consultation begun under the last Labour government, the report recommends that there should be less focus on high-end research and a greater emphasis on disciplines such as statistics, economics, sociology, epidemiology and health policy. &quot;It&apos;s broadening narrow clinician-led practice with generic management skills to create training that is more appropriate for professional development,&quot; explains Dr Tim McHugh, graduate tutor for the faculty of medical sciences at University College London. Postgraduate degrees have always been the mainstay of career development for newly qualified doctors, as well as nurses and healthcare professionals in early to mid career. Most will study the MSc part-time or by distance learning while completing their hospital-based training. But the proposed overhaul of postgraduate courses is dividing opinion. Nearing the end of his medical training, junior doctor Syed Aftab of the Lister Hospital in Stevenage is studying for an MSc in trauma and orthopaedic surgery at the Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science at Stanmore. &quot;I regard my MSc as a fast track to a career as a hospital consultant. As part of my studies I&apos;m conducting research into body core stability, a commonly used medical term for which there is no precise definition.&quot; Quality research Aftab believes the master&apos;s degree is an essential first step in developing a doctor&apos;s specialist expertise. &quot;Any changes to the present MSc appear short-termist. The reason I decided to study for an MSc was because I was interested in opportunities for good-quality research. Everything we do as doctors is based around gathering supportive evidence,&quot; he says. Studying for an MSc in sports medicine, exercise and health at University College London (UCL), physiotherapist Terassa Taylor-Kaveney believes changes to healthcare training will be beneficial. &quot;The new system will make for smoother pathways for postgraduate education and promote a better service to hospital patients,&quot; she says. Kaveney, 31, began her career in the NHS and now works for a private clinic, the Princess Grace Hospital in London. She is paying 6,200 for her MSc and believes the qualification will pay dividends. &quot;The MSc covers advanced clinical assessment, athlete rehabilitation and injury prevention. The UCL MSc is a gold standard for working with top athletes, but a lot of the skills are transferable to the general public.&quot; To deliver the government&apos;s training objectives, health sector education will come under the remit of a new umbrella body, Health Education England. HEE will work alongside the General Medical Council and the royal colleges and be supported by Local Education and Training Boards (LETBs) who will deal directly with universities. Together, the HEE and the LETBs are responsible for the commissioning and quality of all new academic programmes. So how is this working on the ground? UCL has set up a new research and healthcare delivery alliance, UCL Partners, of which postgraduate education is a major component. UCL Partners includes major London universities and teaching hospitals including City University, Queen Mary, University of London, South Bank, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). UCL Partners has just signed a contract with its LETB, to deliver the medical and dental education commissioning system training programme to develop new postgraduate degrees. &quot;The purpose of setting up UCL Partners is to translate cutting-edge research and innovation into measurable health gain,&quot; says UCL&apos;s McHugh. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, a national centre of excellence for psychotherapy and member ofUCL Partners, has developed its postgraduate training around the needs of medical specialists and social care professionals. &quot;The way medical training is commissioned is rapidly evolving, and is becoming more integrated with the other healthcare disciplines,&quot; says director of medical education, Jessica Yakeley. &quot;Clinicians are working with researchers as part of a &apos;from bench-to-bedside&apos; approach, with an increasing linkage between research and practice.&quot; The Department of Health backed improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) programme is one example of changes within the NHS, in this case to provide approved therapies for common mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, at an early stage. These changes have generated not only more demand for training in, for example specific IAPT therapies, but for postgraduate training in more complex psychological treatments with the aim of delivering better outcomes for patients. &quot;We are training people in approaches that are more relevant across the whole healthcare spectrum, from primary healthcare to complex clinical interventions such as forensic psychotherapy,&quot; says Malcolm Allen, dean of postgraduate studies. More generic postgraduate courses prepare health service professionals to move into hospital or public heath administration. The LSHTM&apos;s MA in public health, for example, is essential for anyone building a career in health administration. &quot;Our MA looks at health services in general, evaluating their quality, efficiency and productivity,&quot; says Nick Black, professor in health service research at LSHTM. At a macro level we might be looking to see what lessons can be learned from other countries which have raised prescription charges, introduced GP health service commissioning or created a free market.&quot;",

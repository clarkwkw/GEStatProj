    "headline": "Can an upcycling expert transform my junk?", 
    "text": "Max McMurdo stands on the doorstep surrounded by toolboxes, neat as a pin. A professional upcycler, he has offered to convert my worst bits of household junk into brilliant new forms. Its hardly surprising that he is smiling: upcycling is a form of recreational optimism. The whole pursuit is underpinned by the belief that no tat is too tatty. All junk can be saved. McMurdo, 38, defines upcycling as adding emotional or financial value [to waste objects] through the addition of design. The idea has been around since at least the 1990s, and while the principle of adding value to waste makes sense, I have always disliked most of the interiors styles it has generated. Too often, upcycling bolts an adjective  such as shabby or industrial  to the word chic in the hope of rendering rubbish desirable. But maybe Max will change my mind. I take him on a tour of the house. Theres the mop with a sagging head, a warped tennis racket, a chair that cant be trusted, the set of metal shelves at the top of the stairs that belong to my husband and that Ive been trying to dump for at least 10 years. Theres even an old clothes airer that cant stand up. Thats definitely junk.     McMurdo considers how to make shelving from an abandoned rack. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian    Well, no, because thats quite exciting ... Youve got a lot of decent wire there. Wire is really in! McMurdo says, before launching into a discussion of caged lighting and caged storage. Ive also got a space hopper that lost a fight with a fox and lies crumpled in a muddy heap at the end of the garden. Maxs eyes light up. Have you really got a deflated space hopper? Thats all our childhood, isnt it? You must be able to keep the ears and face and stretch it over a frame or do something really cool and fun ... A little light behind it. Then it would glow with its wild ears! And so it goes on. The tennis racket could be a leg for a chair. The bit of plastic guttering would make a really cool birdbox. Upcycling is an act of faith. Whether you happen to be the one with the tools, the cash, the nous or the junk, the activity requires a total suspension of cynicism. Think of it as DIY theatre, with the upcycler as a sort of deus ex machina who will descend and fix all your unfixables. Certainly, McMurdo believes in the power of improvement; he too has been transformed by his hobby. Mid-project he sometimes stops and remembers the uninterested 15-year-old me at school and imagines how he would react to the adult Maxs upcycling ideas: Oh, I like that! I might design something! His personal uplift came in 2007 after he appeared on BBCs Dragons Den and secured funding for his company, reestore, from Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis (he has since bought the pair out). Clients for his high-end upcycled furniture include Google and the Body Shop. He also works as a broadcaster on shows such as Fill Your House For Free: this in itself is concerning because what I would really like to do is empty my house. His bathtub sofas sell for about 2,000.     Unloved metal shelves take shape as a candle-holder. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian    The first thing we need is to discuss what items you would like in your home, he says. We know what weve got to work with, now weve got to identify the items that would be most useful to you and your family. I would like McMurdo and his assistant, Nikkita, to take away the settee, with its holey cushions and wine-stained arms, and turn it into a version of Carl Malmstens round samsas sofa, but this seems a big ask. I could do with a picture frame for the kids school photo, I say. Some shelving for my daughters room. We are standing in the lounge. Something to put all these toys in. We carry all the junk into the garden. A big pile of stuff, McMurdo says approvingly. He plucks a metal hyacinth container from the grass. This just screams out to be a gorgeous lampshade, doesnt it? For your little boys room. I dont know what that fabric one is hes got in there. (Its from the Conran Shop.) Next, McMurdo lifts the collapsing chair and studies it mid-air. That chair would make a perfect towel rail and shelf for the bathroom, upside-down. I worry that it will just look like an upside-down chair stuck on the wall. McMurdo looks surprised. You dont want it to look repurposed? He wants to use timber dumped in the garden for some gorgeous shelves for my daughters room: Lots of little interlocking sections, quite organic. The hyacinth lampshade will go to her brother, along with a noticeboard made up of a crisscross of clothes-airer wires. Like an old 80s piece of artwork with string, says McMurdo. We can peg artwork on it. That just leaves something for the adults. Its nice to pick on this, he says, stroking the hideous metal shelves. Because you hate it so much. And because it is a genuine problem  there will be loads of them in the world. Most upcyclers wouldnt touch them. McMurdo believes upcycling could provide marriage therapy  For couples who hate each others possessions  although as he only got married last month, Im guessing he has yet to test this out. The person who hates it gets to work their magic on it, and thats the condition: you can keep it if we both fall in love with it. You have to admire his optimism, that upcycling your partners possessions could create marital harmony. But its worth a go  I give him the shelves. Soon the garden fills with makeshift workbenches. The air judders with the sound of the electric sander. A little wooden shelving unit that sat outside the shed is sawed into new lengths. The guts of the airer are snipped. A hole is drilled in the hyacinth pot. When the children, aged six and eight, return from school, each is given a saw. It is unclear who is happiest: the kids or McMurdo.     Paula shows off three completed items - a candle-holder, made from an unloved metal shelving unit; a lampshade for her son, made from a discarded plant pot; and shelving for her daughter made from an abandoned rack. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian    Something I didnt realise until very recently, he says, is that Im doing this completely for my mum and dad. They never had much money. It was a second marriage for both. So, they were starting again with nothing. When McMurdo was growing up, his father, who worked as an accountant, was known as the guy who jumped in skips. Everything was salvaged. He even straightened old nails. If they saved up for a toy car, it was basically an excuse for dad and I to go to the garage and build a wooden ramp system for the car to go round. Those times, learning how to use tools, were more enjoyable than the car itself. These adventures may be what McMurdo had in mind when he said that upcycling is about adding emotional value to worn things. It is clear that, for him, even the most emotional possessions are ripe for improvement. After his dad died, for instance, McMurdo inherited his old rugby boots. For a while they sat on display, but McMurdos partner had never met his father, and the boots moved to a box under the bed. Saddened to see them become a dust-collecting thing, he took the drill to one and turned it into a lamp. Some would shudder at this as an act of sentimental sabotage. But if you are an upcycler, you look to the future. Now, McMurdo is desperate to transform the other boot.     The finished candle-holder. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian    The garden swarms with sawdust, and finally the sander falls silent. My daughter is quietly staining her unit blue. It is not quite the interlocking maze I had envisioned; more like an asymmetrical noughts-and-crosses board. I am not keen, but she looks thrilled. She is so thoroughly invested in those shelves, it will be impossible ever to throw them away. The metal unit, on the other hand, has been significantly reduced  to a curved, metal candle foil about 20cm high. Sprayed copper, it stands on a bit of smoothed tree stump. We carry it inside, darken the lounge and light the candles. The hearth flickers with coppery warmth, and for a minute we are all transfixed by the glow, the wisp of flame through the little metal holes of what was once those hideous shelves. The kids lean in. Im still not sure about the aesthetic, but our spirits  our day  have been totally upcycled. McMurdo says he would sell the old-shelf candleholder, including the tree-stump base, for 90, or 45 without. (If youre interested, drop me a line.) After Max and Nikkita pack up and leave, my son finds a quiet moment to ask if he can have his old lampshade back; the hyacinth pot is deposited on a kitchen chair. A few weeks on, Im afraid its still there. The shelves lean against the wall in my daughters room awaiting a grandparental visit. The 80s art-style noticeboard, which was to be finished off-site, has yet to arrive. Out in the garden, the sad things I started with look even sadder. It turns out that one thing more rubbish than an airer that cannot stand is an airer that has no rails. But the worst surprise awaits at the top of the stairs. Apparently, the candle-holder only required the removal of the back panel of the metal shelves, so the rest of the unit lives to fight another decade. Still, we are all upcyclers now. We must make the best of things. Upcycling: 20 Creative Projects Made from Reclaimed Materials by Max McMurdo is published by Jacqui Small (20). Click here to buy it for 16.40.",

    "text": "Angry Birds maker Rovio has announced what we already know to be true: this game is huge, with 648 million of us now exploding bricks, ice and glass in the hope that the pigswill die. But if you think you&apos;ve overdone it with those porkylittle fellas, here are five alternative games: 1. Plants v Zombies You&apos;ve got a lovely garden, but zombies are threatening to invade it and eat your brains. Stop them with pea-shooting plants. 2. Temple Run Avoid being devoured by unidentified snarling monsters. 3. Pigs in Trees Here pigs can fly. And they have to kill birds. Wonder where they got this idea from? 4. Fruit Ninja Slice and dice flying fruit against the clock. The most exercise your finger will ever have. 5. Tiny Tower Build a skyscraper and fill it with tenants whom you have to keep gainfully employed. If you don&apos;t, they&apos;ll moan about you on their Facebook pages. Yes, characters in apps now have their own Facebook pages.",

    "text": "Going off to university gives students the opportunity to move out of home and into halls  and the chance to make their own decisions free of parental authority. For many, the experience is thrilling. But it is not suitable for everyone, which is why many students choose to commute. At Oxford Brookes University, a travel survey for 2012 found that almost a quarter (24.1%) of students travelled more than 10 miles to get to campus, while more than a third (34%) took journeys lasting longer than 30 minutes. These figures may seem surprisingly high, but with the increase in tuition fees and the rising costs of living, they are likely to grow. Of course financial pressures are not the only reason students opt to travel significant distances to university. Helen Jenkins, who studies English and Japanese, decided to commute to Oxford Brookes after suffering from depression in her first year. Helen, who comes from Brighton, explains: &quot;I decided to move to London to be closer to Brighton, in a &apos;middle ground&apos;. This way I can attend the university that has the joint degree course I have wanted to do since I was 15.&quot; The question of degree availability is vital. Less popular subjects aren&apos;t taught at all institutions. Students who are tied geographically by family commitments are left with little choice but to travel considerable distances to pursue their studies. Moreover, first-year students who fail to get a place in halls, or got a last-minute university place through clearing, are often forced to commute  at least in the beginning. Having lived in student accommodation in my first year, I opted to commute from London to Oxford in my second. I am fully aware of the pros and cons of being a teenage coach commuter. While I adore my course, &quot;student life&quot; wasn&apos;t for me. Though I now have all my home comforts, it is important to stress that living at home is not the easy option. I endure a journey that takes several hours out of my day, have less time to socialise, and am an awfully long way away from the university library. While I made the decision to commute myself, for others it is the only option. Despite tuition and maintenance loans, many students are still heavily reliant on parental support. Loans are awarded on household income, but parents have their own mortgages and bills to pay. I estimate my travel will have cost me 1,000 by the end of the year. This isn&apos;t cheap, but it is considerably less than the cost of renting a property and having to worry about all the bills that come with it. Students are finding a variety of solutions to the problem of high rentals: some have decided to study by distance learning, for example, through the Open University, while others are doing degrees at local further education colleges. The more adventurous are opting to study in Europe, where education is cheaper, though the cost of travelling back and forth to Britain soon cuts into their savings. The commuting option can be physically and emotionally draining. Some try it and decide getting up before sunrise simply isn&apos;t worth it. Nicole Voak, who studies film at London Metropolitan, told me: &quot;Commuting only works if the commuter is very dedicated. Most of the commuters in my class at uni only show up for the afternoon lectures, if that.&quot; While many students scrimp and save to continue living in a new environment, for others staying at home is more suitable. Whether for personal, health or financial reasons, commuting provides an alternative approach to student life.",

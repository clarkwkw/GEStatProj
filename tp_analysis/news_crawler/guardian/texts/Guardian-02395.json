    "text": "Nasa&apos;s Curiosity rover is performing well on its way to a touchdown in Mars&apos;s Gale crater on 6 August, but the plans for future major missions to the planet have been thrown into confusion. Nasa was to partner Europe in two ExoMars missions in 2016 and 2018, providing the launch rockets, suites of instruments and, in the case of the 2018 venture, the expertise to deliver another sizeable rover to the surface. President Obama&apos;s proposed federal budget for the year from this October, though, shows Nasa&apos;s budget for planetary exploration being squeezed by the competing big-ticket demands of the delayed James Webb Space Telescope, now likely to be launched no earlier than 2018, and the mandate to support future human exploration and space technology. The budget cancels Nasa&apos;s ExoMars involvement, and leaves Europe struggling to fill the gaps, perhaps by involving Russia&apos;s Roscosmos. A Russian rocket could launch the 2016 ExoMars, delivering a small static lander and an orbiting craft to investigate whether methane detected in the Martian atmosphere comes from Martian life or geological activity. But Russia has no experience in landing on Mars, and its record of failed Mars missions does not instill confidence. Nasa, meanwhile, still intends to send a small Mars-orbiter, Maven, late next year to study the Martian atmosphere, and is considering its own cheaper mission to Mars for 2018. ",

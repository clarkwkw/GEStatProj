    "text": "The education secretary, Michael Gove, is facing a growing rebellion from teachers and architects over plans to simplify new school buildings after a study claimed well-designed classrooms could improve pupils&apos; progress in lessons by as much as 25%. Lord Rogers, the architect of buildings ranging from the Pompidou Centre in Paris to Mossbourne academy in Hackney, east London, has urged the government to rethink its policy for the procurement of 2.5bn worth of new schools and &quot;for the sake of the next generation&quot; heed evidence that school environments affect pupil performance. Deborah Saunt, an award-winning school designer, has also announced that her firm is boycotting the government&apos;s plan to build 261 replacement primary and secondary schools, describing simplified design guidelines as the architectural equivalent of feeding children McDonald&apos;s every day. This autumn Gove ordered a ban on curves in a new generation of no-frills school buildings ,in response to what he calls a decade of wasteful extravagance in educational architecture. The first contracts will be awarded in April in a programme of new schools that will be 15% smaller than those built under the previous government&apos;s over-budgeted and delayed Building Schools for the Future programme. Gove&apos;s decision to squeeze space for corridors, assembly halls and canteens means building costs could be slashed by 30%, saving up to 6m a school. Folding internal partitions to subdivide classrooms, roof terraces that can be used as play areas, glazed walls and translucent plastic roofs are banned. The first schools designed to the new rules are due to open in September 2014. However, the initial findings of a study by academics at Salford University showed a strong correlation between the built environment where teaching takes place and test results in reading, writing and maths. Lighting, circulation, acoustics, individuality and colour were revealed to affect pupils&apos; progress in the year-long study of achievement by 751 children in seven primary schools in Blackpool. It found eight out of 10 environmental factors displayed significant correlations with the pupils&apos; performance and the report&apos;s authors concluded: &quot;This clear evidence of the significant impact of the built environment on pupils&apos; learning progression highlights the importance of this aspect for policymakers, designers and users.&quot; Gove has dismissed the significance of the findings. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: &quot;There is no convincing evidence that spending enormous sums of money on school buildings leads to increased attainment. An excellent curriculum, great leadership and inspirational teaching are the keys to driving up standards.&quot; &quot;This study confirms what our practice has long believed,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;Good design has the potential to have a truly positive effect on the way children learn. Mossbourne is a striking piece of evidence: high in the league tables and with staff and pupils commenting enthusiastically about the impact of the school&apos;s careful design. We proved it is possible to produce a well-designed school collaboratively with the senior teaching staff which adheres to a tight budget. Gove is making it unneccessarily difficult to design good schools.&quot; The Royal Institute of British Architects has said it is seriously concerned the government&apos;s proposed &quot;flat-pack&quot; approach &quot;will place a straitjacket on future generations of teaching professionals and quickly render these schools redundant&quot;. It added: &quot;The designs for secondary schools include narrow corridors and concealed stairs that are difficult to supervise. In many schools this is likely to result in the need for additional staff supervision to maintain good behaviour and avoid bullying.&quot; The Salford academics hypothesised that three principles of environmental design would most affect brain function among pupils: how &quot;natural&quot; it felt to be in the room, the extent to which the room felt individual to its occupants, and whether it stimulated them. Testing the theory against academic results, they found the most significant design factor appeared to be how well the school allowed pupils to flow through it. Good design of &quot;connections&quot;  wide and uncluttered corridors with easy orientation and landmarks, rooms that are quickly accessible from the main entrance, and proximity of classrooms to places such as the library, music room and cafe  accounted for a quarter of the positive impact on learning progression that the built environment can have. Colour was the next most important factor, followed by complexity of design, where less was more, and flexibility, where more was better. Light levels and the degree to which a classroom and its furniture was designed to foster a sense of &quot;this is our classroom&quot; ownership and familiarity in the pupils were the fifth and sixth most effective factors affecting educational performance. The desire for natural light was combined with a dislike of glare and a desire for good artificial light. Among the other positive factors were even underfloor heating and windows and doors that opened wide to allow the buildup of soporific carbon dioxide to escape. The results were not always as expected. The results of Sats tests suggested less rather than more colour and complexity in classroom design was better for pupil performance. &quot;Young children may like exciting spaces, but to learn it would seem they need relatively ordered spaces, but with a reasonable degree of interest,&quot; the authors said. The British Council for School Environments, a charity whose backers include teachers, governors and architects, has described the Salford study as &quot;very significant&quot;. Chief executive Sharon Wright said it was &quot;lobbying for schools to have a real say in the design and to be listened to, to ensure the designs are right for them.&quot; A DfE spokesman defended the standard school designs, insisting they &quot;will provide light, bright and airy learning environments for pupils and were drawn up jointly with architects and teaching experts to make the very best use of space&quot;.",

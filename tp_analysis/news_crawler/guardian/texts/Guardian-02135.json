    "text": "Oke Okaro is global head of mobile at Bloomberg, having joined in 2010 from a similar role at ESPN. His job: to help fulfil the company&apos;s stated aim to deliver &quot;essential news information and tools&quot; for businesses and financial executives. &quot;That broad mission is platform-agnostic: we are committed to doing that across every platform, and doing it in a way that is optimal for each platform, including mobile,&quot; he says. &quot;Mobile is changing consumer expectations, changing the way people interact with content, and most importantly changing their expectations around that content.&quot; Since joining Bloomberg, Okaro has worked on the launch of Business Week&apos;s iPad app in early 2011, as well as iPad app Bloomberg TV+ and iPhone app Bloomberg Radio+ later that year. One of the interesting features of the latter is the ability to see biographies of radio guests, market data and charts as they are referenced during a show or interview on the screen, while listening. &quot;It makes sense because it enriches the experience in a way that&apos;s very natural,&quot; says Okaro. &quot;We are connecting both worlds [radio and app] in a very organic way, and I think quite frankly that in the future this is how radio and television will be consumed.&quot; Ah, second-screen apps, although Okaro uses the term &quot;companion experiences&quot;  an area he has been exploring since his days at ESPN. He sees great potential in this, particularly if what&apos;s happening on the second screen is &quot;programmed&quot; to synchronise with what the user is watching or listening to. &quot;You&apos;ll have someone on the air who&apos;s using an interactive tool to provide a specific perspective or point, and you&apos;ll be able to do this yourself if you have the product,&quot; he says. &quot;These tools are going to be transportable across platforms, and the companion screen is going to be a very important screen, if you have programmed a companion experience to complement the show.&quot; One benefit these apps are having for Bloomberg is to extend the company&apos;s reach Okaro says that 40% of the people who use the Bloomberg TV+ app are new to the service, rather than existing viewers on other platforms. The company has also been running surveys and digging into the data provided by usage of its apps to gauge what features people are using most, and how this might affect the apps&apos; evolution in the coming months. A key lesson: &quot;What people really want is greater personal relevance from a content experience: they want the ability to more effectively tailor the experience to meet their specific needs,&quot; says Okaro. &quot;With the amount of content that we have on the news, data and tools sides, certain combinations of that make sense with different audiences. One size fits all does not work, especially on smartphones when people want to get to what they care about very quickly and easily.&quot;     The Bloomberg Radio+ app shows charts and biographies while people listen    Bloomberg is not purely focused on apps when it comes to mobile: its mobile website is thriving. That&apos;s due to a deliberate strategy of focusing just as much on mobile web as on native apps, as Okaro explains. &quot;We think it is essential to have content across every device, and we can do that by having a great mobile website,&quot; says Oke Okaro, global head of mobile at Bloomberg. &quot;Then we see a role for apps to give us another point of discovery in terms of being in the app stores, and also to deliver an experience that is slightly richer than you can provide in a mobile website. We think that both will co-exist.&quot; In fact, they are already. Okaro says that Bloomberg currently sees 7.8m unique users across its mobile products every month, with 3m of those coming from apps. He outlines why the mobile website attracts so much traffic, starting with search. &quot;Whenever anyone runs a search on a mobile device and taps on a link from Bloomberg.com, it brings them to the mobile website, and whenever someone taps on a link that has been shared on Twitter, we bring up the mobile website,&quot; he says. &quot;And, of course, if you go to Bloomberg.com from the browser, you get the mobile website. There are a number of ways people discover content, and the content available in apps is not yet being indexed in the same way as the web is being indexed. You have to have a great mobile web experience.&quot; When it comes to native apps, Bloomberg prioritises platforms based on their overall scale, and their critical mass among its audience in the latter case, that critical mass may be current, or Bloomberg may believe it will happen in the future, and wants to get in early. Over time, Okaro believes that any debate about native apps versus mobile web will fade away, as companies get smarter about targeting both. &quot;It&apos;s all about reaching your audience in whichever way your audience chooses to consume your content,&quot; he says. &quot;Over time, the two worlds will coincide. People will end up with about 80% of their app being built in HTML5, and the rest being built in native, which will make going from one platform to the next a much more palatable process.&quot; That may spell good news for Windows Phone-owning Bloomberg users. Okaro says he is very impressed by Nokia&apos;s latest Lumia smartphones, and Microsoft&apos;s work on the Windows Phone user interface. &quot;I like Nokia&apos;s hardware, and I think both Nokia and Microsoft are clearly committed to this,&quot; he says. &quot;There are some things it doesn&apos;t support today, like fast-switching between apps and various other things they&apos;ll need to address. But I think it&apos;s going to do very well.&quot;",

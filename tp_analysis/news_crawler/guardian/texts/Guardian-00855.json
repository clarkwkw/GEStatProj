Since I postponed my morning science video this morning to share my thoughts on SOPA/PIPA, here is the morning video, a little later than usual and with one change: it&apos;s not a science video. Instead, it&apos;s one of my favourite YouTube meme videos, a video that has been adapted to comment on SOPA/PIPA legislation. It is wonderfully satirical and informative but at the same time, it is probably in some vague and not-yet-determined way in violation of SOPA/PIPA rules, should either of those dumbass bills pass next week:               Visit FightingInternet&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  I especially loved the line: &quot;Don&apos;t cry, Disney owns the rights to that emotion.&quot; .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

    "text": "   Bryony Duncan, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    Working for Fight for Peace (FFP), the view of sustainable development that I have is about engaging with young people (and with the people/organisations that support them) to encourage them to be the leaders of the future. FFP&apos;s theory of change is about building people&apos;s knowledge and skills to support them to make a difference in their own lives, and therefore make a difference in all our lives. This means that we hear their voices; we share information with them; we share responsibility with them; we take risks with them; we have the expectation that they will rise to the challenge of making decisions that will benefit others. This would be my message to Rio+20  to try to avoid a &quot;them and us&quot; perspective and realise that what &quot;they&quot; do affects &quot;us&quot;, and what &quot;we&quot; do affects &quot;them&quot;. We use boxing and martial arts combined with personal development, working in areas affected by crime and violence, and have many amazing stories of young people who have risen to the challenge and made positive changes that affect them and their communities. We are now sharing our experiences in a new global programme, training 120 other community-based organisations worldwide who work with young people in similar contexts, with the aim that they will be able to make faster and better progress than we have. There&apos;s no them and us. There&apos;s a common challenge, and a common desire, and we believe it&apos;s about working together. Fight for Peace was founded in the Complexo da Mar favelas of Rio de Janeiro in 2000 before also opening in North Woolwich, London in 2007",

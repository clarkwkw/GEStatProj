    "text": "With its open, stealth-based gameplay and beautifully realised steampunk setting, Dishonored is one of the most hotly anticipated games of the year. And whispers coming from game critics who&apos;ve played the finished code suggest that it is going to be every bit as astonishing as we&apos;ve all hoped. To mark the launch on 12 October, the Guardian has teamed up with publisher Bethesda to arrange an absolutely unmissable event. On 3 October, the game&apos;s art director Sebastien Mitton and visual design director Viktor Antonov will be coming to the Guardian offices to talk about the design concepts behind the stunning visuals. After a presentation on the art of Dishonored, I&apos;ll be holding a Q&amp;A session with the duo followed by audience questions.  And that&apos;s not all. Those attending will also be able to browse a gallery of concept art and designs taken from throughout the development process. And visitors will get the chance to win an exclusive piece of art, created especially for the night by the Dishonored team.  This is a unique chance to meet the creative minds behind the biggest original game of 2012. The event will take place in the Scott Room at Guardian HQ in King&apos;s Cross. Doors will open at 6.45pm and the event will start at 7pm sharp. Food and drink will be served after the presentations and tickets costs 8. With only 80 places available, you&apos;ll need to move fast. You can book your place right here.",

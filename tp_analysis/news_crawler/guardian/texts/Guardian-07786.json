    "text": "The Ofqual cap on English grades is not about raising standards but changing the way standards are measured (Fury over GCSE downgrade, 23 August). It is a return to the days of O-levels, where a percentage of candidates were allocated to each grade. Rightwing educationalists have long argued covertly the exam system should select students for university and top positions rather than recognise achievement. I have no problem in raising standards by making a qualification harder. Spell out the standards expected for each grade so students can be taught the required knowledge. If more students than expected reach these standards, it should be cause for celebration, not evidence of grade inflation. As well as changing the rules of the game, Michael Gove has reintroduced O-levels through the back door.James Whiting Deputy head, Chiswick School, London    There appears to be a lack of understanding of the processes of assessment used in exams. There are two important methodologies; norm referencing and criterion referencing; that are, or should be, mutually exclusive. Norm referencing is predicated on the assumption that there will be, from year to year, the same proportion of excellent performances, graded down to failures, so that the exam can be set and marked and then grade boundaries chosen to reflect that assumption. Setting and marking such an exam is relatively easy to do, but makes it impossible to demonstrate any improvement (or deterioration) in learning over the years and is open to manipulation for ideological reasons  emphasis of the achievements of a small elite. Remember Gore Vidal&apos;s dictum, &quot;It is not enough to succeed, others must fail&quot;. Criterion referencing demands that an exam test with accuracy achievement measured against a carefully selected set of criteria. It should be independent of the number of candidates and of when the test is set. This is difficult to do: how do you ensure two exams set in different years are of the same difficulty? Unfortunately, politicians pretend to criterion referencing when what is really happening is disguised norm referencing, and use the outcomes to support action dictated by their ideology. Lemuel IbbotsonWalsall  Congratulations to our young people. As I watch them walking around earnestly clutching the envelope containing their GCSE results, I am reminded how statistically life is much harder for them and they have done much better than those of us from older generations.Kathleen O&apos;Neill Hayling Island, Hampshire  That GCSE results are down this year should surprise no one. Michael Gove intended that to happen. His declared intention is to have all schools in England contracted to him as academies. Bribing them to become, in effect, government schools is proving increasingly expensive. Force is far cheaper. The way to exert that is to pull some minimum GCSE standard out of the air and require all schools that do not reach it to become an academy. The way to increase the number of schools failing to reach that standard is to make it more difficult to reach. Hence the lower results this year. Peter NewsamPickering, North Yorkshire  After five years of preparation, some children have not got the grades they wanted in their English GCSE. Thank you, Ofqual for moving a boundary so thousands of young people can have their dream snatched away, thus teaching them a valuable lesson about life. Now it&apos;s time for another government watchdog to step up to the plate. The as yet relatively unknown Ofgames has been set up to ensure Olympic standards are maintained. I can&apos;t have been the only one to be worried at the rapid rise in the number of gold medals? There has to be something dodgy going on. It can&apos;t all be down to the hard work of the athletes and their coaches. Don&apos;t we need to look back to the golden age of the Los Angeles Games to appreciate the true value of a gold? Time for the record boundaries to be raised and records reassessed. OK, that would mean many athletes have their dreams dashed but hasn&apos;t Ofqual shown us the way to inspire a generation?Geoffrey ThomasDeputy head, Reddish Vale Technology College, Stockport, Cheshire",

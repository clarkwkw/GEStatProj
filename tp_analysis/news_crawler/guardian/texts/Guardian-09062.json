    "text": "Last year, the GameCity festival launched its own annual prize, seeking to discover the most interesting titles from across the entire industry. The winner was Minecraft, beating the likes of Portal 2, Limbo and Child of Den.  It&apos;s a very different sort of games award. There are no gamer votes and no industry insiders on the judging panel. Instead, a &apos;secret academy&apos; creates a long list (helped in part by public suggestions), which is then shortened before being played an assessed by an eclectic panel that this year includes film producer David Puttnam, comic book artist David Gibbons, comedian and author Charlie Higson and radio presenter Jo Whiley. And the seven titles they&apos;ll be looking at were confirmed today. They are:  Catherine - Atlus Persona GamesFez - PolytronJohann Sebastian Joust - Die Gute FabrikJourney - thatgamecompanyMass Effect 3 - BiowareProteus - Ed Key and David KanagaSuper Mario 3D Land - Nintendo EAD &quot;Personally, I think it&apos;s a more balanced list than last year,&quot; says festival director, Iain Simons. &quot;This isn&apos;t an award for &apos;indie&apos; games, just brilliant games, so it&apos;s really nice to see some AAA work alongside the kinds of projects people might expect to see in something like this. &quot;We&apos;re asking which are the games you&apos;d show to someone in order to demonstrate what&apos;s brilliant and interesting about video games. We want to encourage diversity  we&apos;re looking to show the breadth of what videogames are. Each game is there on it&apos;s own merits, but this year I know the academy also wanted to create the most interesting mix they could too. It&apos;s not just about the best game, it&apos;s about how we can help a non-specialist jury have the most interesting discussion too&quot;.  And discussions are already beginning about the long list titles that didn&apos;t make the final cut. The like of Dark Souls, DayZ and Skyrim were all ejected. Simons is more than happy if the shortlist selection generates debate. &quot;I think one of our key focus points for the prize moving forward is how we expose and explore those discussion moving forward. This isn&apos;t really about which is the best videogame. It&apos;s a story about how different people decide which is the best videogame - for me, that&apos;s what we need to work hard to explore more.  &quot;There are plenty of events that rely on some hidden critical discussion, and then some democracy to work out who&apos;s best. I want us to be more about the journey, and in doing so  by virtue of the kinds of people who are on it  also be about the place of videogames in mainstream culture&quot;. There has also been some controversy about the judging panel, specifically the use of non-industry people. &quot;We&apos;ve had a couple of bits of very negative response from quite senior people within the games industry this year about the decision to use &apos;non-specialist&apos; judges, in particular that it would really prejudice their ability to understand the nominated projects at all,&quot; says Simons. &quot;Disappointingly, they didn&apos;t take their discontent public, which would have been helpful really - as it&apos;s another important part of the conversation.  &quot;The problem is, videogame culture is such a weird, crazy, conflicted thing. On the night of the jury meeting in London, a peer of the realm was playing Joust with the co-creator of Watchmen and Charlie Higson - having an impassioned, positive discussion about videogames which they&apos;d just discovered. Just down the road poor Rupert Loman, also attempting to do something totally positive, is having to pull leggings onto hired young women at the Eurogamer Expo. Funny old world, innit?&quot; Indeed it is, but then the industry is only going to become more complicated as game audiences widen, as digital culture becomes ever more pervasive and as new game types emerge on nascent platforms. That&apos;s part of the reasoning behind the prize, I suspect, and part of the reason it is so interesting.  Anyway, the winner will be announced at the end of the GameCity festival which takes place later this month.",

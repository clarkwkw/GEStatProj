    "text": "At long last the sun is shining, but despite the weeks of relentless wind, rain and gloomy skies, some of our native wildflowers actually managed to thrive. One of the biggest surprises was a bumper year for wild orchids, with some of our most exotic-looking native flowers, such as bee orchids, twayblades, pyramidal, fragrant and spotted orchids all putting on glorious displays. The weather was also kind to some of Britain&apos;s rarest orchids, including the monkey and lady orchids and their hybrids growing at the Aston Clinton Ragpits in the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire. The thing is that orchids prefer warm and dry conditions in well-drained soils, so why did they do so well this year? It&apos;s thought the weather earlier this year helped  the mild winter and warm, dry early spring gave the orchids such a boost they overcame the appalling conditions this summer. In fact, bee orchids enjoy such warm and dry conditions they are more common in Mediterranean countries, which is partly why large numbers of the plants are found in the warm climate of south-east England. But as the climate warms across the UK, these orchids have been spreading northwards and can now be found in southern Scotland. The numbers of bee orchids are also increasing because they can grow on derelict industrial land. The Natural History Museum is keen for the public to record sightings of bee orchids at its website http://bit.ly/ORwJ2f.",

    "text": "Re-releasing old titles as apps can be a boon for developers and gamers  if done sensibly. Pricing a 13-year-old title at 7.99 is going to appeal to nobody (the recent SoulCalibur for example)  but a year-old underplayed gem can be given a new lease of life. Engaging puzzler Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective (iOS, Capcom) does just that, offering the first couple of chapters free, with the entire game just 6.99. Placing you in the ghostly shoes of detective Sissel, the task is to solve a series of murders, linked by one entertaining narrative. When Sissel interacts with the deceased he travels four minutes into their past, whence he can possess inanimate objects, using them to save the victims&apos; lives. Those four minutes can be replayed over and over until the solution becomes apparent. It&apos;s surprisingly linear  with a single correct answer per case  yet absorbingly inventive, and packed full of interesting characters to keep you glued to the screen.",

    "text": "In response to your coverage of the forced conversion of Haringey primary schools to academy status (Report, 5 January), the Department for Education has misrepresented a complex situation in claiming that &quot;Haringey&apos;s primary schools are the worst performing in inner London&quot;. The truth, as the department has only to check with their government colleague, Liberal Democrat MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, Lynne Featherstone, is that for years now Haringey has been classified as an outer London borough for funding purposes and, as a consequence, schools have received around 1,500 per pupil less than schools in the boroughs with which the department compares Haringey, such as Hackney, Camden and Southwark. Ms Featherstone has for some time now, quite commendably, been running a highly public campaign to correct this inequality. Perhaps, rather than seeking to gamble with the futures of Haringey children for dogmatic reasons and where the evidence does not support such heavy-handed intervention, the Department for Education could allow for all Haringey&apos;s schools to be funded properly, in line with those of Camden, Southwark and Hackney etc, and only then assess whether those schools are underperforming in comparison to their peers in other boroughs. At the very least, can we hope for Lynne Featherstone to step forward and clarify the implied slander on Haringey&apos;s schools flowing from the misrepresentation in the statement from the Department for Education, given that her constituents have long been told how close to her heart this issue is?Rob MurrowLondon ",

    "text": "Price 19,745MPG 78.5Top speed 118mph Despite the fact that doomsayers delight in filling our heads with morbid premonitions of lethal epidemics, environmental catastrophes and meteorite strikes, the odds are that our final undoing will be far more mundane. Today the four horsemen of the apocalypse are Heart Disease, Cancer, Stroke and RTA (road traffic accident). Unless you happen to be a Volvo driver, in which case you only need to worry about the first three horses. The Swedish car builder can&apos;t do anything about your genetics or your diet, but the corporation&apos;s ambitious target, according to Thomas Broberg, its chief safety officer, is that by 2020: &quot;Nobody will ever die or be seriously injured in anew Volvo.&quot; In an accident, he should have added. Even Volvo can&apos;t stop you having a heart attack at the wheel. It&apos;s an amazing claim, but the remarkable thing is that Volvo is well on its way to &quot;death-proofing&quot; its cars. Take the strikingly sleek Volvo V40. The car is a class act when it comes to safety exams  it received the top rating of five stars in its Euro NCAP collision tests, and its overall result is the best ever recorded for adult protection. It is, officially, the safest car on the road. But here&apos;s the irony. As Iread through its mind-bogglingly comprehensive list of active and passive safety systems, I began to feela growing sense of panic. A sort of paranoic unease. If driving really isthis hazardous, should we be driving at all? Swallowing hard, I strapped myself in and bravely went for a drive (come on, Martin, you can do it), deciding to trust my life to Volvo&apos;s armoury of whiplash protectors, airbags, rollover cage, inflatable curtains, pre-crash preparation systems, laser-based city safety braking units, auto brakes, pedestrian detection systems, lane-keeping aides, rear cross-traffic detectors, intelligent cruise control and blindspot warning features. Rather than sitting in a car I felt as if Iwas at the centre of a Roman infantry &quot;tortoise&quot; bristling with spears and interlocking shields. And it all worked. I survived. But it&apos;s not just the driver that Volvo cares about. The V40 also boasts the world&apos;s first pedestrian airbag. Veer into someone and a pyrotechnic charge blows the bonnet&apos;s hinges, which then raises it to deflect them from the windscreen while simultaneously activating an airbag to cushion their impact with the engine. The V40 is the first Volvo to be produced since Ford sold the marque to the Chinese carmaker Geely. It&apos;s a great-looking vehicle: broad, low-slung and curvaceous, with attractive deep creases at the front and sculpted headlamps. The rear seats are a little cramped and the boot is not massive, yet the interior still feels light and uncluttered. It may be a Chinese car but it still has that Skandi feel to it. There is a real sense that you have joined the premium sector  where else can you change the colour of the digital dashboard to suit your mood? Enginewise there&apos;s a decent selection, from a parsimonious 1.6- litre turbodiesel which does awallet-sedating 78mpg up to a range of zesty5-cylinder petrol units which drink a little more and party a little harder. But all of them promise to get you home in one piece.

GEM Motoring Assist, the road safety organisation and breakdown cover company, has produced a YouTube video called Blue Light Aware which provides road-users with vital information to help an emergency service driver on a blue light run. Based on Highway Code advice, the video specifically addresses situations that can cause confusion or panic for motorists. The five-minute video features emergency service representatives and road safety professionals talking through scenarios and explaining how motorists should deal with them. The aim of the video is to ensure that blue light drivers, on their way to attend emergency situations, can get there as safely and quickly as possible, with the help of fully informed motorists. Watch the video  it&apos;ll help you to get into the right place at the right time  and will help the emergency services face as few hazards as possible. Dangerous roads for cyclists And while we are thinking of danger on the roads, be sure to watch The War on Britain&apos;s Roads, which is on BBC One at 9pm on Wednesday 5 December. It combines footage captured by cyclists through helmet-mounted cameras, with interviews from cyclists, drivers and those affected by incidents on our roads. Viewers are parachuted into the middle of the battle that is raging between two-wheeled road users and their four-wheeled counterparts. As 34m vehicles and 13m bikes all try to share the same crowded space, The War on Britain&apos;s Roads provides a dramatic and unique insight into the unfolding tension and conflict. The film presents both sides of the story, retelling dramatic incidents from both the cyclists&apos; and drivers&apos; points of view. Let&apos;s hope it teaches us all to treat fellow road-users with more respect.",

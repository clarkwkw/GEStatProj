Apple iPhone now nearly 25% of China&apos;s smartphone market, but Android&apos;s growing faster &gt;&gt; Tech In Asia  Kantar says Apple hit 23.2% of China&apos;s smartphone market in January, up from 18.6% in September 2012. But Android saw even more impressive growth, jumping from 65.2% of the market in September to 71.5% of it in January. The big losers, unsurprisingly, were everyone else. Symbian and Windows Phone both dropped (to 3.5% and 1.2%, respectively) and other OSes didn&apos;t even register.  Smartphone penetration is only 22%; plenty of room to grow. Also, these are shipments rather than installed base. In the Clouds: Inventing Chromebook &gt;&gt; Jeff Nelson An ex-Googler:   Here&apos;s a few interesting tidbits about the invention of Chromebook. First, Chromebook was initially rejected by Google management. In fact I wrote the first version as early as July 2006 and showed it around to management. Instead of launching a project, the response was extremely tepid. My boss complained, &quot;You can&apos;t use it on an airplane.&quot; Actually, you could as, under the covers, it was still a bare-bones Linux distribution and could execute any Linux program installed on it. Second, Google OS was not originally written for Chrome or called &quot;Chrome OS&quot;. The first versions were all based on Firefox. When I wrote the first version in 2006, Google had not yet started developing a web browser of its own, nor did the name &quot;Chrome&quot; exist as a Google product. Chrome versions followed in 2007, after internal beta test versions of Chrome started to be passed around inside Google.  Google&apos;s trust problem &gt;&gt; Washington Post Ezra Klein:   The problem, I&apos;m beginning to think, is simply mismatch. The core services of Google&apos;s business are often not the Google services I rely on most. And even when their core products and my needs do meet, the business connection is indirect. In this, Gmail is a good example. Google just needs me logged into their system so they can amass data on my browsing habits. That&apos;s the business. They don&apos;t make their money by giving me  or even letting me pay for  a superb e-mail program that offers unlimited storage. That&apos;s just how the business was sold. But perhaps that&apos;s the business I need. Together, the Gmail experience, the death of Google Reader, and the closure of Picnik all have me questioning whether I want to keep investing time and energy in &quot;free&quot; Google products or whether I need to start looking for paid services that are explicitly making money off the thing I am paying them to do.  Google Reader&apos;s closure is a milestone in Google&apos;s relationship with its users. Back to stock: get the Nexus look on any Android phone &gt;&gt; The Verge  Unlike iOS, every version of Android allows you to install replacements for a variety of UI elements. Some things, like menus, settings, and fonts, can&apos;t be changed easily, but you can get a very stock-like experience just by downloading a few apps available in Google Play right now. By replacing apps like the built-in launcher, lock screen, and keyboard, you can enjoy the cleaner, more beautiful &quot;Nexus look&quot; in just a few minutes.  No rooting or hacking required. Setback for Google&apos;s VP8: Nokia refuses to commit patents to royalty-free or FRAND licensing &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents Nokia is refusing to offer its patents that if says are used in video codec VP8 under FRAND or royalty-free licences to the IETF:   Nokia doesn&apos;t have an obligation to make a FRAND promise with respect to VP8. It wasn&apos;t involved in VP8 standard-setting. VP8 was and in practical terms (even if not in formal terms) still is a single-company project (when Google says &quot;open&quot;, it usually means &quot;control&quot;), and that&apos;s why no one can be forced to support it. By contrast, H.264 was an industry-wide initiative and everyone sitting at the standard-setting table agreed to FRAND licensing from the beginning. What Nokia is doing here is simply the normal course of business if a patent holder (Nokia) does not share the vision of another company (Google) with respect to a proposed standard and reserves all rights. What motivation could Nokia possibly have to donate something to a Google initiative? None. No motivation, no obligation, no license. Simple as that.  Please stop fighting about your smartphone &gt;&gt; Wired.com Mat Honan:   The phone wars, the platform wars, should be left to people who work for Apple and Samsung and Google and Microsoft and Nokia and BlackBerry. Do you work for Apple? Do you work for Samsung? No? Then shut up. Nobody cares what kind of smartphone you believe in. It&apos;s not a religion. It&apos;s not your local sports team even. Stop being a soldier. You are not a soldier. You are just wrong. Shut up. You there, with the blog, in the comments, in the pages of the newspaper or the magazine or on Twitter or Facebook. Whatever your opinion is, as soon as you employ it in partisan fashion, it&apos;s deeply and profoundly wrong. Just by sharing it, you are wrong. And nobody cares. Except for the people who do. And they are wrong too. Myself included. &quot;But, but, but,&quot; I hear you stammering like some sort of horrible person who has mistaken a code base for a system of moral beliefs, &quot;the screen is too big and not big enough.&quot; No. You&apos;re wrong.  A thousand times yes. If someone could write the music, we will make this our national anthem. The comments on the story are also worth reading. (Thanks @garymross on Twitter for the link.) Apple rolls out fix for password reset security hole, iForgot site back up | iMore.com Nick Arnott:   Apple&apos;s iForgot password reset page is now back online, and iMore has verified that the security hole, discovered earlier today in Apple&apos;s password reset page, has been closed. Previously, after providing a victim&apos;s Apple ID and date of birth, an attacker could send a URL to Apple that would change the password for that account, without needing to answer any security questions. In response, Apple blocked access to the password reset page, and a short while later took the entire site down in light of another loophole that still allowed the attack to be performed. This vulnerability came at an interesting time, just a day after Apple began to roll out its two-step verification system. Users who had already enrolled in the new system seem to have been immune from the password reset vulnerability. Unfortunately some users were held in a three-day waiting period for enabling two-step verification, while others live in countries where two-step verification is not currently available.  About six hours from publicity to fix (though there&apos;s no way of knowing how long it might have been exploited before that (although the page which detailed it was dated 22 March, the same day. Basically, it shows how risky GET is in URLs used for logins. BlackBerry: Morgan Stanley ups to overweight; less burn in devices Division &gt;&gt; Barrons.com  Shares of BlackBerry are up 73 cents, or 5%, at $15.76 after Morgan Stanley&apos;s Ehud Gelblum raised his rating on the shares to Overweight from Underweight, while raising his price target to $22 from $10, writing that the smartphone division, while having zero value in his appraisal of the company&apos;s worth, will nevertheless provide less of a burden on the profit of the services business, and that the company could turn a profit this year instead of the loss he had been expecting.  &quot;Overweight&quot; is a good thing - as in &quot;fill your boots&quot;. This is positive news for BlackBerry: Gelblum reckons that the handsets business will stop burning cash later this year, which will bring the whole business back into profit. Why the EU is unlikely to crack down on Apple over its carrier contracts &gt;&gt; GigaOm David Meyer:   A good (though not perfect) point of comparison here would be Intel, which found itself the subject of a $1.45 billion EU fine back in 2009 for abuse of its dominant position. Intel, which utterly dominated the x86 processor market as it does now, gave secret kickbacks to computer manufacturers and retailers for not stocking AMD-based products. It even paid manufacturers to delay or cancel the launch of non-Intel products. That was a clear-cut case of illegal practices, hurting consumers by limiting their choices. It&apos;s hard, if not impossible, to argue that consumers in the EU do not have easy access to non-Apple mobile devices.  Android has won; now what? &gt;&gt; The H Open: News and Features Glyn Moody:   Nor does Google have many friends left among the handset manufacturers. After the upbeat start five years ago, the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) has faded away  the last &quot;What&apos;s New&quot; item on its home page is dated 18 July 2011. It is probably no coincidence that shortly afterwards, on 15 August 2011, Google acquired Motorola Mobility, thus placing itself in direct competition with the other OHA members, who were presumably pretty cheesed off. Despite these bad things happening, it&apos;s worth emphasising how much Google has achieved with Android. Single-handedly it has established open systems and Linux as the default approach for mobile computing  both for smartphones and tablets. That may explain in part the sudden flowering of alternatives, all of which take for granted the fact that their systems will be Linux-based and open to varying degrees.

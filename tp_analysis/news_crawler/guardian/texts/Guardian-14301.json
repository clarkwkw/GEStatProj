    "text": "   The Thatcher Illusion, photoshopped by Al McCartney (@armccartney)    As televisions and newspapers report the death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, many are using images of her face to illustrate articles and reports. As a psychology undergraduate, I can&apos;t see these kind of images without thinking of a famous visual illusion. The Thatcher illusion, as first reported by Peter Thompson in 1980, is a phenomenon whereby expressions on faces are processed differently depending on their orientation. Thompson took a picture of Thatcher&apos;s face, and inverted the eyes and mouth within the image. Upside down, it is less obvious that something has changed, but turn it the correct way up, and a gruesome spectacle is presented. He suggested that the elements of faces might be processed serially when upside down, but in parallel when upright, explaining why the inverted eyes and mouth are less obvious when the whole face is the wrong way up. The effect has been studied extensively since, one research group even showing that rhesus monkeys experience the effect. There are a group of people who don&apos;t, though. Those with prosopagnosia, a congenital condition where suffers have a great difficulty identifying faces, don&apos;t see the illusion to the same degree.     Maybe it only works on politicians? Cameron's version of the Thatcher illusion. Photoshop skills by Al McCartney (@armccartney)    Why did Thompson pick Thatcher in the first place? There&apos;s an urban myth that he originally thought it would only work with Maggie&apos;s face. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s true, but it turned out not to be the case. It works for any face, as demonstrated with our current Prime Minister, above.",

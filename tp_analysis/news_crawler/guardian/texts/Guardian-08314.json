    "text": "Who can forget that beautiful scene in ET where Elliot&apos;s BMX floats past a large moon, defying gravity with grace and serenity, the boys legs peddling, his alien pal in the basket at the front. Well now you can sort of recreate that in Trials Evolution  but with less grace and more likelihood of horrendous crashes into rocky outcrops. Due out later this month, Origin of Pain is a DLC pack for the wonderful motorbike simulation, and its major addition is BMX. Yes, players will be able to attack a series of swooping, jump-riddled tracks on a cool white BMX, with mag wheels and a furiously peddling rider. We tried two of the new courses: Flow Like Water, which takes players through a mountainous area of the island, past waterfalls and beneath low hanging tree branches; and Cauldron Trail, a fiery romp through a lava filled volcano. The bike is agile and light, which means the handling is super sensitive, with the slightest pump of acceleration sending the front wheel flying into the air  deft, subtle balance is a key requirement, even more than the friskiest motorbikes. It&apos;s fun though, as the bikes are also easier to correct than their motorised cousins, so you can pull back from the craziest wheelies, and also stop on a six pence after hurtling down a sheer cliff face. Set on a new island location (which at 4km x 4km is twice the size of the environment in Evolution), there are 36 new tracks to try out, making excellent use of the varied, mountainous environment. As well as tropical rainforest areas, there&apos;s a circus on the island - and a landing strip. Red Lynx has also added a load of extra rider outfits and head gear, including deliciously ostentatious Roman centurion and astronaut helmets.       A bunch of new track editor features have been included, too. The key additions are the one hundred new obstacles including some super huge set-pieces such as jet planes and boats, giving avid Trials designers some intriguing new scenic possibilities; there&apos;s even a cannon that can shoot riders across the circuit. Oh and there&apos;s even a grappling hook, allowing bikers to swing their way through certain sections.      Several of the fresh circuits show off these features rather nicely, with one set amid a Lost-style crash site, complete with tricky jumps between sections of fuselage. There are also 30 new special effects ranging from fairy glitter dust to new smoke swirls  for the real completists. It&apos;s a generous selection box for Trials enthusiasts who have played the original circuits to death. And as there hasn&apos;t been a decent BMX title since the Dave Mirra years, a whole new audience is about to be lured right in. Indeed, with Trials Evolution: Gold Edition coming to PC soon (combining all the tracks from both Trails HD and Trials: Evolution - 129 in total), Red Lynx is determined to trap as many people as possible in its domain of speed, gravity and momentum.",

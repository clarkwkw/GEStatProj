    "text": "Activision has announced a new James Bond game. Due out this autumn on Xbox 360 and PS3, 007 Legends features a new story that ties together six Bond movies, including the forthcoming Skyfall. It&apos;s being developed by Eurocom, the UK studio previously responsible for the decent GoldenEye 007: Reloaded title. Naturally, the game will feature loads of signature Bond gadgets as well as familiar weapons, fast cars, and exotic locations. Alongside the main campaign the title will also feature a new set of single-player Mi6 Ops Missions, a sort of spec-ops mode first seen in GoldenEye: Reloaded. These tasks will also allow players to take part as Bond&apos;s allies as well as his enemies.  Local four-player split-screen and online multiplayer modes complete the package. These options will apparently include stealth and investigation elements as well as standard TDM and CTF derivatives.  Of course, Activision hasn&apos;t yet revealed the other five films to be condensed into this James Bond grab bag. We can expect more news to be stored on microfilm and smuggled into E3 this June.  For now though, if it was up to you ... which movies would you cram in?",

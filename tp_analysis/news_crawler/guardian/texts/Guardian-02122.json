    "text": "International Women&apos;s Day (IWD), is on 8 March and the theme for this year, Connecting girls, inspiring futures, couldn&apos;t be a better fit for the higher education sector. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), of the 17,465 academic staff in the UK who carry the title of professor just 19.8% are women, yet women make up 44.2% of the sector&apos;s academic staff. Women in non-academic roles fared better, making up 62.4% of the workforce, and holding just over half of all managerial roles. Musing on the position of women in higher education, Dr Anamaria Dutceac Segesten recently wrote that women in research were more at risk of job loss due to funding cuts, were delegated difficult conversations &quot;because they are so much better at it,&quot; and women in administration weren&apos;t trusted to handle students&apos; complaints. While IWD is about raising awareness of gender inequality, it is also about celebrating achievements and praising pioneers. The focus is often on the great and the good in public life, business and women in rural communities around the world, so we&apos;d like to cast the spotlight on women in higher education. Who has inspired you at a professional level, achieved recognition for a field of study or simply embodied what women in higher education can be or achieve?

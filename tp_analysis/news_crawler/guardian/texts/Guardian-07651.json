    "text": "That favourite of the angler the common sandpiper, a riverside companion which certainly does not interfere with sport, is much in evidence, for it is slowly moving south. On the tiny sand delta where the brook enters the mere or joins the river, on the pebble bank exposed when the water is low, on the mud which margins pool or stream, we may see the bird.One day it will be a solitary sandpiper, the next two or three together, and the third day perhaps a dozen. When next we visit the spot it will be deserted, but a few days later the gathering has begun once more. The birds linger at favourable feeding places, and then, one day, when a number have collected, the little party moves further south, though perhaps only for a few miles.It is the same with swifts, swallows, and other sociable travellers; the size of the party slowly increases as the birds move along the early stages of their long autumnal journey. But many warblers and other birds, urged or dragged onwards by the same resistless instinct, travel alone, feeding and often singing as they go towards the point from which they will start the dangerous foodless journey across the sea.

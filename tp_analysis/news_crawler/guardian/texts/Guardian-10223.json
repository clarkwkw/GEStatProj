    "text": "According to conventional wisdom, books and games are incompatible: the latter are often blamed by parents for a lack of interest among the former in their offspring. But Sony&apos;s London Studio has hit upon a very clever way of bridging that apparent chasm, in the form of Wonderbook. The Wonderbook is a blue, hardback book whose covers and pages, in its naked state, are covered with the sort of patterns (not unlike QR codes) that you find on Augmented Reality cards. It works with the PS3&apos;s PlayStation Camera and Move controller setup, is reusable, and the first piece of game-style software it works with couldn&apos;t be more appealing to parents: Miranda Goshawk&apos;s Book of Spells drops you slap-bang in the middle of Harry Potter&apos;s universe. Book of Spells certainly isn&apos;t a game in the conventional sense: instead, it takes you back to school. A prospect which may fill many of us with dread, except that the school in question is Hogwarts, and the crash-course on which you&apos;re embarking is spell-casting. There are 20 spells to learn, which start simply and build to the more potent and destructive efforts you would need to, say, challenge Lord Voldemort (who, sadly, doesn&apos;t make an appearance, although there&apos;s always the prospect of downloadable content). Initially, there are some setup chores to get out of the way, although the PlayStation Eye/Move combination&apos;s biggest strength is that it isn&apos;t difficult to get up and running.     Wonderbook: Book of Spells     Once you&apos;ve stuck the camera on top of your TV and positioned it so that it&apos;s pointing at you sitting cross-legged on the floor (or on a sofa) and can see the book in front of you, you&apos;re ready to roll. Grasp the Move, and you&apos;re given a modicum of control over what design of wand you want it to morph into. Specify your favoured house at Hogwarts, and give it your Pottermore login details (if appropriate) and the preamble is done. Now, the mirror-image of yourself staring back from the TV screen can be seen clutching a wand, and the blue book magically transforms into Miranda Goshawk&apos;s Book of Spells. Cutely, it&apos;s covered in virtual dust, which you must brush off with your hands (demonstrating how the system tracks your body as well as the book and the Move). A sparkly area appears on the front cover: aim your wand at it and pull the trigger, and words will leap up from the page, a convention which persists throughout. Parents can turn off the voiceover if they want to use Book of Spells as an aid to reading. Book of Spells is reassuringly rigid in its structure: it consists five chapters, each split in two, with the chance to learn between one and three spells in each half-chapter. Once you&apos;ve finished the first chapter, you can tackle the subsequent ones in any order. The spells consist an incantation (which is accurate in terms of the Potterverse, but not necessary when you&apos;re spellcasting) and a gesture to make with the wand. Generally, once you&apos;ve got a spell going, you can cast it in the right direction with a flick of the wrist; some involve hovering over the right area, then pressing the Move&apos;s trigger. There are other elements to Book of Spells, naturally. Sometimes you come across pop-up book-style dioramas which tell the stories of the witches and wizards who invented the spells, and a previous owner of the book has added scribbling which lead to bonus curses and spells. You&apos;re tested on each spell individually and, at the end of each chapter, you have to put them all together in imaginative ways, in order to solve specific problems. Depending on how well you perform, you&apos;ll be awarded between five and 15 House Points. As you work through the spells, you&apos;re transported to different parts of Hogwarts. You might, for example, find yourself in the Herbology classroom, having to harden bits of ground to stop encroaching elves from stealing Golden Galleons, or in the library, flicking Stun spells at attacking wizards. The feeling of actually being in Hogwarts, living a life much like that of Harry Potter, is deeply appealing, and will surely make young Harry Potter fans very happy indeed. The game is pitched fairly young: 13-year-olds and over, who are likely to have played more conventional games, will probably find it somewhat basic once the initially euphoria of entering the Potterverse has worn off. Although it&apos;s clear that JK Rowling has had plenty of involvement: there&apos;s a wealth of new material regarding the mythology around each spell, and it&apos;s all as sharply and amusingly written as you would expect. Those approaching Wonderbook: Book of Spells expecting fast-twitch gameplay will be disappointed (although the later spells require a certain amount of reflex action and precision). However, to expect that would be to miss the point entirely: it&apos;s essentially a digital babysitter. Any parent with Harry Potter-obsessed kids under the age of 12 and a PlayStation 3 will find it an absolute boon: you can park a bunch of kids in front of it and leave them to their own devices, safe in the knowledge that they should remain enthralled for at least an hour, and it won&apos;t be rotting their brains. Even though only one person can play it at a time, its immersive nature means a group of kids can feel as though they have entered Hogwarts, and you could envisage them taking turns with the Move. Book of Spells is very much Wonderbook 1.0, and future Wonderbook content, such as Diggs Nightcrawler, will introduce other forms of interaction (Sony is also collaborating with the BBC on Walking With Dinosaurs on Wonderbook, and has signed a deal with Disney for unspecified content). If you already own a PlayStation Eye/Move combo, it&apos;s pretty good value, and you can also buy a bundle with those items (which add an extra 35). Respect is due to Sony for figuring out how to turn Augmented Reality from an interesting tech-demo into something that makes commercial sense, and feels truly original.",

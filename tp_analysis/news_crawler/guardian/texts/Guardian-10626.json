    "text": " What if we could develop the technology to predict where and when the next viral pandemic will pop up? How might we do this? In the book, The Viral Storm: The Dawn of a New Pandemic Age, American virologist Nathan Wolfe takes us from steamy African jungles into modern climate-controlled laboratories in pursuit of exotic viruses [Penguin Press, 2011; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK/kindle UK; Amazon US/kindle US]. His goal: to identify which viruses show the potential to become the next deadly pandemic -- and to stop them before they reach a global stage.   In this book, Wolfe describes how viruses exploit human behaviours to generate pandemics. One such quality is our love of travel. Wolfe writes:  Over the past few hundred years, humans have constructed a radically interconnected world -- a world ... where humans can literally have their boots in the mud of Australia one day and in the rivers of the Amazon the next. This radically mobile world gives infectious agents ... a truly global stage on which to act. We no longer live on a planet where pockets of life persist for centuries without contact with others. We now live on a microbially unified planet. For better or worse, it&apos;s one world (italics the author&apos;s). [p. 118]  But globe trotting is not enough. Viruses must &quot;make the jump&quot; from their original hosts, which they are specially adapted to infect, into the human population. They do this in two ways. Since viruses multiply quickly and have high mutation rates, they rapidly generate the genetic raw material necessary to create distinct strains capable of infecting new host populations.  Another viral strategy is gene swapping. Since animals are sometimes infected by a number of different viruses at the same time, they can act as a living laboratory where different types of viruses trade genetic information, giving rise to mosaic viruses with novel qualities. This novelty underlies the sudden appearance of new human pathogens, such as HIV, which is the mosaic offspring of two viruses that infected a chimpanzee that was subsequently eaten by human bushmeat hunters. But bushmeat consumption is not the only source of new viral pathogens nor, perhaps, is it the primary one. Modern factory farming provides an important focal point for emerging viruses to adapt to humans. Wolfe writes: &quot;There are now more than one billion cattle, one billion pigs, and over twenty billion chickens living on our planet&quot; -- more domestic animals are alive today than in the past ten thousand years of domestication through 1960 combined. Yet, these food animals are crammed together into fewer farms than ever before, providing microbes with unparalleled opportunities to infect to them, each individual animal acting as a potential gateway for viruses to invade the human population. Already, this chain of events has been documented for influenza and Nipah viruses, which relied on pigs as their living workbench.  Industrial farming also increases the number of animals (and their viruses) that any one human is exposed to, abolishing the direct relationship between one animal and a few people. Modern factory farming creates a web of connections between thousands of animals and thousands of consumers, such that &quot;an average meat eater today will consume bits of millions of animals during their lifetimes.&quot;  Of course, most of the world&apos;s people now live in large cities that -- from a virus&apos;s point of view -- are identical to a factory farm. Major urban centres provide viruses with a ready source of fresh hosts to infect, allowing viruses to improve their ability to move quickly through the population and to become more virulent along the way.  But where might these exotic viruses originate? Wolfe argues that central Africa, with its combination of &quot;urbanization, deforestation, road building and consumption of wild game&quot;, presents a unique set of conditions that favour the emergence and spread of new viral infections to heavily populated regions of the world. Already, we&apos;ve found these same areas provide avenues for cosmopolitan viruses, such as pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses, to invade even the most remote villages.  Although he states that we should be doing a better job dealing with pandemics, Wolfe is an optimist. In the last of this memoir&apos;s three parts, he argues that emerging viral pandemics can be prevented. To that end, he co-founded a company, Global Viral Forecasting Initiative, that is establishing sentinel outposts in remote jungle locations where people still consume bushmeat, adapting the latest technologies to identify new diseases, and using rapid communication networks to track disease outbreaks.  I wanted very much to like this book unreservedly, but that was not the case. Repetitiveness and the irritating abuse of superlatives -- &quot;world renowned&quot;, &quot;excellent&quot; and (my personal favourite) &quot;perhaps the world&apos;s greatest expert&quot; -- to describe Wolfe&apos;s colleagues made the writing tedious at times. Although the diagrammes are good, the photographs, all of which are black and white, are not: they are very small and grainy, making it difficult to discern any details without resorting to a magnifying glass. Several photographs added nothing of value to the story and at least one overtly detracted -- a blonde female scientist, surrounded by a small crowd of male admirers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, applying make-up whilst peering into a motorbike mirror; a behaviour she apparently pulls off &quot;with flare&quot;. (I think the word the author wanted to use was &quot;flair&quot;, which we all know refers to &quot;talent&quot; instead of erupting into flames.) This is the only photograph depicting a female scientist in the entire book. In contrast, there are nine times as many pictures of male scientists, nearly all of whom are pictured doing lab or field work -- conspicuously, none of the men are applying make-up.  Despite its flaws, this book presents important information and ideas that the public should be aware of. Microbiology students and professors will probably enjoy this narrative, and this book could make an eye-opening read whilst on a transoceanic flight.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

Lokey Visiting Professor in Human Biology at Stanford University. He was also awarded a Fulbright fellowship and the NIH Director&apos;s Pioneer Award. Wolfe is the founder and CEO of Metabiota, a for-profit company specializing in microbiological research, products and services, and founder and Executive Chairman of Global Viral, a non-profit promoting understanding, exploration and stewardship of the microbial world. Wolfe has received financial support totaling over $30m in grants and contracts from Google.org, the Skoll Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the US Department of Defense and he has co-authored more than 80 scientific papers. This is his first book.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

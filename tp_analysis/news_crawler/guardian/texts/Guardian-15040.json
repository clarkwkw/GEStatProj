A Dead Space-alike on the fall of Anakin Skywalker?  Will Wright: Games &quot;falling way short&quot; as a medium | GamesIndustry   The veteran designer believes the industry is far from realizing games&apos; potential; he also says EA&apos;s Sim City server problems were &quot;inexcusable&quot;  This is from Wright&apos;s recent lecture at the University of California&apos;s Santa Cruz campus, entitled &quot;Gaming as a lens on the world.&quot; He&apos;s giving another one this week at Game Horizon in Gateshead.

Fuck Videogames | Darius Kazemi A somewhat polemical talk given by coder Darius Kazemi on why games aren&apos;t always the best medium for self-expression.  A lot of the perceived rewards of expressing something as a game are extrinsic rewards from the culture that&apos;s sprung up around gaming, and rather than chase those rewards in all cases, it&apos;s better/more rewarding to pursue the intrinsic reward of successfully expressing something on a case-by-case basis, in whatever medium fits that idea best.

And from Gearbox:  &quot;Attempting to wring a class action lawsuit out of a demonstration is beyond meritless. We continue to support the game, and will defend the rights of entertainers to share their works-in-progress without fear of frivolous litigation.&quot;  This is, of course, complicated by Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford allegedly claiming that early  and seemingly visually superior  demos shown at Pax and E3 were &quot;gameplay footage&quot;.

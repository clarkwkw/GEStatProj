    "text": "Here the South Downs Way runs along the top of the steep, north-facing scarp of the downs. The hard, white chalk foundation reassures and grips underfoot, it feels safe. This ancient sheep-droving path is the cultural backbone of the new South Downs National Park. The clouds are thick, the drizzle constant and the light feeble. The inclemency does not appear to concern the thick-fleeced sheep, penned onto the scarp by an electric fence. This is the classic downland landscape; its flower-filled meadows, scrub, valley woods and traditional scenery speaks to people and it is held dear. It is also of crucial significance to a whole set of rare and disappearing species, including Duke of Burgundy fritillaries, Cheese snails and Musk orchids. Bluish smoke rises over the crest, mixing with swirling mists now building up around the ridge. The buzz of chainsaws snakes through the air. A large work party is undertaking &quot;scrub-bashing&quot;. Sheep alone are insufficient in keeping the grassland open and vibrant. Scrub is always trying to replace chalk grassland; its efforts boosted in recent decades by atmospheric nitrate pollution, which fertilises the soil, disadvantaging the special plants. A long stretch of scrub has been cleared from the side of a coombe. Hopefully over the next few years, with the judicious application of herbicides, heat of the sun and attention of sheep, this hillside will regenerate as beautiful chalk meadowland, buzzing with bees and grasshoppers. The national park designation is wonderfully reaffirming, and sheep and humans coordinating their regenerative powers is reassuring, but there is a long way to go  large areas of the downs are profoundly damaged by modern arable farming and last year cherished juniper plants growing at Harting were heartlessly stolen.",

    "text": "For anyone new to the indie game scene, Ace of Spades is best described as the answer to &quot;what if you could shoot everything in Minecraft?&quot; Take the charming, blocky aesthetic of the &quot;build anything&quot; sandbox game, strap on a bunch of online-only, team-based multiplayer elements and let rip. There are some nice ideas here, particularly the potential to blur the lines between construction and destruction as you demolish the world and, ideally, tactically rebuild. Blocks are used much like ammo, with different player classes enjoying greater or lesser stocks to work with, and the classes themselves offer a few surprises beyond the FPS norms of soldier, commando and so forth. The jetpack-enabled parachutist is tremendous fun. The problem is that it never quite works. Server problems and disconnections are chronic and not once would an attempt at playing the zombies mode successfully load. Expectations of running through a cubic playground, infecting survivors with a hunger for geometric flesh, were dashed by a series of grey screens and a weary click of the &quot;return-to-menu&quot; button. Ace of Spades&apos; promise of terrain-altering group combat is tantalising  it just seems to be a promise it can&apos;t keep yet.",

    "text": "The authors of the letter (26 September) claiming that market-driven education is destroying university values are right, but not for the reasons that they give. The real culprit is not (yet) the current government&apos;s policies, but instead the vast amount of new money pumped into higher education over the past 20years in order to expand dramatically the proportion of young people with degrees of some sort. A high proportion of these additional recruits have not been interested in studying the traditional, mind-expanding subjects of philosophy, pure science, mathematics, the classics or European literature. So the new universities have concocted a large array of supposedly vocational courses for them without any genuine care as to whether the jobs market wants or needs all of these newly trained people, in these subjects, in such numbers. Mostly they do not. The &quot;market-driver&quot; for the education currently being provided by so many universities is not the external jobs marketplace for new graduates but instead the internal jobs marketplace, maintaining employment for academics and ancillary staff. That is the real scandal, which has led to a massive misallocation of the UK&apos;s educational resources such that, for example, still only a tiny proportion of our school leavers are capable of speaking a second language, in sharp contrast to the rest of Europe.Michael MillerHove, East Sussex  I have just seen an advert from a Greenwich college saying &quot;Complete your degree in just two years&quot;. This is just the start of the rot.Lorraine HaldaneHove, East Sussex",

    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Like many of the best iPhone/iPad games, Rock Runners&apos; interactions are minimal, requiring a simple tap to make your runner jump. From this one point of contact the game invents dozens of ways to challenge you, from grappling specially marked points, some of which move, to complex sequences of timed hops and high jumps . It&apos;s a process that demands total concentration, putting you either straight into the zone or right into a disaster of mistimed leaps and repeated sections that inevitably sees you missing the possible three stars available for each level. There&apos;s an upgrade shop where you can spend the jewels you collect in each run-through, imparting rechargeable short term powers like the force field or gem magnet, helping you tackle the later levels&apos; structures more easily. It&apos;s hugely addictive, well designed, fast-paced and only occasionally implacable in its challenge.",

    "text": "On this week&apos;s Tech Weekly, Aleks Krotoski is joined by Observer columnist and professor of public engagement with technology at Cambridge University John Naughton and Guardian technology editor Charles Arthur. The trio talk about the fallout of three of the biggest stories to rock the technology ocean this week. Making waves are the reshuffle at RIM - what happened in the last year that&apos;s seen this market leader take a dramatic tumble and cost the chief executives their jobs? What&apos;s the next for SOPA, now that the US Congress has shelved the current wording of the copyright bills, and what, asks John, does this say about our new concepts of ownership in a digital world? And is it the end of an era, now that film giant Kodak has filed for bankruptcy protection? John takes the long view, reminding us that it wasn&apos;t so long ago we thought Xerox was infallible. Charles suggests ways to future-proof your big idea so it sticks around into the next century. Charles also reports back from the Finnish version of Tech City, and test-drives some of the services and gadgets the startups there are hoping will be big hitters. From server technology to in-ear LED lights that tackle seasonal affective disorder  is there a method to the madness of the Finnish technology space? Finally, we hear more on John&apos;s latest book, From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need To Know About The Internet.  All this, plus chatter, gossip and laughs on Tech Weekly from the Guardian.",

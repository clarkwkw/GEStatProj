    "text": "   Overall winner: The Stargazer by Tommy Vikars, Finland 'There are two brothers in my home village who look after the game in the area and feed them regularly at several locations in winter. l was welcome to photograph white-tailed deer at one of their feeding places at night. l buried my sound-isolated camera box in the snow nearby. ln my warm hide about 50 metres away, l was ready with the camera's remote release. l used my other camera and a 300mm lens to check the scene. lt was  extremely difficult to see what was going on at the feeding place even though I had exhausted ISO and exposure values to their absolute maximum to give me at least a slight idea when to trigger the camera. I took many photographs, but often the deer would move too fast or in the wrong direction given the long exposure time'  Photograph: Tommy Vikars/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Birds winner: Mysterious and secretive by Markus Zadra, ltaly 'For three months, dedication, passion and even love accompanied me when I set out at dawn to observe this extremely rare and beautiful bird in the South Tyrolean lowlands. During this time, I had quite a few moving encounters with this young female kingfisher. One morning the rays of the sun created very special light conditions: the water gleamed in striking colours, and the sharp beak pointed like a sword into this mysterious and secretive atmosphere' Photograph: Markus Zadra/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Birds runner-up: Life behind bars by Hermann Hirsch, Germany  'Early this year l discovered several wrens in a municipal forest in Dortmund who nosily staked out their territory. When school finished the following day, I immediately took my bike and went back to the spot. It was already dusk and the sun created a soft orange light in a forest already exploding with colour. The wrens were still strongly engaged in their business and seemed completely untroubled by my presence. Without any camouflaging and tripod l took a number of pictures of the little star tenors, including this one' Photograph: Hermann Hirsch/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Birds highly commended: Back front back by Jerome Guillaumot, France  On an almost completely frozen lake in Kiskunsgi national park (Hungary) a number of egrets were fighting for the best place to fish. After numerous tires the situation I was able to capture this somewhat bizarre arrangement of three egrets' Photograph:  Jerome Guillaumot/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Mammals category winner: Badger in Underwood at dusk by Florent Cardinaux, France  'For two years in spring and summer I have been photographing badgers near their burrow using black and white negative. This image was quite a challenge: I needed the badger in a specific position with his head raised where the sky and foliage in the background provided some structure. Difficult - but finally after two weeks of patience, the image was captured' Photograph: Florent Cardinaux/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Mammals runner-up: Ole Jrgen Liodden, Norway  'l have photographed more than 100 polar bears around the islands of Svalbard, northern Norway, but in July 2011 came across a truly unique opportunity. A polar bear came close to our expedition ship, and with the landscape, the ice, the shape of the bear and the footprints everything was just right. But this is also a sad image: due to climate change the Arctic drift ice is getting thinner and less dense in the area, reducing the polar bears' habitat dramatically' Photograph: Ole Jrgen Liodden/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Mammals highly commended: The gourmet by Leopold Kanzler, Austria 'It was the time of the deer rut, and i was hoping for the appearance of a royal stag. From my hide in a corn field I observed a hare, nibbling at the thin stalks of grass. i had the impression the hare had also noticed my presence and his eyes glued to me. When I then checked the image on the camera's  display, I was quite grateful for his suspicion' Photograph: Leopold Kanzler /2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Mammals category highly commended: Thomsons gazelle being focused by Bouguereau Gregoire, France  'During the breeding season young Thornsons gazelles are easy prey. They are also the first prey with which young cheetahs perfect their hunting skills. On that day in April 2011 in Tanzanias Serengeti national park, the adult cheetah had caught this fawn, and then let her four cubs finish the hunt. At first. they did not seem particularly interested in the fawn, but its attempt to escape suddenly aroused their natural predatory instincts. As luck would have it, I was right in the preys path of flight and was able to take this picture at the moment when the young cheetahs all focused in unison on the fleeing gazelle' Photograph: Grgoire Bouguereau/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Underwater world winner: The pursuit by Cristobal Serrano, Spain  'At a depth of 20 meters, lying face up on the sandy bed of the Sea of Cortez, Baja California, l was lying in wait to photograph a fishing cormorant. I was constantly forced to change my position since it was impossible to say  from which direction the bird would come. With my fisheye lens l also wanted to get as close as possible to the action. Finally, everything fell into place: in my immediate vicinity the cormorant plummeted bullet-like into a shoal of grunts, scattering them in all directions to isolate individual fish' Photograph: Cristobal Serrano/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Underwater world highly commended: Waiting for the light by Angel Fitor, Spain  'The Mediterranean jellyfish Cotylorhiza tuberculata feeds both on plankton and sugars generated as waste products by an algae with which they form a symbiotic relationship. Mar Menor lagoon in south-east Spain provides not much plankton, but its eutrophic water and the high levels of solar radiation make it a perfect habitat for these jellyfish which multiply by the thousands. At dawn they gather just beneath the water's surface to trigger the photosynthesis' Photograph: Angel Fitor/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Man and nature winner: Survivor by Ferenc Somodi, Hungary  'Frogs are among my favourite subjects. Although Hungary has in recent ears implemented various measures to protect these migrating amphibians, many still fall victim to road traffic' Photograph: Ferenc Somodi/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Man and nature runner-up: Life and death in Greenland by Audun Rikardsen, Norway  'This picture was taken on board a 40ft fishing and whaling boat on the west coast of Greenland hunting for minke whales. The Inuit culture is based on using Arctic marine resources including large whales. Many families and communities still depend on hunting for both food and income although whaling is now under strict international restrictions. Rather than their traditional kayaks, most Inuit whalers now use larger boats equipped with grenade-tipped harpoons or smaller outboard motor boats to hunt in groups' Photograph: Audun Rikardsen/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Natures studio winner: Happy feet by Knut-Sverre Horn, Norway  'Usually I take a more journalistic approach to bird photography, documenting their behaviour and habitat, but sometimes I also enjoy more abstract images. The technique that I employed here - focusing slightly behind the subject set against a shimmering bright background - is common among flower photographers but rarely seen in bird shots. i framed some guillemots and waited for other birds to arrive in the background, flapping their wings and feet. This image is not cropped. It was taken on the island Hornoya in Varanger, northern Norway, during a workshop in spring 2011' Photograph: Knut-Sverre Horn/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Natures studio runner-up: Yin-Yang by lstvn Kerekes, Hungary 'In February 2012 I was photographing ice structures on a dead arm of the river Danube near a village called Rajka in western Hungary. It had been very cold previously but not snowing so conditions were ideal. When I later looked at the images on the computer screen, I discovered that if I rotated the image by |800, it actually looked like the ancient symbol of yin and yang, two central concepts of the Taoist philosophy' Photograph: lstvn Kerekes/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Natures studio highly commended: Coral sand by David Maitland, United Kingdom The hard defensive calcarious structures (spicules) incorporated within the bodies of many soft-bodied marine invertebrates including Gorgonian corals, Sponges and Hoiothuria accumulate as coral sand on the sea floor and form a major constituent of many tropical white sandy beaches' Photograph: David Maitland/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Other animals category runner-up: First kiss by Klaus Tamm, Germany  'It was a sunny morning on the French island La Reunion not far from the small town of Etang-Sale-les-Hauts. I discovered a few unfamiliar flies on the patio railing of our holiday apartment. Some of them ate away at the gecko droppings while others showed an expressive mating behaviour that ended in something that looked like they were kissing. I was so captivated by these insects that l sat there observing and photographing them for several hours' Photograph: Klaus Tamm/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Other animals highly commended: Crane Fly by David Maitland, United Kingdom  'The head of a long-palped crane fly (Tipula Vernalis) commonly called daddy long legs in the UK. The spectacular metallic green compound eyes of this crane fly are unusual among crane flies which typically have unremarkable black-coloured eyes. The function of this green colour is unknown. There are about 88 species of Tipula in the UK' Photograph: David Maitland/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Other animals highly commended: Hephaestus by Bart Siebelink, the Netherlands  'In the harbour of the small coastal town of Ulcnje in Montenegro we were observing several crabs at night. The surf kept washing over them, but they clung firmly on to the rocks. The reflections of orange-coloured streetlights made the waves look like fire. I used a slow shutter speed to create a fierce volcanic scene, transforming the crab into a mysterious, mythological creature' Photograph: Bart Siebelink/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       Plants and fungi category highly commended: Plants in motion by Rosa Isabel Vazquez, Spain  'It was the last evening before going back home from a trip in Scotland and l decided to take some pictures as I went along Loch Lomond. It had been raining for the whole week and the weather was still fairly unpleasant, but at least it was not raining anymore. The wind ruffled the water's surface and also the trees and bushes along the shore. It was a very beautiful scene, and I opted for a rather long shutter speed of I3 seconds to capture the movement of the plants while giving the water a silk appearance' Photograph: Rosa Isabel Vazque/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer Landscapes category Highly Commended Rainbow over Two Medicine Lake by Frank Krahmer (GDT)  (Germany) One of the most magical moments I have ever experienced! After a rainy night and without reasonable chances of success, We Went to Two Medicine Lake in Glacier National Park for daybreak. Chances Were, in fact, zero; to the east Where the sun would rise, mountains obstructed the horizon. But then, as by a miracle, the pyramid of Sinopah Mountain  up in bright orange in just the same moment when a heavy shower of rain moved in fromthe West. There was still no Wind but rain over the mountain and perfect morning light and thus a perfect rainbow. Photograph: Frank Krahmer /2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer  ",

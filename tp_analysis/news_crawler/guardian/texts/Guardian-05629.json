    "text": "Earlier this month the universities secretary David Willetts devoted a significant part of his speech at HEFCE&apos;s annual conference to the issue of widening participation. He endorsed the practice, already adopted by many universities, of offering places to applicants lower grades with from poorly performing schools or low incomes homes. &quot;Grades are not the only indicator,&quot; he told his audience, suggesting that admission &quot;can be based on more than just A-Level results, by looking at all the information that indicates the potential of an individual to succeed. The aim is that those who can perform best at any given university are selected for it.&quot; A survey by SPA (supporting professionalism in admissions) late last year showed that almost a quarter of universities were planning to offer lower grades to 2012 applicants from poor schools or deprived backgrounds. According to Willetts, spending on widening participation by universities and bodies such as Office of Fair Access (OFFA) and Higher Education Funding Council England (HEFCE) is set to increase by 100m in 2012/13 against 2009/10 figures. Universities have been spending significant sums for many years on improving access to HE. There have been some imaginative and innovative schemes which must already have increased opportunities for many people. Although institutions assess the impact of their own work, there&apos;s been little attempt to evaluate this activity nationally and to draw some conclusions on the kinds of interventions that are most effective. I&apos;ve always thought this was a tremendous wasted opportunity but now Willetts is acting to address this. He told the conference that he is asking HEFCE and OFFA to &quot;develop a shared strategy for widening access to maximise the impact of the combined investment across the entire sector. In particular, we&apos;ve stressed the importance of all widening participation activity resting on a firm evidence base - derived both domestically and from overseas - in order to deliver improvements throughout the HE system.&quot; He went on: &quot;It&apos;s vital here that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, with the minimum of duplicated effort, the commissioning of new broadly valid research, where appropriate, and integrated monitoring of performance, wherever possible. Let&apos;s not forget that the whole point of this work and this investment is to identify and realise human potential&quot;. Given the last Labour government&apos;s claim to be implementing &quot;evidence based policy&quot; it&apos;s a mystery to me why OFFA has never been resourced to carry out this research and evaluation itself. I would sound a note of caution however on any attempt to impose a shared template for widening participation across the sector. The best initiatives are often successful because they are responding to local circumstances and universities must be free to tailor their access initiatives to meet the particular needs of their local communities. As is so often the case with these big set-piece speeches, one of the most interesting ideas from Willetts came in questions afterwards. The Telegraph reported that he floated the idea that more universities could follow the example of the medical school at King&apos;s College London, and offer bright pupils from non-selective state schools an extra foundation year to enable them to catch up with more privileged, often hot-housed pupils. &quot;We know, at the end of the day, that their chances of getting a good medical degree are as good as those who turn up with three As,&quot; he said. A foundation year would seem to be a neat solution to the constant refrain of the Russell group that the effects of poverty and poor schooling are the most significant obstacles to widening participation. Research highlighted by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Sutton Trust shows how the academic potential of tens of thousands of poor children is being wasted. Many children on free school meals are top performers when they are at eleven  but by the time they finish compulsory schooling two-thirds of those bright pupils have dropped out of the top group. As a result, each year sixty-thousand children who have been top performers at some point in their school career  and so should make it to higher education  fail to make it to university. A thought-provoking article by Jeevan Vasagar shows how this is playing out on the ground in admissions offices across the UK. He was allowed to listen in on the discussions of admissions tutors at Churchill College Cambridge. He describes the case of one bright young pupil, which illustrates the problem better than any statistical litany:  &quot;She has had &apos;unimaginable teaching difficulties&apos;, the tutors hear. She has taken her A-levels at a school that has had a spectacularly high turnover of teachers. Peering at his laptop when her name is announced, Nick Cutler, an admissions tutor at Churchill, says there are &apos;multiple flags&apos;. The flags are used to indicate factors such as poverty, or a school that performs very poorly at GCSE. There are six categories in all  including whether an applicant has spent time in care. There is evidence that a strong candidate from a bad school is likely to perform well when they come to Cambridge. But the academics are concerned that in this case, the school has been so turbulent that she simply lacks essential knowledge. Her examination and interview marks are low.&quot; &quot;The rapid pace of Cambridge would &quot;kill her&quot;, one of the academics says. Another agrees: &quot;I would really like to give her a place, but for her own sanity, she&apos;s much better going to one of the other redbrick, Russell Group universities, and just taking her time.&quot;  A foundation year is not the only way of addressing this issue  many universities are taking an even more direct role by sponsoring academies and technical colleges. Of course the suggestion that universities should take a hand and do the job that ought to have been done by schools and anti poverty initiatives, will infuriate many. They will argue that universities cannot be expected to solve all the problems of society. But finding and nurturing the talented people who can advance our knowledge must surely be one of the primary purposes of university. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

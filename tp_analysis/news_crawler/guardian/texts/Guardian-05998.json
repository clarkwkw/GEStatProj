    "text": "Description A 12-tentacled anemone with W-shaped markings down each of its limbs. Ecology Members of this genus don&apos;t attach themselves to rocks as most anemones do  they burrow. At its base this species has slender column, which it buries in the sand; the column has rounded end that acts as an anchor. Its tentacles seize passing prey, which they transfer to the central mouth. Distribution Found offshore down to about 50m, generally on the west coast of Britain.

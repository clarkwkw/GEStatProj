    "text": "Cycling is back on the agenda. A cross-party report by MPs and peers recommends investing 1bn-plus a year in making Britains roads more cycle-friendly, with such an investment paying for itself many times over with improvements in pollution levels, congestion and general health. The report [PDF] pulls no punches on the scale of change required, its introduction pointing out the implimentation of its recommendations will require a fundamental cultural shift in the way we think about the way we travel. Cycling needs to be not just a personal option, when we decide how to travel for work, school or leisure, but as a core issue when planning our streets, roads, buildings and communities. Encouragingly, the report highlights and acknowledges the current piecemeal and often counter-productive provision of cycle infrastructure across the country: they are short or come to an abrupt end at particularly hazardous locations, or weave across road way and pavement interrupted by street lights, trees or other barriers, or are too narrow. This tallied with experiences of our readers, with Leodis75 commenting: give cyclists decent cycle lanes on roads, not the ones we have now which are in Door zones, full of pot holes and poorly designed. Tophrd added: Extra funding is a great idea, but local councils can&apos;t be left to design their own cycling infrastructure. They&apos;ve demonstrated time and time again that they don&apos;t understand the needs of cyclists. Heffer was specific: Lewes - Ringmer an expensive 100 yard stretch of segregated cycleway was built behind a line of a hedge - fantastic!... its got to be joined up in some meaningful way. This is where you come in. Wed like you to send us examples of poor cycle infrastructure from across the UK. Whether its a cycle lane that ends abruptly with a lamppost, a lane that passes dangerously along parked cars, or - my own personal favourite - a lane that mysteriously disappears just as things are starting to get tricky, we want your images to highlight where Britain has been going wrong with providing safe, sensible and joined-up routes for cyclists. You can submit your photos by clicking the blue &apos;contribute to this article&apos; buttons. We will highlight the best we receive in a future blog post and gallery. Were also keen to map the infrastructure situation for cyclists across the country, so it would be helpful if you were to include a location along with your submission. If youre posting from a smartphone via our GuardianWitness app, make sure you have location switched on so we can make our map as accurate as possible.

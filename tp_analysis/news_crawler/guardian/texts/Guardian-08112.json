    "text": "Samsung has been showing off its new television sets at the IFA 2012 consumer electronics event in Berlin  and it seems super high-specs aren&apos;t enough to sell modern flatscreen HD displays anymore. You need games as well. Specifically one game in particular: Angry Birds. While showing off its new 75-inch LED ES9000 Smart TV, complete with internet access and specialist app store, the company revealed a new version of Angry Birds, which can be played with the television&apos;s gesture control technology. Rather like the Xbox Kinect technology, Samsung&apos;s catchily titled &apos;Smart TV with Gesture Control&apos; range all have a built-in camera that lets you control your television by wafting your arms around. For Angry Birds, you&apos;ll be able to catapult your furious avian missiles by... doing some sort of catapult gesture. It&apos;s interesting in the HD era, where pretty much every LCD set features variations on the same display technology, and most punters can&apos;t tell the difference anymore, manufacturers are having to become a bit more imaginative about how they differentiate their products. Turning televisions into gaming and web access devices seems to be the way ahead. Samsung&apos;s app store already boasts over 2000 applications. It&apos;s certainly not alone. The latest TVs from LG also have their own app store. Meanwhile, tech firm Ubitus, has been showing its GPU-accelerated cloud gaming solution, GameCloud, to television manufacturers at IFA  this will allow the next generation of TVs to stream hi-end console-type games  without the need for any sort of specialist gaming box. Interesting times.",

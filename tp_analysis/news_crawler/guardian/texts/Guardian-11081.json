That does not mean that mobile devices will displace PCs altogether. The rise of mobile phones, after all, did not mean that fixed-line phones stopped working, even if their number is now in decline. Although mobile devices and users will soon be more numerous, for the time being they will account for a smaller volume of traffic and fewer minutes of overall use than PC-based browsing. Yet the centre of gravity of the internet will have shifted.  IBM creates first cheap, commercially viable, electronic-photonic integrated chip &gt;&gt; ExtremeTech  After more than a decade of research, and a proof of concept in 2010, IBM Research has finally cracked silicon nanophotonics (or CMOS-integrated nanophotonics, CINP, to give its full name). IBM has proven that it can produce these chips on a commercial process, and they could be on the market within a couple of years. This is primarily big news for supercomputing and the cloud, where the limited bandwidth between servers is a major bottleneck.  Brands and ODMs see less than 10% on-month drop in November notebook shipments &gt;&gt; Digitimes  The global top-5 notebook brands together suffered a 4% on-month drop in November, but Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Acer, which had deep on-month drops in October, saw rather stable performance for the month. HP enjoyed a slight shipment growth in November, while Acer had flat performance; however, Asustek Computer, which achieved strong shipments in October, saw the worst drop among the top-5 vendors in November due to unsatisfactory demand for Windows 8 notebooks, according to Digitimes Research senior analyst Joanne Chien.   Perhaps more significant is that Dell fell from 4th to 5th place, behind Asus, in November. Launch Chrome as a Windows 8 app &gt;&gt; Google Chrome Help Ta-da - it&apos;s there. Google - Facebook amicus brief criticising patents on abstract ideas &gt;&gt; Scribd  Bare-bones patents like the one asserted in this case are invalid under 35 USC s101 because they claim abstract ideas when used on a computer or over the Internet, without more. Because such patents merely divide an abstract idea into its component parts, the real work comes later, when others undertake the innovative task of developing concrete applications.  Ubuntu Spyware: What to Do? &gt;&gt; Free Software Foundation Richard Stallman:   Proprietary software is associated with malicious treatment of the user: surveillance code, digital handcuffs (DRM or Digital Restrictions Management) to restrict users, and back doors that can do nasty things under remote control. Programs that do any of these things are malware and should be treated as such. Widely used examples include Windows, the iThings, and the Amazon &quot;Kindle&quot; product for virtual book burning, which do all three; Macintosh and the Playstation III which impose DRM; most portable phones, which do spying and have back doors; Adobe Flash Player, which does spying and enforces DRM; and plenty of apps for iThings and Android, which are guilty of one or more of these nasty practices... Ubuntu uses the information about searches to show the user ads to buy various things from Amazon. Amazon commits many wrongs (see http://stallman.org/amazon.html); by promoting Amazon, Canonical contributes to them. However, the ads are not the core of the problem. The main issue is the spying. Canonical says it does not tell Amazon who searched for what. However, it is just as bad for Canonical to collect your personal information as it would have been for Amazon to collect it.  Android won. Windows lost. Now what? The battle of the century is decided. Microsoft relegated to ever smaller PC corner as Google conquers the world &gt;&gt; Communities Dominate Brands Tomi Ahonen:  the winner is Google with Android. The future of computing, the future of the internet, the future of music, of gaming, of television, of newsmedia, of banking and credit cards and even cash itself. The platform that will be in our cars, soon in our clothes and eventually embedded within humans - all that will be owned and controlled by Google, as an evolution of what we now know &apos;only&apos; as the smartphone platform, Android. Wow. So this is my first blog after Google achieved its victory, to examine these thoughts, what does that mean for humanity, for business and tech, for media and marketing and advertising.   Those who know Ahonen&apos;s writings will know that (a) he examines this at length (b) it turns out to be Nokia&apos;s fault. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.) Review: 21.5-inch 2012 iMac takes two steps forward, one step back &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  Here&apos;s our biggest problem with the new iMac: making a laptop thinner and lighter is immediately noticeable. You touch and move a laptop constantly...  In a desktop computer, though, the pursuit of thinness at the cost of features makes less sense. The vast majority of the time, it&apos;s going to be sitting on your desk, and users will be interacting with a separate keyboard and mouse, pausing only occasionally to plug something in or adjust the screen&apos;s angle. Giving up desirable features like user-upgradeable RAM just to make a thinner desktop seems like the wrong move, even if it&apos;s one that only IT people and power users will notice or care about.   It&apos;s also a maintenance, support and repairability issue. All disk drives die. RAM upgrades are desirable. And you don&apos;t see the thinness when you&apos;re using the machine. Making a desktop less repairable is a bad move. Nothing else. (Thanks @rubbernuke for the link.) Over three times more smartphones shipped than PCs in 2012 Q3 in the Peoples&apos; Republic of China &gt;&gt; IDC  According to the latest IDC Asia/Pacific Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, the PRC smartphone shipments reached a record high and broke past the 60m unit mark in 2012 Q3, over three times more than PRC PC shipments in the same quarter. Smartphones shipped to the PRC grew 38% QoQ, far outpacing the 9% QoQ growth of the total mobile phone market.  &quot;Vendors ramped up shipments and aggressively launched new models to meet consumer demand during the Q3 summer school vacation and the National Day holiday period,&quot; said James Yan, Senior Market Analyst for Computing Systems Research at IDC China. &quot;A new wave of sub-US$150 smartphones with upgraded specifications, such as a 4-inch+ screen size and dual-core application processors, were especially popular.&quot;   That&apos;s mainland China (as opposed to Taiwan.) No more Instagram photos inside of Twitter &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  Instagram completely turned off support for Twitter Cards technology on Sunday, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to AllThingsD.  While users can still post links to their Instagram photos on Twitter, they&apos;ll no longer be able to view Instagram photos from within the Twitter stream across both the Twitter Web site and mobile apps.   That&apos;s really rubbish. Police concerned with Apple iOS 6 mapping system &gt;&gt; Victoria Police Online News Centre  Mildura Police are urging motorists to be careful when relying on the mapping system on the Apple i-phones operating on the iOS 6 system after a number of motorists were directed off the beaten track in recent weeks.  Local Police have been called to assist distressed motorists who have become stranded within the Murray-Sunset National Park after following directions on their Apple i-phone.  Tests on the mapping system by police confirm the mapping systems lists Mildura in the middle of the Murray Sunset National Park, approximately 70km away from the actual location of Mildura.  Police are extremely concerned as there is no water supply within the Park and temperatures can reach as high as 46 degrees, making this a potentially life threatening issue.   Serious.

    "text": "The next head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) will hail from the global south, it is expected to be announced on Friday. In its 18-year history, the global trade body has had only one director general from an emerging economy, Supachai Panitchpakdi, of Thailand, who held the post from 2002 to 2005. Although the race to replace the incumbent, Pascal Lamy, is ongoing, the two candidates who remain in the running after the latest round of elimination are: Roberto Azevdo (pdf), from Brazil, and Herminio Blanco (pdf), from Mexico. The nationalities of the finalists represent &quot;an evolution of the changing face of the [WTO] membership&quot;, says Kimberly Elliott, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington. &quot;Moving from the old [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] to the WTO, there was a big increase in developing country membership,&quot; Elliott says. &quot;So I think partly it&apos;s just a recognition that the membership is broader and that all the members need to feel they have a stake in the organisation.&quot; While the director general spot is not reserved for any particular country or region, trade officials in Geneva &quot;seem to be trying to put in place some sort of a [geographical] rotation system&quot;, says Elliot. &quot;At the WTO, whatever we say about how we would like to see a merit-based process, it is very political.&quot; When the selection process got under way in December, trade observers speculated that it was the &quot;turn&quot; of either Latin America or Africa, two regions that had never been represented in the post. The two sub-Saharan African candidates, Alan Kyerematen, of Ghana, and Amina Mohamed, of Kenya, were eliminated in the first round this month. &quot;That tilted it more toward the Latins,&quot; says Elliott, adding that an African candidate is likely to be chosen as the head of another international trade body, the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad), later this year. The results of the latest elimination round were reported by Reuters on Thursday. An official announcement from the WTO is expected on Friday afternoon. The selection of Azevdo and Blanco means that Mari Pangestu, of Indonesia, Tim Groser, from New Zealand, and Taeho Bark, of South Korea, are no longer in the running. Nominees from Costa Rica and Jordan, as well as from Ghana and Kenya, were knocked out in the first round. With a final decision expected before the end of May, it is up to the two remaining candidates to prove themselves to the WTO membership. Azevdo, who currently serves as Brazil&apos;s ambassador to the WTO, is viewed as the more junior candidate. A charismatic figure, he is well liked at the Geneva headquarters, but he has no experience at higher levels of government. Blanco, meanwhile, earned his trade credentials as Mexico&apos;s lead negotiator on the North American Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990s; he later served as trade minister. But Blanco has spent the past decade in the private sector, leading some observers to wonder whether he might be out of touch. &quot;Both candidates are highly respected with impressive track records,&quot; says Simon Evenett, a professor of trade and economics at the University of St Gallen, in Switzerland. &quot;The race isn&apos;t just within Latin America and both candidates will need to build support in Africa and Asia. Here, Brazil&apos;s well-oiled diplomatic machine has an edge.&quot; Whoever is chosen will take up the post on 1 September, replacing Lamy, who has served as the WTO head since 2005. The new director general will face the challenge of reviving the organisation&apos;s struggling Doha Round trade talks, which have been progressing in fits and starts since 2001. &quot;There are real doubts as to how much economic reform many countries are prepared to bind in enforceable WTO accords. That&apos;s the reality the new WTO head faces,&quot; says Evenett. &quot;Blanco and Azevdo should be careful what they wish for.&quot;",

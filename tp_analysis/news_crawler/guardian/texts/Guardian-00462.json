    "text": "BSkyB has launched a new iPad app for its Sky Sports News channel, while also predicting that tablet devices will be increasingly important for its business in 2012. The app is free for existing Sky Sports subscribers, but costs 4.99 as a standalone subscription using Apple&apos;s iOS subscriptions system. The app includes live streaming of Sky Sports News, but also enables users to set up to four favoured football teams on its homepage. Video highlights of sporting events can be watched on-demand, and the app also includes streaming Sky Sports News Radio, news and photo galleries. In a blog post announcing the app, BSkyB&apos;s director of mobile David Gibbs also reveals some figures from research commissioned by the broadcaster and carried out by Mintel, which explores the demand for TV apps on tablets and smartphones. &quot;Despite the generally gloomy economic outlook, the data shows the British public&apos;s appetite for mobile tablets shows no signs of slowing down,&quot; writes Gibbs in the post, titled &apos;2012: The year of the tablet?&apos;. &quot;8% of respondents in our research received a tablet over Christmas, which is on top of the 9% of the British population who already own one (according to Ofcom research released last year). Additionally, 16% intend to purchase a mobile tablet in the year ahead.&quot; The survey also finds that &quot;one in three respondents&quot; say watching films, TV shows and other video is a key reason for buying a tablet, behind internet access (67%), listening to music (48%), social networking (48%) and keeping up to date with news (40%). Gibbs says BSkyB has noticed the growth in demand for TV-related apps from its customers. &quot;During 2011, as smartphones and tablets became ever more sophisticated, and the quality of the TV experience they can deliver became ever more impressive, we saw an increasing demand from our customers to both watch TV on the move as well as enjoy experiences on companion devices that enhanced their enjoyment of our content,&quot; he writes. BSkyB has more than a dozen apps available across iOS, Android and other smartphones. In May 2011, Gibbs told a Mobile Monday conference in London that the broadcaster&apos;s apps had been downloaded 10.2m times on iPhone alone by that point. That number will be considerably higher now, although Gibbs does not provide an update in his blog post. However, he points to BSkyB&apos;s strong showing in comScore&apos;s October 2011 chart of connected mobile apps in the UK as proof of the popularity of its apps.",

    "text": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Stop the &apos;Do Not Track&apos; Madness &gt;&gt; Wired.com Lauren Weinstein:   Part of the problem is that the entire concept of simplistic internet &quot;Do Not Track&quot; systems is based on a number of false premises. Maybe the biggest misleading assertion is that internet advertising is essentially equivalent to the invasive telephone solicitations the &quot;Do Not Call&quot; registry was created to quash. But most internet ads -- occasional egregious exceptions notwithstanding -- aren&apos;t anything like some phone-calling stooge interrupting your dinner. And reducing the value of web ads to advertisers -- either through ad blocking systems or &quot;Do Not Track&quot; regimes that encourage random rather than personalized ads -- fundamentally undermines the primary funding mechanisms that help to satisfy our (let&apos;s admit it!) essentially selfish desires to keep most web services free.   On reading this that you suddenly understand that the thing about web ads is that hardly anyone acts on them at all. They may be some of the most-ignored content ever anywhere, and have been for years. Why should we opt out of Google&apos;s new privacy policy? &gt;&gt; Wired UK Max Tatton-Brown:   We&apos;re entering this strange phase of privacy where people truly can&apos;t fathom what is being done with their &quot;personal data&quot;. When they hear changes are coming, they for some reason equate that it means Google will be rifling through their old love letters and home videos and selling them to the highest bidder. For all the articles out there that detail how to circumvent Google&apos;s new privacy policy, there&apos;s a real lack of anything that truly explains why. It&apos;s also another fascinating example of the sense of entitlement people feel to free online services (news, search, maps, encyclopaedias) -- and how that is at odds with their understanding of how these companies make money.  In the Valley, anything less than 92% share makes you irrelevant &gt;&gt; Ed Bott Guess how many people run Vista?   Oh, look! Worldwide, 8% of all desktop/portable computer users are still running the hated, reviled Windows Vista. That&apos;s more than all users of OS X and Linux combined. And, of course, if you add up the number of Windows XP users (dominated by enterprises) and Windows 7 (mostly consumers and small businesses), the percentage is more than 10 times the total of all OS X and Linux users combined. That&apos;s from a worldwide base of nearly 1.5 billion traditional computers--PCs and Macs. Pretty good for an irrelevant company.   Yeah, but unlike Apple, Microsoft&apos;s invitations are really easy to decode. How Twitter broke Twitter &gt;&gt; The Incidental Economist Now notes whether you &quot;reply&quot; to a tweet and filters who sees it accordingly:   Dan initiated his tweet by &quot;replying&quot; to one of mine (i.e., he clicked &quot;reply&quot;). Back in 2009 Twitter changed what &quot;reply&quot; means. But even after that change, prefacing with a &quot;.&quot; did permit all your followers to see the reply (or so I&apos;ve been told). This seems to be one of the most important early lessons most learn on Twitter. There are loads of blog posts out there that explain this usage, and many since 2009. Now even that has changed. Clicking &quot;reply&quot; now means that only joint followers see the tweet even if you prefix it with a &quot;.&quot; (or anything else for that matter). You can still tweet at (@) someone with a &quot;.@&quot; construction and have all your followers see it but not if you click reply. When did this change occur? I cannot find anything on the internet that documents it. Is this the first post to do so?   A later addition says: &quot;Dan has been tracking this story and tells me that it appears Twitter has been changing their code over the past few hours. So, folks out there testing &quot;.@&quot; replies may be getting different results than we show above for that reason.&quot; UK Government: Open Standards Consultation Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude:   Open standards are vital for progressing this work and I encourage you to share your views in this consultation.   Get stuck in - or you can&apos;t complain in the future. Nokia&apos;s bet on Microsoft may still yield payoff - WSJ.com (Subscription may be required):   Part of the problem, said Mr. Elop, is that not only does Nokia have to sell phones, it has to sell the whole ecosystem. And in that space it appears to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting by itself. For while Microsoft says there are some eight manufacturers signed up to the platform only Nokia has declared it as its principal platform. On the stand of China&apos;s ZTE Corp. at Mobile World Congress, an assistant wasn&apos;t too clear how many Windows Mobile phones the company has in its portfolio: less than five, she seemed to think, compared to more than 20 Android devices. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Europe, Peter Chou, CEO of HTC Corp., one of the first to market with a Windows Phone device, said sales had been disappointing. Mr. Chou was in town to talk about its new Android phone. So who is to blame? Emma Mohr-McClune, research director at Current Analysis, laid part of the blame with the carriers. &quot;Carriers all talk about the need to support a third ecosystem, to create better balance in what is effectively an OS (operating system) duopoly. But so far there&apos;s been little more than lip-service. Windows Phone support should be more of a strategic priority, and I&apos;d like to see more creativity in the partnership,&quot; she said.  Inside Eric Schmidt&apos;s brain: Holodecks, robo-cars and jail bandwidth &gt;&gt; The Register Fun precis of Schmidt&apos;s speech:   As ever with these presentations it&apos;s the question-and-answer sessions which are most interesting - and it&apos;s a great shame that the other CEOs didn&apos;t follow Schmidt&apos;s example of giving 30 minutes of his time to the audience. Your humble scribe asked how Google would handle Chinese manufacturers violating Motorola Mobility&apos;s IP now that Google more or less owns it; Motorola was never brave enough to take on China&apos;s finest in the Asian nation&apos;s courts. Schmidt said he was aware of the issue, said he was not scared of asserting rights in China, but added that the merger was still in progress and no decision had been made.   Pity. But the writeup shows Schmidt as someone very much on top of even the tiny detail. Et tu, Google? Android apps can also secretly copy photos &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  As Bits reported earlier this week, developers who make applications for Apple iOS devices have access to a person&apos;s entire photo library, as long as that person allows the app to use location data. It turns out that Google, maker of the Android mobile operating system, takes it one step further. Android apps do not need permission to access a user&apos;s photos, and as long as an app has the right to access the Internet, it can copy those photos to a remote server without any notice, according to developers and mobile security experts. It is not clear whether any apps that are available for Android devices are actually doing this.   The proof-of-concept was done by Lookout Software, which specialises in spotting malware on mobiles. Google, in response, said it would consider changing its approach; &quot;A Google spokesman said that the lack of restrictions on photo access was a design choice related to the way early Android phones stored data.&quot; Opinion: Should you care about Pinterest? &gt;&gt; Macworld  &quot;A lot of what gets pinned on Pinterest is aspirational--what could be, what I&apos;m going to have, where I&apos;m going to go,&quot; said Gartner senior research analyst Jenny Sussin. What sets Pinterest apart from other social networks is that it isn&apos;t about sharing what&apos;s happening to you right now, it&apos;s about sharing and collecting what you like and what you want and what inspires you.   Some of bloggers I talked with who use Pinterest say they depend on it as a personal tool rather than a social one. &quot;I am always saving images for inspiration, future post ideas, and projects, so I use Pinterest every day,&quot; said Joy Cho of Oh Joy. &quot;It&apos;s just fun looking at a beautiful page of images that make me happy and inspire my work.&quot; Visual bookmarking isn&apos;t a totally new idea--sites like Ffffound have offered similar features. Pinterest just does it better.   That&apos;s the key thing about a social network - have a USP. Nokia 808 PureView pixels versus the iPhone 4S  The numbers behind the Nokia 808 PureView do boggle the mind. Or at least they should. The populist tech media has leapt up on the &apos;41 Megapixel&apos; figure and generally either misunderstood why it needs to be so high or questioned whether it&apos;s real in the first place. Yet that stat is only incidental in the bigger story.   A good read. (Thanks @anig for the link.) You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

    "text": "Electronic Arts has struck a deal with Katy Perry, singer of hits including I Kissed A Girl, to appear in its mega-selling franchise The Sims. Electronic Arts said that the &quot;extensive and exclusive creative collaboration&quot; would see the development of &quot;multiple games&quot; within the burgeoning Sims franchise that would feature &quot;Katy Perry-themed in-game content and virtual goods&quot;. Perry, who recently split from her husband Russell Brand, will also appear in new global advertising and marketing campaigns for The Sims on TV, online and in stores that sell the titles. Steve Schnur, worldwide executive of music for EA, said that Perry has been a fan of the Sims for &quot;several years&quot; pointing out that she made a recording of her song Hot and Cold in a style called &quot;Simlish&quot; for the game The Sims 2. The song became the most popular music video of its kind. &quot;I always like to think of myself as a cartoon, and now I&apos;m a Sim,&quot; said Perry. Perry will also work with The Sims Studio to create accessories, clothing, hairstyles, furniture and props for The Sims games &quot;that truly celebrate the imagination that she brings to her performances, music videos and life&quot;. The collaboration will begin with the launch of a Katy Perry-themed collector&apos;s edition for The Sims 3 Showtime, which will launch in March. Sims 3 Showtime allows players to live out a &quot;rags to riches&quot; story with the Sim characters to become &quot;singers, acrobats and magicians, or even moonlight as a DJ&quot;. &quot;Today marks the start of the most integrated and exciting collaboration with any artist in the history of The Sims,&quot; said Schnur. &quot;No performer could better represent the humour and fun of The Sims brand.&quot;",

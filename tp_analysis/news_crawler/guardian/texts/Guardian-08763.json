    "text": "The Science Museum in London is a treasure house of wonderful technological artefacts such as Stephenson&apos;s Rocket and Apollo 10. But are its glory days numbered in the new era of quantum mechanics, genomics and particle physics? What exhibit could possibly do justice to these abstruse fields of science? This week, Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample interviews Ian Blatchford, director of the Science Museum in London, and asks him how the museum plans to bring the Large Hadron Collider and the ephemeral Higgs boson to life for the public in an upcoming exhibition.  Blatchford also addresses criticism that the museum is too ready to accept corporate sponsorship  its climate change gallery is sponsored by Shell and its energy gallery is sponsored by BP, for example. And finally, has Blatchford ever been tempted to climb into the Apollo 10 capsule when no one is around? Subscribe for free via iTunes to ensure every episode gets delivered.

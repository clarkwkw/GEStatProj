    "text": "Welcome to this week&apos;s roundup of new and notable iPhone and iPad apps  those released for the first time in the last week, as opposed to updates to older apps. As ever, the price in brackets refers to the initial download, so some apps may include in-app purchases. The 30 best Android apps roundup was posted earlier in the day. For now, read on for the latest iOS releases worth knowing about: 123D Creature (1.49) Even Steve Jobs would&apos;ve raised a sceptical eyebrow if you&apos;d told him a few years ago that in 2013, people would be modelling digital-clay monsters on their iPads then getting them 3D-printed out. That&apos;s exactly the idea behind Autodesk&apos;s 123D Creature app though: you sculpt and paint creatures then export them as images and 3D models, or order a 3D-printed version from within the app.iPad Kickstarter for iPhone (Free) I wrote about this at more length yesterday, but the precis is this: crowdfunding website Kickstarter now has an official iPhone app. You can use it to see what projects musicians, artists, game developers and other creators are trying to raise money for and back them from your phone. And if you&apos;re running a project, you can keep an eye on your stats, and post updates to your backers from the device too.iPhone One Direction Scrapbook (Free) Given One Direction&apos;s escalating global fame, this free iOS app should be a sizeable hit among fans. It&apos;s a digital scrapbook for fans to paste in photos of the British boy band, customise them with their own photos and messages, then share on social networks.iPhone / iPad Sound Uncovered (Free) San Francisco&apos;s Exploratorium museum has launched this innovative and playful iPad app, aimed at all ages, which offers &quot;auditory illusions, acoustic phenomena, and other things that go bump, beep, boom, and vroom&quot;. It&apos;s an exploration of sound, from growling saxophones to noisy gum-chewing.iPad Tempo Smart Calendar (Free) Alas, us Brits clearly aren&apos;t smart enough for Tempo yet this new calendar app appears to be US-only for now. Developed at SRI, the company behind Apple&apos;s Siri technology, it&apos;s a mobile calendar app that pulls in emails, contacts and locations to your plans, while providing directions, documents, LinkedIn profiles and even sending apologetic &quot;running late&quot; emails and texts.iPhone DrawQuest (Free) Draw Something isn&apos;t dead just yet, but developers and startups are already trying to push the collaborative-drawing genre of apps onwards. Canvas Networks&apos; new effort is really interesting: less a competitive game, and more a daily drawing challenge: it provides the scenario for you to draw and share with friends.iPad Versu (Free) More creativity on iPad, this time from Linden Lab the company behind virtual world Second Life. No flying 3D penises here though: it&apos;s an &quot;interactive reading experience where the readers become the characters&quot;. Two stories are included initially, with you influencing the plot by taking actions at specific points. Choose Your Own Adventure did this a long time ago, of course, but Versu looks an intriguing update on the idea.iPad America&apos;s Presidents (2.99) More heavyweight literary action comes with this app from the Smithsonian Institution, based on its National Portrait Gallery&apos;s collection of US presidential portraits. The app guides you from George Washington to Barack Obama, with high-resolution versions of the paintings, plenty of information on the presidents, video interviews sharing more light on the artists, and even audio of Franklin D. Roosevelt&apos;s radio broadcasts. iPad JOOL (0.69) Sometimes just one feature is enough to make an iOS game stand out from the crowd. In this case, it&apos;s the fact that you can switch between the game&apos;s two heroes by spinning your device 180 degrees. It&apos;s more than a gimmick though: this is an engrossing action-platformer game with a look all its own. Oh, and &quot;really nasty death animations&quot;, if that&apos;s your bag.iPhone / iPad Essential Anatomy (20.99) Would you pay 21 quid for an anatomy app? You might if you were a medical student, because this app from 3D4Medical looks very polished indeed. It offers 3D models of six systems the skeleton, connective tissue, muscle, veins, arteries and nerves  as well as the brain and heart, with more to come.iPad Wunderlist 2 (Free) Excellent to-do list app Wunderlist 2 has been out for smartphones for a while, but now it has a native tablet version too. It&apos;s good for building all manner of lists, with reminders, notifications and social features thrown in for good measure.iPad NASCAR RaceView Mobile &apos;13 (Free) This might just be one of the whizziest second-screen TV apps yet: a full 3D visualisation of the US NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races: &quot;You can pan, zoom and spin to focus on a specific driver, or pull back to view the entire field&quot;, all while listening to live race-broadcast radio or audio from the drivers and teams.iPhone / iPad Flick Champions Winter Sports (0.69) There&apos;s a long tradition of multi-event Winter sports gaming I happily wasted weeks of my teenage life playing Epyx&apos; Winter Games back in the day. Chillingo is bringing the idea into 2013 with this collection of six sports: slalom, skating, ski jumping, ice hockey, curling and snowball fighting.iPhone / iPad Easy Studio Animate With Shapes (2.49) It&apos;s a really good week for creative children&apos;s apps, with Easy Studio being a marvellous example from French developer Les Trois Elles. It&apos;s an intuitive animation studio for kids to make scenes from shapes, then animate them. Two difficulty levels ensure younger children can use it too, with animations saveable for later amusement.iPad Stream That Song (Free) Can any app hope to rival Shazam when it comes to identifying music that&apos;s playing? Stream That Song is a neat new app made by a developer from Orange France&apos;s research labs which identifies a song playing in the real world, then provides links to play it in Spotify or Deezer&apos;s mobile apps.iPhone The Flying Alphabetinis (Free) Calling this game a Words With Friends for kids is slightly inaccurate it&apos;s more like Boggle but the idea of turn-based gameplay over the network is the main thing. It&apos;s designed to be played between children and their parents, although the use of in-app purchases to buy power-ups could create some interesting family competition.iPhone / iPad Die Hard (0.69) Bruce Willis is back, Back, BACK! in a new Die Hard movie this year, but this official mobile game concentrates on his character&apos;s son Jack McClane. It&apos;s an interesting splicing of the endless runner genre with third-person shooters: Temple Run meets Uncharted. Well, sort of.iPhone / iPad Twickets (iPhone) This is a great idea from developer Future Platforms: a &quot;free fan to fan ticket exchange&quot; that helps people buy and sell spare tickets to gigs, sports matches and other events in the UK. Tickets can&apos;t be sold for more than their face value so it&apos;s not a tout&apos;s paradise with an elegant design and social features tying into the existing Twickets Facebook and Twitter communities.Free Pokmon TV (Free) Yes, an official Pokmon app  the second in a few months, in fact, following the release of the Pokdex on iOS in 2012. This time round, the focus is on the Pokmon cartoon series, which is 700-odd episodes in now. The free app streams selected episodes, while also offering new film trailers and other exclusive features for Pokfans.iPhone / iPad Talking Friends Cartoons (Free) 700m downloads later, Outfit7&apos;s Talking Friends apps, including Talking Tom Cat and Talking Ginger, are one of the biggest digital brands of the App Store era. This app gathers the 10 animated shorts produced for Disney, and previously distributed on YouTube. It&apos;s had some teething problems at launch an ad promoting a 4-a-week mobile content subscription service has been swiftly removed  but there&apos;s no denying the popularity of Tom and friends.iPhone / iPad Gifted2you (Free) This is a really nice idea: an app that reminds you of special occasions, and enables you to browse a catalogue of products from &quot;artisans and smaller producers&quot; to friends and family. It can connect to your Facebook (but doesn&apos;t have to), and sends physical gifts within the UK.iPhone / iPad The Poppin Princess (2.99) This French children&apos;s app has recently been translated into English, which deserves to bring its charms to a wider audience. It revolves around a contest between a bunch of princesses to become the wife of a prince called Archibald, with lovely illustrations and plenty of interactivity for kids.iPhone / iPad Matthew Kenney&apos;s Everyday Raw Express (1.99) Not a euphemism. This iPhone cookery app is about food that isn&apos;t cooked: &quot;delicious, healthy and quick raw food recipes&quot; from chef and author Kenney. The app offers more than 50 recipes to try, with videos, photos and nutritional data also included.iPhone Rotolla (1.49) This game has been described as a cross between Tetris and Super Hexagon, which pretty much nails its charms. It sees you organising blocks as they rotate inside a hexagon, with the difficulty curve quickly ramping up to provide a proper challenge.iPhone / iPad Hunches in Bunches - Dr. Seuss (2.49) The latest Dr Seuss book-app from Oceanhouse Media stars creatures including a Sour Hunch, a Very Odd Hunch, the Homework Hunch, a Four-Way Hunch, the Nowhere Hunch  all trying to give the young hero advice, of varying quality. Impish rhymes and good features for children learning to read make it a winner.iPhone / iPad Dino Land (Free) On the one hand, Dino Land is a fun-looking free-to-play game for children, teaching them about dinosaurs as they collect a set of prehistoric monsters and learn facts about them. On the other, its in-app purchases go as high as 69.99 for virtual bones, which seems a bit much for a children&apos;s game. Parents will want to make sure their IAP settings are locked down before letting their kids play.iPhone / iPad Red in Bed (1.49) This excellent children&apos;s app teaches kids about the colours of the rainbow. It tells the tale of the colours painting the world, apart from Red (who&apos;s ill in bed). Each colour gets its own musical note, too  ideal for tap-happy children.iPad Aces of the Luftwaffe (0.69) Fancy some old-school shoot &apos;em up action? HandyGames&apos; Aces of the Luftwaffe pitches you into the Battle of Britain, trying to fend off the massed ranks of Luftwaffe fighter planes, including the odd boss battle.iPhone / iPad KakaoAlbum (Free) Hundreds of new photo-sharing apps are released every week for iPhone, so why single this one out? Well, it&apos;s a spin-off from KakaoTalk, a hugely popular messaging app in South Korea and south east Asia with well over 50m users. So while it may not rival Instagram in the UK, expect its mixture of social sharing and collaborative photo galleries to be a hit closer to its home.iPhone Newsies Photo Booth (Free) Finally, a fun branded app from Disney to promote its Newsies Broadway musical, adding characters into your own snaps, then helping you share them. On a more practical level, it also provides news and ticketing details for the musical.iPhone That&apos;s this week&apos;s selection, but what do you think?

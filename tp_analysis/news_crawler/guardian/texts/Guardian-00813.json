    "text": "Environmental campaigner Tamsin Omond, 27, stormed the roof of Parliament with four other members of Plane Stupid in February 2008. I had left Cambridge University theprevious summer intending tobecome a priest, but was radicalised during the Climate Campat Heathrow  I knew a couple of members of Plane Stupid from university and went along with them in a support role, but ended upbeing arrested for obstructing aprivate jet entrance. Over the coming months, we came up with the idea of going on tothe roof of Parliament to protest against the proposed third runway. It was surprisingly easy. We did several recces and studied the roof on Google Maps to work out which window we needed to climb out of. On the morning of prime minister&apos;s questions, we strolled through the visitors&apos; entrance and an insider, afriend with a pass, took us into therestricted area. I was third of five out of the window. For an instant, stepping out on to the roof, there was an, &quot;Oh my gosh, we&apos;re actually doing this&quot; moment, a split-second of terror, and then we got the momentum. We got close to the edge of the roof  we didn&apos;t have anyclimbing gear  and dropped ourbanners. Because the police hadto observe health and safety rules, they couldn&apos;t get near us and we were up there for several hours. We wanted to be talked about in PMQs, and we were. I knew I wouldn&apos;t go to prison for aggravated trespass because Ihad no criminal record and was of &quot;goodcharacter&quot;. After we were released, I suddenly had a profile and wondered what I should do with it. I had been reading about thesuffragettes a few months beforethe centenary of the 1908 rush on the House of Commons, andwith friends started to think about how we might create a Climate Rush. Therush on Parliament in October 2008 was aone-off event but because of the reaction we kept going. My family are proud of me, but itcan be annoying for my partner ifI&apos;m waking up at 5am to get arrested. There&apos;s a level of ambiguity in speaking to her about what I am doing. It would be nice not to make her complicit in illegal things, but you have to prepare people as well. I don&apos;t talk about anything else, which makes me boring at dinner parties. I don&apos;t think activism is just a middle-class activity  most rich, middle-class people are ruining the environment. Opposition to incinerators and airports is not middle-class: Hampstead doesn&apos;t get airports dumped on it  Slough does.",

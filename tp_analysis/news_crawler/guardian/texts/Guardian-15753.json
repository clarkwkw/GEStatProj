The department&apos;s most recent project has involved &quot;pretty much ripping up the curriculum&quot; so that come September, the school will be delivering new content directly shaped by what professionals working in relevant industries have said are the practical skills they need from new graduates. There has also, Miller says, been a big push to recruit tutors who have had significant experience in senior management in the industry. &quot;When people come from Claridge&apos;s and the Dorchester, it means students really listen,&quot; he says. Edinburgh University  top for nursing in 2011, 2012 and 2013 &quot;Small is important,&quot; says Prof Pam Smith, as she considers what factors have kept Edinburgh at the top of the nursing table for the last three years. &quot;We only take 35 students, and it means we can structure in one-to-one mentoring both academically and clinically.&quot; A stringent selection process is also vital to maintaining standards, Smith says. &quot;Compassion and care&quot; are her emphasis. Fostering these dual attributes means careful planning of clinical placements  students are only allowed to do their elderly care and end-of-life placements towards the end of their course, when they can use the communication skills they have built up over three years. University College London  top for architecture for three years There&apos;s a danger in the virtuous circle created by being at the top, says Prof Alan Penn, dean of the UCL Bartlett faculty of the built environment. &quot;We get excellent students, partly attracted by our position, and excellent staff, partly attracted by the students,&quot; he says. &quot;The risk in that is always complacency.&quot; One feature of the department is that it has professional working architects running entire units of work, not just giving the odd lecture. In the first year, there is almost no sitting in lectures  undergraduates&apos; work is primarily collaborative group work or tutorial-based. &quot;It&apos;s really exciting for the first years,&quot; he says. &quot;They mature very quickly, get really creative and often quite competitive. If we have a problem, it can be one of over-work.&quot; New stars this year Northampton  a jump from 54th to 17th place for art and design, and from 54th to 18th place for drama and dance &quot;We test every decision we make against what it means for students,&quot; says Paul Middleton, executive dean, school of the arts. His goal is to become one of the UK&apos;s top five schools of the arts. Middleton says one of the keys has been timetabling sessions to listen to what students think about their course  and making sure it&apos;s not just the most vocal individuals who speak out. The department has also been involved in high-profile collaborations with Prada and Silverstone, the BBC and ITV, which have &quot;made a big impact&quot;, he says. And a determined effort has been made to woo the best tutors to Northampton. These are &quot;people with strong industry and research experience, but we are also making it clear that they have to have strong motivation to work with students,&quot; Middleton says. &quot;They have full teaching loads, and are on campus five days a week. We expect them to be available not just during contact hours, but for questions and discussions around that. This is absolutely critical to a good experience.&quot; Swansea University  from 40th last year to 5th place in sports science &quot;Maybe the best way of describing sports science is that it&apos;s the same as CSI [the TV crime drama], but it&apos;s the forensics of exercise instead of crime,&quot; says Prof Gareth Stratton, head of sports science at Swansea. &quot;We want to produce graduates who are scientists, using sport and exercise as a background.&quot; The picture for Swansea&apos;s sports science students changed in 2010, when the department was relocated  uniquely, Stratton believes  to sit within the college of engineering, rather than within the school of health, as would be more typical. This means, says Stratton, there is a tight focus on how sports science can be practically applied, using engineering skills to look at sports injuries, or, for example, barriers to an individual&apos;s movement caused by disability. This, together with high-profile internships with major sporting teams and venues, has made Swansea students highly employable when they graduate, says Stratton. Heriot-Watt  from 16th to 4th for building and town and country planning &quot;We&apos;ve been very pro-active in improving the student experience,&quot; says Neil Dunse, deputy head of the school of the built environment. In a sector that&apos;s depressed, the department&apos;s success in helping students gain employment  from around 60% four years ago to 90% in 2012  is impressive, and has contributed significantly to its jump up the table. An industry mentoring scheme now in its third year creates a relationship between students and professional mentors that, Dunse believes, offers undergraduates valuable insight into the sector in which they aim to build a career. Employers don&apos;t just look for theoretical skills, he says: they need people who can work in teams and put across an argument. The department has been &quot;very active&quot; in supporting its undergraduates to develop the confidence, presentation skills and ability to communicate  disciplines that give them an edge when searching for jobs.

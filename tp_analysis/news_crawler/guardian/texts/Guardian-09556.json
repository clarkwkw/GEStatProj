    "text": "A small boost by the ISS (International Space Station) on Wednesday has put it in the optimum orbit to receive the Soyuz TMA-06 craft which is due for launch next Tuesday. That Soyuz is to dock next Thursday, bringing three new crew members to restore the ISS&apos;s complement to six. Meantime the ISS is at its brightest and best in Britain&apos;s evening sky as it tracks eastwards at the BST times listed our predictions. Asterisks in the tables indicate the directions in which the ISS fades from view as it enters eclipse in the Earth&apos;s shadow. On its most favourable transits the ISS passes directly over S England but reaches only 64 in the S as seen from Manchester and less than 40 for watchers in Edinburgh.

    "text": "Dr Tom Scotto, associate dean of the graduate school and lecturer in the department of government, University of Essex Listen to your students and provide the help they need At Essex we undertake extensive training needs analysis so we can respond to issues students may face at different stages of their postgraduate studies and in their future careers. In response we are developing targeted short courses to cover the issues identified by students. Our surveys show students are looking for broad skills development in terms of professionalism. For example, how to get published in peer reviewed journals and the publication process. The support we provide includes recruiting our experienced academics to mentor PhD students and deliver short courses covering these issues. The &apos;impact agenda&apos; means we also offer skills training on working with the media. Our graduates may want to use the expertise they gain from their PhD for consultancy work so we organise sessions where guest speakers talk about how they have utilised their PhD in their career. More discipline specific methodological skills are another area highlighted by our students. We are fortunate at Essex as this is one of our strengths and we host the Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis which handles advanced training in quantitative and qualitative research methods. We have always trained students in this area, but more and more students every year are requesting this type of training and we are developing further short courses in response. One challenge we face is ensuring students recognise the huge range of services and support we provide. We have launched the &apos;Proficio&apos; brand to bring together information about the skills training, student placements, study abroad options and networking opportunities we offer. Brian Ford-Lloyd, director of Birmingham University Graduate School Networking opportunities are crucial From the moment new students get through the door we arrange for them to mix with other postgraduates. We also provide them with e-learning software DR Essentials  this tells them everything they need to know about becoming a successful researcher. We train them how to manage their projects as well as offering entrepreneur training through our enterprise network. We aim to give them every opportunity to develop themselves and their future career prospects. After the initial induction we organise a range of events throughout the year - regular networking opportunities. We hold a monthly Twitter competition where they have to complete a phrase such as &apos;how many PG students does it take to XXX&apos; a photographic competition, and an annual poster conference. The photographic competition is a communication and networking event. The students have to portray their research by way of an image. It&apos;s also great fun as the students come along to find out what their peers are doing. It&apos;s very sociable. It&apos;s quite similar to our annual poster conference. For this the students have to make a poster that describes their research in terms that someone from another discipline would understand and to give readers a real understanding of the importance of what they are working on  again, it&apos;s very much something we set up to develop students&apos; communication skills as well as to give them an opportunity to network and socialise. These events are peppered throughout the year. We are focusing at the moment on trying to improve students&apos; academic writing skills at various levels. There is a big demand for this and the starting level is very varied. We have a unit that works specifically with international students on improving their language skills. We also believe it is very important to support the academics who work with overseas students, making sure that they understand the problems these students most commonly face. Supporting the supervisors is perhaps just as important as helping the students themselves. Leigh Sparks, head of the Stirling Graduate School, University of Stirling Setting out a contract of expectations Around 20% of Stirling&apos;s students are postgraduates, so this is an incredibly important sector for us. We have introduced the Stirling Graduate School from this year to bring together and enhance the activities that we have designed to support all postgraduate students. We attract students through our research and teaching specialisations  we are different from most universities in terms of the mix of postgraduate programmes we offer, for example our aquaculture, retailing, media and finance and accounting specialisms are quite significant. We are working hard to create an understanding of our expertise and added value for being a Stirling postgraduate  this is what we are providing for our students. During induction we set out a contract of expectations, which lets the students know what Stirling provides and delivers for them and what we expect from them. We also pay particular attention to supporting postgraduates throughout their programmes of study. Academic and service areas help them develop the transferable and additional skills they need, as well as integrating support mechanisms to assist on wider personal and academic issues. This regular support varies by programme, by individual, and background, and is designed to help postgraduates make the most of their time with Stirling. Dr Stephen Parker, head of postgraduate studies and research student co-ordinator, University of Worcester We provide a high level of personal support for postgraduates. In the case of some of our vocational masters programmes we physically go to the student&apos;s place of work and provide one-to-one support. It&apos;s about developing a rigorous approach to helping them, and understanding their practice in a deeper way. We want to enable our students in their careers, to help them make a difference, which impact upon their communities. We are flexible in our approach to the modular system and appreciate that our students have pressures outside of their academic lives, so we teach at weekends, in the evenings, and in blocks  anything to help them balance their work and family lives and still get the best from their studies. We offer blended learning. Our use of virtual learning is developing all the time. We realise that our students need flexibility; they need to be able to study at their own convenience. There is a writer in residence at the university who helps them improve their written expression. Also, students receive one-to-one tutor support towards their dissertation, and about 80% of our postgraduates use the informal dissertation support group. This is inter professional, so improves their communication skills as well as combating isolation, generally providing peer support. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

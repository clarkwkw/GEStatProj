    "text": "Julian Baggini (Is it all over for organics?, 5 September) questions whether organic standards mean higher welfare. There are good reasons to believe they do. Firstly, the welfare requirements are higher. The rules of the Soil Association, a leading organic standards setter in the UK, require pasture access for cows. Laying hens are kept free range throughout their lives. Soil Association eggs come from hens that haven&apos;t been beak trimmed. Britain&apos;s organic pigs are not subject to mutilations such as tail docking or teeth clipping. EU organic rules require piglets to stay with their mothers longer, reducing health problems and the need for antibiotics. A healthy animal should need few if any antibiotics. In the UK, antibiotics are used by organic farmers only to treat sick animals. In intensive farming they are routinely used to prop up a fundamentally unhealthy system aimed at controlling disease in animals whose immune systems are weakened by stress. In addition to good welfare rules, the Soil Association, the RSPCA and leading researchers are pioneering practical ways to measure welfare outcomes such as lameness in cows and feather pecking in chickens. This will help give further assurance that higher welfare systems are actually delivering better lives for the animals in practice too. For all of these reasons, Soil Association organic standards recently came out top in Compassion in World Farming&apos;s analysis of welfare standards. Of course there are non-organic schemes and systems with good welfare  conventional free range or Freedom Food for example. Shoppers looking for higher welfare food choices should certainly consider organic to be among them.Philip LymberyChief executive, Compassion in World Farming  The conclusions offered by your article will come as no surprise to many current and former certified organic producers. When I first gained organic certification in 1985, I was not primarily motivated by maintaining healthy soil (that was a given) but by the need to avoid the unhealthy effects of using products that had been banned by Geneva convention for use in warfare  but which could still be sprayed on your dinner. As the Soil Association tried to widen the appeal of organic food in the 1990s it embraced the supermarkets, which would not appreciate one of their niche suppliers telling the world that 95% of what it sold would give you cancer in middle age, or dementia later in life, so the SA quietly self-censored its campaigning on the ill-effects of &quot;conventional&quot; food. Unless the Soil Association reignites this campaign, it will continue to oversee the decline of our movement. And if the SA wishes to understand why it is losing its licensees at such an alarming rate, consider this The cost of a three-hour annual inspection of my two hectares is 450 plus VAT. The cost of the same inspection for the largest organic farmer in the UK is 750 plus VAT. The richer you are, the less you pay  even the poll tax wasn&apos;t that bad.Ian MasonShrewsbury, Shropshire  Organic food versus non-organic is about much more than vitamin counts. Organic farming occurs in harmony with wildlife, using crop rotations to build up soil fertility. Conventional farming is reliant on agrochemicals and artificial inputs which negate soil fertility and pollute land, rivers and streams. I was once told by a conventional apple producer they sprayed their apples up to 40 times with various pesticides, fungicides etc. Iknow what sort of apple I&apos;d rather eat.Izzy LaneLondon  It&apos;s irritating when bright people choose to ignore the difficult bits while embracing the dumb bits of an argument. The goat farmer and science blogger &quot;Susan&quot; quoted in your article is misled by her daft US organic farming rules, which can militate against good organic animal welfare. And the presumably British farmer Roger has been selectively bred to say the sort of things that, as an organic farmer, I simply do not recognise. He appears not to understand animal welfare rules in his own country. Organic farming has had a civilising influence. Had it not been for those who stood up to the blanket use of chemicals in food production, who decided slicing bits off live pigs and chickens wasn&apos;t essential to get a good bacon sandwich or chicken nugget, and who thought it would be nice if cows could stay out in grassy fields rather than mucky sheds (and not eat each others&apos; boiled-up proteins), I guess we&apos;d be wallowing in more mad cow disease, wading even dirtier rivers, and keeping nanotechnology pigs in triple-decked fattening hothouses. The organic influence has forced other sectors of this sometimes grubby industry to raise their game.Tim FinneySwindon, Wiltshire  Julian Baggini&apos;s article on organic food overlooks one key reason why people buy it: we think organic tastes better.Mike FrostBristol",

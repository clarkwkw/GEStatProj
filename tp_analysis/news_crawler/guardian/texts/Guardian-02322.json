[I will identify this species in 48 hours]  Image: ctcctcctc, uploaded 31 May 2010 [video link].    Question: I am doing something a little different today. I am giving you a mystery bird that I&apos;ve narrowed down to several species, but I have not yet made the ID. Currently, no one knows what this bird is. But that&apos;s not the only thing that&apos;s different; I don&apos;t have a photograph of this Malaysian mystery bird, I only have an audio recording to share. But I know that you&apos;ve been waiting for audio-only mystery birds, and I&apos;ve been trying to initiate an audio-only mystery bird at least once per week, so if you know your Malaysian bird songs, then this is the mystery bird you&apos;ve been waiting for! Based on my own work on this bird, I&apos;ve found these clues:  the bird is a passerine  the bird is singing outside the recordist&apos;s bedroom window, so it is not too bothered by humans  even though it is dark in the video, this is the bird&apos;s &quot;dawnsong&quot;  the nearby habitat is either wetlands, brackish or coastal The recordist believes he&apos;s seen the same bird in daylight, and describes that bird as &quot;black with a white stripe&quot;. Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species based on hearing its dawnsong? The Rules:  1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird&apos;s identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints so others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints may read like &quot;inside jokes&quot; and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game:  1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.  If you have bird images, video or audio files that you&apos;d like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at The Guardian, feel free to contact me to learn more.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist email: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

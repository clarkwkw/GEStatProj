    "text": "We&apos;ve all been there: Christmas Eve, those presents you ordered (through gritted teeth) from Amazon haven&apos;t arrived. Either you brave the crowds for a last-minute dash to Waterstones, or Auntie Sue goes empty-handed. Unless doesn&apos;t Auntie Sue have aniPad? Few people realise you can &quot;gift&quot; apps by right-clicking in the iTunes store and, at the risk of giving free PR to Apple, I recommend it to lazy shoppers everywhere. The first port of call should be Touch Press, namely its breathtakingly good The Waste Land and Shakespeare&apos;s Sonnets, jointly produced with Faber. Random House&apos;s A Clockwork Orange will delight Burgess fans, and the Scrooges among you: it&apos;s been reduced to 4.99 for the festive season. London: A City Through Time (Heuristic Media) recently won the Bookseller&apos;s FutureBook Innovation award for best reference book app, while Titanic: Her Journey (History Press) was highly commended. Touch Press&apos;s The Orchestra, just out, is simply brilliant, while Dan Snow&apos;s Timeline WW2 and Battle Castles (Harper Press) reach the parts that TV tie-in bookscannot. For children, NosyCrow&apos;s apps are unbeatable, especially its award-winning The Three Little Pigs. Also excellent are War Horse (Egmont and Touch Press) and futuristic fairytale Khoya (Tank and Bear). But if you&apos;re still not convinced that apps alone make worthy Christmas gifts, perhaps the way to do it would be to slip an iTunes voucher inside the 50th anniversary hardback edition of A Clockwork Orange (William Heinemann) or a beautifully bound copy of Shakespeare&apos;s sonnets. That way Auntie Sue can have her cake and eat it.",

    "text": "Books to the ceiling, Books to the sky,My pile of books is a mile high.How I love them! How I need them!I&apos;ll have a long beard by the time I read them.  ~ Arnold Lobel [1933-1987] author of many popular children&apos;s books.  Compiled by Ian &quot;Birdbooker&quot; Paulsen, the Birdbooker Report is a weekly report that has been published online for years, listing the wide variety of nature, natural history, ecology, animal behaviour, science and history books that have been newly released or republished in North America and in the UK. The books listed here were received by Ian during the previous week, courtesy of various publishing houses.   Featured Title:   Hunn, Eugene S. Birding in Seattle and King County: Site Guide and Annotated List (Second Edition). 2012. Seattle Audubon Society. Paperback: 252 pages. Price: $21.95 U.S. This title is available from the Seattle Audubon Society.SUMMARY: Eugene S. Hunn&apos;s classic Birding in Seattle and King County -- first published in 1982 -- cast attention on Seattle&apos;s urban environs, rich shorelines, farms and fields, and the little-known wilderness of the flanking Cascade Mountains, inspiring a tsunami of birding by a new generation of skilled and passionate birders. This radically renovated edition documents 377 species, a twenty-three percent increase from the original edition, thanks to intensive exploration along the Cascade crest, dedicated scanning offshore, and frequent coverage of favored parks and open spaces. Today&apos;s birders will find entirely new maps showing time-tested birding sites as well as recently discovered &quot;hotspots&quot;; a comprehensive inventory of rarities; updated seasonal bar graphs; and analyses of Christmas Bird Counts, the Breeding Bird Atlas, and recent changes in the dynamic local bird life -- along with a stunning set of color photographs by leading local photographers.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: A must have for those birding the region! The only thing I would have done differently is that I would have had a Glaucous-winged Gull photo on the cover instead of a Savannah Sparrow.   New and Recent Titles:   Jameson, Conor Mark. Silent Spring Revisited. 2012. Bloomsbury. Hardbound: 288 pages. Price: $27.95 U.S./ 16.99 [Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK/kindle UK; Amazon US/kindle US]. SUMMARY: American scientist and author Rachel Carson is said to have sparked the modern day environmental movement with the publication of Silent Spring in 1962. She made vivid the prospect of life without birdsong. But has her warning been heeded? Fifty years on, Conor Mark Jameson reflects on the growth of environmentalism since Silent Spring was published. His revealing and engaging tale plots milestone events in conservation, popular culture and political history in the British Isles and beyond, tracing a path through the half century since &apos;zero hour&apos;, 1962. Around this he weaves his own observations and touching personal experiences, seeking to answer the question: what happened to the birds, and birdsong, and why does it matter?IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: An interesting take on the post-Silent Spring era from a British perceptive.   Brown, Lester R. Full Planet, Empty Plates: The New Geopolitics of Food Scarcity. 2012. W.W. Norton. Paperback: 144 pages. Price: $16.95 U.S. [Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US]. SUMMARY: With food supplies tightening, countries are competing for the land and water resources needed to feed their people.  With food scarcity driven by falling water tables, eroding soils, and rising temperatures, control of arable land and water resources is moving to center stage in the global struggle for food security. &quot;In this era of tightening world food supplies, the ability to grow food is fast becoming a new form of geopolitical leverage. Food is the new oil,&quot; Lester R. Brown writes.  What will the geopolitics of food look like in a new era dominated by scarcity and food nationalism? Brown outlines the political implications of land acquisitions by grain-importing countries in Africa and elsewhere as well as the world&apos;s shrinking buffers against poor harvests. With wisdom accumulated over decades of tracking agricultural issues, Brown exposes the increasingly volatile food situation the world is facing.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: For those with an interest in the future of humanity.

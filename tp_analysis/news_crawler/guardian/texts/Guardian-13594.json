    "text": "Apple&apos;s marketing chief Phil Schiller has made a surprising attack on Android, and by implication Samsung, just hours before the launch of the Korean rival&apos;s latest flagship phone, saying that the Android experience &quot;isn&apos;t as good as an iPhone&quot; and that services on the phones &quot;don&apos;t work seamlessly together&quot;. In an exclusive interview with the Wall Street Journal, Schiller says Apple&apos;s own data shows that four times more people switched from an Android phone to an iPhone in the fourth quarter of 2012 than the other way round. With Samsung using a wide variety of marketing tactics  teaser videos to intrigue fan sites, and hefty advertising campaigns in which it far outspends Apple  Schiller said that reliance on market share figures, which show Android and Samsung outselling the iPhone by a substantial margin worldwide, give an incomplete picture of the market dynamics. &quot;I&apos;m not sure that the estimates and the modelling accurately gives an accurate picture of it all,&quot; he told the WSJ. Samsung&apos;s new flagship phone, expected to be called the Galaxy S4, will be unveiled in New York on Thursday evening. Schiller&apos;s intervention is highly unusual: Apple usually declines to comment on rivals&apos; products, especially ahead of a launch. But with the company&apos;s stock under selloff pressure as analysts focus on headline numbers for Android sales and official activations by Google  which in total have now reached 750m since the mobile operating system was launched in 2008  the company has apparently decided to take a more aggressive stance. Steve Jobs, its former chief executive who died in 2011, would often take potshots at rivals&apos; products  memorably intervening during a financial call in October 2010 to dismiss the idea of smaller tablets then being offered by rivals including Samsung. But without Jobs, and with chief executive Tim Cook apparently unwilling to step into the limelight and attack a company which is one of its biggest suppliers, Schiller  who often takes the lead in product announcements  has spoken up, though certainly with Cook&apos;s approval. &quot;When you take an Android device out of the box, you have to sign up to nine accounts with different vendors to get the experience iOS comes with,&quot; Schiller told the WSJ. &quot;They don&apos;t work seamlessly together.&quot; That may be a dig at Samsung&apos;s collaboration with Dropbox, the cloud-syncing service for which Samsung offers free accounts with 50GB of space on its high-end smartphones. Samsung also offers its own services, separate of Google&apos;s, which it encourages users to sign up to  as do other Android handset companies. Apple offers its own iCloud service, which is accessed through a single sign-on when a phone is activated. Schiller also cited a ChangeWave survey saying that three-quarters of iPhone users were &quot;very satisfied&quot; with their device, against about half of Android users. Android phones, said Schiller, are &quot;often given as a free replacement for a feature phone and the experience isn&apos;t as good as an iPhone.&quot; The three iPhone models together outsold all Android phones in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the US, according to data from analysts. ComScore, which tracks ownership, says that by January 2013 there were 48.9m iPhones in use in the US, and 27.7m Samsung smartphones  with HTC the next largest, as 12.6m. But worldwide, Samsung dominates the smartphone market. Although it does not release official figures, analysts  guided by the company  reckon it shipped 63.7m smartphones at all price points in the fourth quarter. Apple meanwhile is under pressure to square the circle by taking advantage of the fastest-growing sector of the smartphone market  for low-cost devices costing about $200  while also retaining its reputation for high-end products and the high margins that attracted fund managers to its stock. The WSJ interview contains no mention of any questions relating to expectations about a low-end iPhone, which some analysts expect in summer this year. Apple used to make continual comparisons with rivals&apos; products  but that was back when it was a struggling computer company in the late 1990s. At that time it produced a number of adverts branding Intel processors as snails compared to the RISC-based PowerPC processors it used. (The adverts were never shown in the UK due to rules forbidding negative advertising.) More recently it made digs at Microsoft over perceived flaws in its Windows software with its &quot;I&apos;m a Mac&quot; advertising series  but discontinued those as the iPhone and iPad rose to prominence.",

    "text": "This month, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in human history. If the trend continues, the International Energy Agency has warned, the world could warm by 6C by the end of the century. In December 2009, the US Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, called the world&apos;s first Clean Energy Ministerial. The aim was to speed the transition from a carbon economy to clean energy production in the 22 countries that together produced 80% of the world&apos;s greenhouse gases. Clearly the scheme has not gone well. A report on the clean energy market by the IEA last month had harsh words for the countries involved. They account for 90% of global investment in clean energy, but progress has been slow, and their policies too narrow. The markets have failed clean energy, said the IEA. Research and development must move faster. For a series of posts over the coming month, I will interview six scientists who work on clean energy. Each has their own solution to the problem. All hope to make a difference. In the next post, I talk to Didier Houssin, director of sustainable energy policy and technology at IEA, about the challenge of energy production. The following posts will look at the promise of photosynthesis to make biofuels; high altitude wind power; organic solar cells; new forms of hydrogen production; and hydroelectric power. My posts will cover what scientists think, but I want to know your thoughts too. If you have questions or suggestions, please add them to the comment thread and I will raise them with the scientists I interview. I&apos;ll let you know how they respond.

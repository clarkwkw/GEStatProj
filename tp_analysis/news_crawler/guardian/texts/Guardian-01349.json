    "text": "The headlands stretch out into the bay like so many huge, recumbent beasts. From the cliff-top path heading south I search among all these shades and striations in the grey for familiar forms from Cardigan Island almost to Ynys Enlli in the clearing sky over my right shoulder. There are robins jousting in song from among coconut-scented flowers of gorse. Stray flowers of thrift and campion have somehow survived winter-long. Dinas Head and Ynys Ddewi loom vague in a far distance. Down among striped currents, shoals of bladderwrack show shadowy maroon through thick sea green. Pennyroyal and young green nettle shoots add their quota of colour to a predominantly yellow palette: hawkweed, tormentil, dandelion, ragwort, buttercups even, and so much gorse. You call this winter? It glows like the sun. There are goldcrests among the teasels, their sibilant calls counterpointing, enlivening, a soft hush of waves below. Sudden thumping timpani as one roller explodes into a rock crevice far beneath, then these frenetic little birds once again take up their lisping theme. A pale wash of cinnamon-inflected light suffuses the sky. Right across the great bay from Lleyn to Pembroke, the water&apos;s silvered and shimmering. From the high lookout bench I watch cormorants scud low across the water, and aplump seal rolls with the wave-swell beneath the cliffs. How can it feel so quiet when, as the ear attunes, there is so much of natural sound to register? As if to answer the query ghosting through my mind, here comes a presence entirely silent, gliding by. It&apos;s a fulmar, buoyant and graceful in its flight, unafraid. It harmonises so sweetly with a breath of a breeze off the land, the merest disturbance of air rippling it on its way. Old sea-hands thought them souls of dead sailors, so light do they hang on the wind.",

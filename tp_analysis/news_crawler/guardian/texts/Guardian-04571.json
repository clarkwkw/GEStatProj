    "text": "A friend tells me that he has seen, within the last few days, a good many painted lady butterflies in Hertfordshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk, and asks me if I have heard if it is likely to be a painted lady year. By that he means, have so many been noticed that we may expect the abnormal numbers, probably immigrants, which have made certain years remarkable in the annals of entomology? Insects, like birds and occasionally certain mammals, such as voles, show considerable fluctuation in numbers, and this year certain insects have been very plentiful. Some of the solitary bees and the handsome red-tailed bumble bee are examples, whilst the abundance of queen wasps is rather alarming to the fruit-grower. My angling friends have not told if May-flies are specially plentiful, but several of them noticed their early appearance, for in many years the May-fly is not on the wing before the beginning of June.",

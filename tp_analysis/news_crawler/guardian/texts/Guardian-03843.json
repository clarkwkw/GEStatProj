    "text": "Many people now tempt birds by placing nesting-boxes on their trees, and are delighted when the attention is appreciated. Birds, however, are not the only occupants of these shelters, at least they are not in a garden at Duffield, I am told. Last year three of the German boxes, usually the better type, had no avian inhabitants, but they were often used as day bedrooms by long-eared and other bats. This season an English-made box has two different sets of tenants. A great tit, now busily engaged in hastening forward the advent of seven little great tits, has its nest on the floor of the box, and an enterprising queen wasp suspended her cup-shaped nest from the ceiling, beneath the lid. Does her fellow-lodger object to her presence? Tits are accused of bee-eating, but this one has not sampled wasp. Wasps were plentiful last summer, and the nests seem to have produced an unusually large number of queens which survived the winter; wasps in moderation are useful, but too many useful things are often troublesome. A wasp killed now means one nest and many hundreds of individuals less in the summer. Many more of the delicate paper cups are constructed than ever develop into large colonies; in them the queen rears her first helpers, and they prepare the home for the ever-growing colony.",

    "text": "It is the age-old story of counter-revolution: not the restoration of the monarchy kind, but the intellectual kind, as the pendulum of ideas in development thinking swings back from the structuralism of the 1970s left towards the new right of the 1980s. Before we take a look at the nature and substance of this counter-revolution, however, it&apos;s worth considering what became of the competing ideas of modernisation theory and dependency theory. Underdevelopment theorists blamed the advanced countries for exploiting and so creating the poverty of the poor. Modernisation theorists saw the presumed weaknesses of poor societies as the primary barrier to future prosperity. Nonetheless, both approaches focused principally on the interplay of states and markets. As a result, neither fully captured the complex challenges confronting poorer countries at the time. Perhaps the principal upshot of this was what would become known as the &quot;impasse&quot; in development studies. This impasse led to considerable and often illuminating debates. But it was perceived by many at the time to symbolise a policy as much as an academic dead end. And, crucially, for a while it ceded the future to those prepared to come forth with bolder, brassier ideas. By the early 80s, that meant the new right. The new right was a broad church. Its ideological home was provided by the governments of Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in the US. But its practical levers were the institutions of the Washington Consensus  the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt, which would later become the World Trade Organisation)  and its momentum was provided by a more general sense of excitement about what is today (far too pejoratively) referred to as globalisation. At the heart of the new right project was a particular constellation of ideas and policies known as neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is often used today as shorthand for any idea that is pro-market and anti-government intervention, but it is actually more specific than this. Above all, it is the harnessing of such policies to support the interests of big business, transnational corporations and finance. It seeks not so much a free market, therefore, as a market free for powerful interests. In terms of development policy, neoliberalism often boiled down to the belief that an intensified globalisation was itself development, the two being inseparable sides of the same virtuous coin. Hence, instead of seeing that poor countries would be best served through appropriate targeted policies (limiting domestic vulnerability to the global market through protectionist measures like tariffs, say, as South Korea was doing), neoliberals claimed that  since global free markets were both the means and the desired end of development  the only viable object of development policy was to do whatever necessary to make local markets and societies &quot;fit&quot; with the new global imperatives that the rich world&apos;s drive to internationalisation was bringing into focus. Accordingly, neoliberal development policy was both radical and abstract and, like all such prescriptions, was to be applied strictly according to the instructions. That usually called for several policies. The local state was to do no more (or rather, no less) than facilitate the conditions for &quot;market society&quot;. At the same time, all barriers to foreign investment would ideally be pulled down, the domestic labour force would be &quot;restructured&quot;, industry would be privatised, and the profit motive would become the organising value of social life. This, in short, was the &quot;trade not aid&quot; approach to development. Get the market conditions right, went the theory, get that too easily corrupted (if not corrupting) state out of the way, and social justice and human development would follow automatically. Alas, such an uncompromising approach was always likely to come to blows  if not inflict a few of its own  in the real world. And for all that neoliberalist development policy may with reason claim to have overcome some of the problems of earlier development approaches  an overreliance on the state as the main agent of change, say  it soon become clear it had also ignored their most important lessons. Most neoliberals, for example, were convinced that the structuralism of earlier development economists betrayed an excessively political bent to which their own, more &quot;scientific&quot; theories were immune. It was precisely this sort of dogmatism that made neoliberalism itself so much more dangerous than the previous generation of ideas. Too many nations were to witness this at first hand in the 1980s. First via the rather callous settlement to the 1980s debt crisis that neoliberals called for (there could be no mitigating factors for third world debt, they claimed: even debt accrued illegitimately by former leaders for personal gain was to be paid back, plus the interest), then at the hands of the IMF&apos;s so-called structural adjustment policies (which frequently used poor countries&apos; existing debt as a lever for drawing yet more market-friendly reforms out of them). Though heavily criticised, neoliberal development theories are still alive and well in the halls of economic and political power today.",

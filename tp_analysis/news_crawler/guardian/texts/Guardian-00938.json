    "text": "You report (18 January) how Sutton Trust summer schools help students to gain places at an elite university. Eton College universities summer school was founded in 1982 and has now seen 3,409 students from the maintained sector through its doors. Students choose the subject they wish to read at university and are given 10 days of intensive tuition, as well as specific help with their university application process. The school is open to all students at the end of year 12 from the maintained sector and we have forged close bonds with certain boroughs, notably Hounslow and Tower Hamlets. Oxbridge success rates are high, at around two-thirds acceptance for several departments, and most other students go on to top universities, including Harvard. Our small (and subsidised) fee is remitted for students from families in financial hardship.Andy HalksworthDirector, Eton College universities summer school",

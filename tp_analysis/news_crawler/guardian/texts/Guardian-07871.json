The species is listed as critically endangered and has seen a population decline of more than 80% over the last 10 years, believed to be because of habitat loss, over-collection and the chytrid fungus disease that is threatening amphibian populations worldwide. They are now believed to be extinct in the wild, but a number of zoos are running successful breeding programmes that aim to keep the species alive. In 2010, the the national assembly of Panama passed a law that honours the significance of these frogs - a symbol of good luck - designating August 14 as Golden Frog day Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters       Purple viper's bugloss and corn marigold. Some of the UK's rarest countryside flowers  have been putting on a stunning show this summer at Adrian Thomas's arable farm near Land's End in Cornwall Photograph: Marina Rule/National Trust/PA       An adult male blue iguana in the Queen Elizabeth II botanic park on Grand Cayman Island. Roughly 700 blue iguanas breed and roam free in protected woodlands on the eastern side of Grand Cayman in the western Caribbean, the only place where the critically endangered animals are found in the wild Photograph: Will Burrard-Lucas/Cayman Islands Department of Tourism/AP       A hippopotamus opens its mouth wide in a river in Tanzania's Serengeti national park Photograph: Noor Khamis/Reuters       A clear display of 'gorilla joy' was seen by keepers at a safari park in Wiltshire as two brothers were reunited after more than two years apart Photograph: Ian Turner/BNPS       A Hankow willow forest planted as a windbreak in Tongliao City, north China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. The Hankow willow is a tall, hardy perennial deciduous tree that has high drought tolerance. Exceptionally fast-growing, it is but prone to cankers and other diseases as it has brittle branches. Due to these traits, these willows planted usually have strange forms and appearances Photograph: Zhao Tingting/Corbis       A monarch butterfly rests on a tree branch on in Montpelier, Vermont. Every year thousands of these black and tan coloured butterflies fly up to 4,800km south from their home in the Rocky Mountains to spend the North American winter in Mexico and southern California. But  this year, ecologists in Kansas and Missouri say extreme temperatures in the midwest could hurt their southern migration Photograph: Toby Talbot/AP       Yao Ming  observes northern white rhinos at Ol-Pejetta conservancy  in Kenya. The former NBA player has travelled to Africa for the first time as global ambassador for WildAid. His conservation mission involves coming face-to-face with elephants and rhinos and documenting the poaching crisis that is a result of growing Asian demand for rhino horn and ivory products Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images       A sand kitten at the Ramat Gan Safari near Tel Aviv. Four sand cats (Felis margarita), considered extinct in Israel, were born three weeks ago at the zoo Photograph: Nir Elias/REUTERS       A Bali mynah chick in Chicago's Lincoln Park zoo, one of three that  hatched in July. Bali mynahs are among the world's rarest birds. This is  the first time in 12 years that the zoo has seen a successful hatching of the birds. The zoo says there are only 115 wild birds on its native range on Indonesia's island of Bali and an estimated 1,000 more in captivity Photograph: Todd Rosenberg/AP       Florida Museum of Natural History researchers examine the anatomy of the biggest Burmese python ever caught in Florida, over five metres (17ft) long and weighing 74kg (11st 9lb). Found in Everglades national park, the snake was pregnant with 87 eggs, also said to be a record. Scientists said the python's stats show just how pervasive the invasive snakes, which are native to south-east Asia, have become in south Florida.

These invertebrates were wiped out on their island home nearly 100 years ago by rats. But nearly 10 years ago a tiny colony was discovered clinging to a cliff on a rocky outcrop just off the island and two were taken to Melbourne zoo for breeding Photograph: Joe Castro/EPA       A red-eyed frog  during the national Golden Frog festival in Panama Photograph: Carlos Jasso/REUTERS       Branched bur-reed, by AlvecoteWood, one of the images from this month's Green shoots reader photographs gallery   Photograph: Flickr       The blue-crowned laughing thrush is among the top 10 species that are fighting extinction with the help of zoos. The population numbers less than 250 mature birds in the wild in China, with trapping for the bird trade a major cause of the species' recent decline  Photograph: Xie Xiao-fang/BIAZA       Unusually hot, dry weather in Manitoba, Canada, and lightning strikes have  caused several fires through Wapusk national park. The fires are threatening the habitat of polar bears, according to a conservation expert, encroaching on the old tree roots and frozen soil where females make their dens Photograph: Daniel J. Cox/NaturalExposures.com/Reuters       Polar bears are more typically threatened by the melting of sea ice, which they use as platforms for hunting seals, their main prey. But those who live near Hudson Bay spend their summers resting up on shore when the bay thaws, living in dens dug in the frozen soil among the roots of stunted spruce trees Photograph: Daniel J. Cox/NaturalExposures.com/Reuters       A mutated adult pale grass blue (Zizeeria maha) butterfly from Fukushima prefecture, Japan. A butterfly study is the first to definitively link Fukushima radiation to physical mutations in any organism Photograph: Joji Otaki/EPA       A Caribbean flamingo hatchling sits in a nest with its mother at the Bronx zoo in New York Photograph: Julie Larsen Maher/WCS/Reuters       Nomad Basang's flock in Ali, Tibet. The Basang family will travel from Ali area to the Nagqu area due to the lack of rainfall Photograph: Lai Xinlin/Corbis       A giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) searching for termites in Pantanal, Brazil. Jaguars, tapirs, giant anteaters and spider monkeys have become 'virtually extinct' in Brazil's Atlantic forest, while other species are being lost faster than previously believed due to the fragmentation and emptying of the once dense canopy by farmers and hunters, according to research published this week Photograph: Frans Lanting/Corbis       Another stunning image from this week's Green shoots gallery, by buffarches  Photograph: Flickr  ",

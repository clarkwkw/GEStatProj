    "text": "I have a box of vintage round discs, each in its own jacket. They are labelled and are photos of family subjects. I would love to have the pictures put on a DVD, but I don&apos;t know what these discs are called, and I don&apos;t know what type of camera they came from. I am enclosing a picture of one.Lynn This happens to be connected to my past life as an editor of photographic magazines. The disc is from a disc camera, a format Kodak launched in 1982 to replace 110 film cartridges. At the time, photo processing labs joined together thousands of films to run them through their machinery, then cut them up later. Kodak&apos;s idea was that discs could be loaded onto rods, cutting out the joining and splitting operations. Unfortunately, the negatives measured roughly 8 x 11mm  the same size used by famous Minox subminiature &quot;spy cameras&quot;  so standard enprints were very poor quality, and enlargements were grainy. At 85mm2, each disc negative was only one tenth of the area of a 35mm negative (864mm2), which was already considered small. The system was soon discontinued, and Kodak stopped supplying films at the end of 1999. You can still get prints made, and your local camera store or photo processing shop (you live in the state of Maine, USA) may be able to send them away to a specialist company for printing and scanning. Examples include the Rapid Photo Imaging Center in the US and MS Hobbies in the UK. Discs don&apos;t fit standard negative scanners so scanning isn&apos;t simple, and the negatives may be dirty or fading, so they may need cleaning, and the scans may need colour correction. Film Rescue International specialises in this sort of thing, and its base prices are reasonable: it will transfer one to five discs to CD-R for $25 plus $10 for US post and packing. A CD-R with prints costs $30. If you have lots of discs, there are discounts for quantity. Another American company, Old Photo, scans Kodak discs for $39 each. Whether it&apos;s worth it depends on the sentimental value of the photographs. As I said, the quality is likely to be quite poor, because of the small size of the negatives, and because they may have degraded over the past 20 or even 30 years. In general, I&apos;d expect rescue operations to get more difficult and more expensive with the passing of time. This applies to odd sizes and formats of floppy disk and audio tape as well as to photographic negatives. If you are ever going to do it, do it now. Importing a French TV I read your very informative article on Freeview or Freesat: which to choose? I am planning to buy a new TV as mine is on the blink. However, I live in France, so have to have Freesat, but I am planning to come back to the UK in the near future. Can TVs have both?Virginia Yes, TVs can have both Freesat and Freeview, but these services can be added to any TV set using cheap set-top boxes. This isn&apos;t quite as tidy, but it is more flexible. Also, it&apos;s easier to upgrade a set-top box than an integrated TV set. A French digital TV should work in the UK, though I&apos;m not sure about things like red button services. Most flat-screen TVs are made in Asia and are designed to handle the needs of as many countries as possible. However, they are usually set up for sale in local markets. If you buy one that lets you select a country setting, under a heading such as &apos;Digital channel country location&apos;, then it should set up local channels in a usable format. Some suppliers may lock the country setting, and possibly require you to type in a PIN, so it&apos;s a good idea to run some web searches before you buy a particular model. I believe the Freesat setup in the UK asks you to type in a post code, though I don&apos;t know what happens in France. Also, I&apos;m not sure if French TVs can handle the DVB-T2 system used for Freeview HDTV in the UK. Fortunately, there are Ask Jack readers who know more about this than I do, so check the comments below for clarification. If you&apos;re moving in a few months, it would probably be safer to buy a cheap (small or second-hand) TV in France and resell it before leaving. That will also save transporting it. If you buy a new TV in the UK, I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s worth getting one that includes Freesat as well as the usual built-in Freeview tuner. It will restrict your choice to relatively few HDTV models, as listed on the Freesat website. Start with Freeview and add a Freesat box plus satellite dish if you need one. This might be because your Freeview reception is poor or non-existent, your choice of Freeview channels is limited (eg if you are in a &apos;Freeview Light&apos; area), or you need channels that are only available on Freesat or the commercial Freesat from Sky version. UK Free TV lists the various channels available. If you click the &apos;compare TV&apos; tab, it will tell you which channels are not available on the rival service. Which all-in-one PC TV?      Sony's SVL2412Z1EB model offers easy switching to TV    I have read some of your advice about all-in-ones and wondered if you could give me a little advice. I have been looking at the Samsung Series 7 DP700A7D compared with the Sony SVL2412Z1EB. Spec-wise they both appear very high. The Sony model offers a great computer with the capability of easy switching to TV. The Samsung simply says it has a TV tuner.John Buckingham I have not tested these two Windows 8 all-in-ones, only looked at them in PC World (where they now seem to be out of stock). I think your best bet is to do the same, as one may attract you more than the other. While I&apos;m undoubtedly a fan of Amazon and other online shopping sites, I prefer hands-on experience if I&apos;m spending around 1,500. I also like to be able to stick something in the back of the car and take it back to the shop. Both of these Windows 8 PCs have Intel Core i7 processors, 8GB of memory, Blu-ray drives, and a full HD screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The Sony has a slight edge in having a 2TB hard drive instead of 1TB. However, as you appreciate, the Sony is the only all-in-one PC that works like a TV set: it has a physical TV switch, and a TV remote control. (Sony says it uses Bravia technology, whatever that means.) The Sony also costs more. In fact, the Sony Vaio L with a 24in screen (1,649.99) costs more than the Samsung Series 7 with a 27in screen (1,499.99). The Samsung is a PC with a built-in TV tuner, which is the traditional approach. However, if you want to use the PC like a TV set, the Sony looks like the best choice.",

    "text": "&quot;For many children, what goes on in the laboratory contributes little to their understanding of science&quot;. This was the damning conclusion of Dr Derek Hodson, a leading science education researcher. Hodson is not the only one to raise concerns about the value of practical work in science education and I have written for Guardian Science before about the suspicion that the popularity of practical lessons, both with students and teachers, may not have much to do with their educational value. That particular piece got a mixed response from readers, with some commenters ignoring the evidence and stating flatly that they &quot;totally&quot; disagreed with me. I can&apos;t help but feel that it&apos;s a little worrying when science teachers ignore the evidence in favour of their personal feelings about how things are and should be.            Definitely not ignoring the evidence are the Society of Biology, the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Institute of Physics, which have teamed up with the Nuffield Foundation to &quot;explore how teaching and learning approaches which have been shown to be effective in science education can be applied to practical work&quot;. They&apos;re working together to create resources to help teachers make more effective use of practical lessons and one of the first resources they&apos;ve produced is the video above, which will hopefully get teachers thinking about the issue.",

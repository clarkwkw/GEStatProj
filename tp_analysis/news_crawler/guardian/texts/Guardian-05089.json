    "text": "The reappearance of the International Space Station in Britain&apos;s evening sky gives us opportunities to compare it with the brightest planets, Venus and Jupiter, and the brightest star Sirius. Our predictions give the transit times for the ISS as seen from London and Manchester, with asterisks flagging the directions in which it disappears into the Earth&apos;s shadow as it tracks eastwards. Sirius, magnitude -1.5 on the astronomers&apos; brightness scale, twinkles in the lower SE sky at these times. Jupiter, twice as bright at magnitude -2.2, stands in our mid-SW sky, above and left of the brilliant magnitude -4.2 of Venus. The ISS may surpass Jupiter on its higher transits, but will it rival Venus?

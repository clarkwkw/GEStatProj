    "text": "The former Everton and Manchester City defender Michael Ball has been fined 6,000 by the Football Association for homophobic comments posted on Twitter. Ball messaged the Coronation Street actor Antony Cotton, who is openly gay and plays the factory worker Sean Tully in the long-running soap opera. Cotton was at the time appearing in I&apos;m a Celebrity  Get Me Out of Here! &quot;That fucking queer,&quot; Ball wrote. &quot;Get back to your sewing machine in Corrie you moaning bastard.&quot; The message has since been deleted. Ball, who won a single England cap under Sven-Goran Eriksson, the man who signed him for Leicester, in 2001, admitted improper conduct. The 32-year-old has been warned about his future behaviour. Ball&apos;s latest club, Leicester City, terminated the player&apos;s contract on Monday, but have insisted that their decision was based solely on footballing grounds. Ball signed a one-year deal after a successful trial last summer, but has played just three times this season, all of them in the Carling Cup, and not at all since September.",

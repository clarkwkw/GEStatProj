    "text": "Where&apos;s My Water isn&apos;t just notable for being the 25 billionth download from Apple&apos;s App Store. When it launched in September 2011, its alligator hero Swampy became the first new Disney character to be launched in a mobile game, rather than in another entertainment medium. The significance shouldn&apos;t be overblown Swampy isn&apos;t appearing on cinema screens just yet but the sight of Disney launching a new character on mobile and supporting him through its other channels is interesting. &quot;In China, we&apos;re introducing Disney, and one of the important vehicles is Swampy,&quot; says Bart Decrem, senior vice president and general manager of Disney Mobile, who joined the company in July 2010 when it acquired his apps startup Tapulous (of Tap Tap Revenge fame). &quot;The company is really supporting it, with t-shirts and documentaries on the Disney Channel, and YouTube stuff. It&apos;s not something I could do if we were a little startup.&quot; Disney hasn&apos;t released sales or download figures for Where&apos;s My Water, which is available in free and paid versions for iOS and Android. Decrem gives a hint at its scale, though. &quot;When we started Tapulous, I told our investors we&apos;d get 1m users in 18 months. We got them in 20 days. And this thing [Where&apos;s My Water] is exponentially bigger and faster. It&apos;s already bigger as a business than Tap Tap Revenge.&quot; The game was created by an internal development team of 5-6 people in six months, according to Decrem, who says they now have creative ownership of the Swampy character, including approving marketing collateral and merchandise. He says the aim was to create a startup-like environment to develop the game, but then capitalise on Disney&apos;s network to promote it.  Alongside that, Decrem&apos;s Disney Mobile team is figuring out how best to bring the company&apos;s established characters to mobile in interesting ways. &quot;We&apos;re going to build 10 games over the course of the year, trying to bring Disney characters to life in cool new ways, or create new Disney characters,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m excited about both. There is so much power in Disney characters, but what you have to do is build a fun game with great mechanics, and also think about the characters you have, and placing them in a world that makes sense.&quot; As someone who&apos;s been involved in iOS apps since before the official beginning Tap Tap Revenge was originally developed for jailbroken iPhones in 2007, before being acquired by Tapulous and rebranded for the launch of the App Store in July 2008 Decrem has a good perspective on how the store has evolved. &quot;In any ecosystem the barriers to entry grow up, discoverability becomes a bigger issue, and distribution consolidates around a number of key players over time,&quot; he says. &quot;Some of that is going on, but you&apos;re also seeing something like Temple Run shoot to number one, which is made by three people who are just loving what they do. Apple is doing a fantastic job at managing an ecosystem that rewards quality.&quot; He admits that there are challenges, particularly the cat-and-mouse game of dealing with companies and tools that try to game the App Store rankings system. Decrem is also interesting on the explosion in freemium business models in the mobile games industry something Tapulous was early into with Tap Tap Revenge. &quot;2011 was all about builder and RPG-sim games being freemium, but 2012 is about any game genre Infinity Blade core-style, word games, puzzle games Any kind of gameplay will get a freemium wrapper,&quot; he says. That&apos;s even more the case in countries like China, adds Decrem, where a lot of iPhones are jailbroken, and very few Android handsets have a credit-card associated with the user&apos;s account. &quot;There are a lot of places where it&apos;s very hard to monetise a paid game, so by necessity freemium is going to be the dominant model,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, we can&apos;t just put a freemium model on top of Swampy without thinking hard about the gameplay. But the cool thing here is that it&apos;s at least as important to create new IP and introduce Disney to new countries.&quot; He continues: &quot;Somebody&apos;s going to build a game that reaches 1bn people. That&apos;s a big deal, even though the economics are small by Disney&apos;s standards. We can reach 1bn people at near-no cost. Boom, all of China knows who Disney is.&quot; One challenge for Decrem and Disney is that the &quot;somebody&quot; is likely to be Rovio Mobile with Angry Birds, which is currently well over 700m downloads. That company has made no secret of its desire to become the next Disney, although Decrem prefers not to comment publicly on that aim. You can surmise this, though: the scale and reach of mobile apps may have the power to create a new Disney, but the old Disney is still very much alive and kicking on mobile, with new characters as well as old.",

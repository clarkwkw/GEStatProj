    "text": "It&apos;s close at the top in this year&apos;s Green League, with Greenwich just coming in first place. Last year&apos;s star, Nottingham Trent, slips to 5th place  not because it has suddenly gone off the rails (it has lost a mere 0.5 points overall) but because others have simply done well enough to catch up. Plymouth is 2nd, while the University of Brighton jumps into 3rd slot from 21st last year. The biggest improvement comes from the University of Surrey, which moves up 67 places. Surrey has increased the number of staff devoted to sustainability and it earns full points on ethical investment, which is rare. It has a 100% green electricity contract and generates 2% of its own energy from low-carbon sources, including solar panels. Cardiff puts in a notable performance, too, rising 55 places. Among other measures, it has improved its environmental management staffing levels and gains points for having a carbon-management plan  and generally decided to make it a priority to get basic building blocks of environmental management in place, partly thanks to lobbying by students after last year&apos;s &quot;fail&quot;. On the downside, the biggest faller is University of Wales, Trinity St David, which drops from 68th to 119th. Aberdeen drops 48 places. Cambridge University sinks 28 places to 96th, while Oxford gets a third at 119th place.",

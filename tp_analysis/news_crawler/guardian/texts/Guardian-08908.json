    "text": "I&apos;m 50 on Sunday. But I&apos;m still waiting for the moment when I feel fully, seriously adult. There are times, however, when I get a big stab of feeling simply old. The signs of physical decline, you expect. As ever, the real hell is other people. Here are 10 things I hate about turning 50. 1. Hearing young people discussing the 1970s with the same sense of distance that I felt from the 30s, and not seeming to be aware that the 80s were &quot;recent&quot;. 2. Insisting beneficently on buying lunch for someone you have known sincebabyhood &quot;as a treat&quot;, while simultaneously realising you are patronising someone who can buy and sell you. 3. Being asked if your son is your grandson. Ithought at first I was being complimented on my &quot;grand son&quot;. 4. Chatting light-heartedly with a young, male shop assistant, only to see a look of panic appear on his face. 5. The word &quot;old&quot; always coming near or at the top of the list when people wish to insult you. 6. The gradual shift whereby more and more people &quot;in charge&quot; are younger than you, not older. 7. The helpful girl at Boots pointing out that there are great offers on the loyalty card if you fill in the senior citizen section  and just generally having to tick the &quot;50 or over&quot; box. 8. Explaining to the young folk how people &quot;managed&quot; when they were late, in the dark days before mobiles. And in my case, explaining that we didn&apos;t even have a phone until I was 10. The horror. 9. Films and plays you feel you saw just a couple of years ago being remade or revived. 10. Being called &quot;Madam&quot;.",

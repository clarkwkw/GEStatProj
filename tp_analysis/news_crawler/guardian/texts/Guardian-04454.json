    "text": "From Wednesday&apos;s U-turn on buzzard control, let&apos;s return to that U-turn-in-waiting, the government&apos;s barmy badger cull in England. It is intended to curb the serious problem of TB in cattle. But there&apos;s already a formidable case against the proposals - effectiveness, expense, legality - and now there&apos;s one more: the difficulty of counting badgers. Two of the UK&apos;s foremost experts have a letter published in the scientific journal Nature today arguing that our poor knowledge of existing badger populations presents a serious problem. That&apos;s because the culls have to wipe out at least 70% of the animals to avoid making matters worse, but it&apos;s impossible to know whether you&apos;ve hit this target if you don&apos;t really know how many there were to start with. Christl Donnelly and Rosie Woodroffe, who both worked on the 10-year Randomised Badger Culling Trial that remains the gold-standard research in the field, say uncertainties over badger populations mean a cull could result in anywhere between 50% and 100% of the creatures being killed.  If &quot;only&quot; half of badgers are taken out, there is a significant risk that fleeing survivors will increase TB rates in cattle in neighbouring areas, the so-called peturbation effect. On the other hand, if all the badgers are killed, the cull will have broken the Bern wildlife convention which forbids local extinctions and to which the UK has signed up. There are perhaps 300,000 badgers in England. &quot;But knowledge is not as good as you would expect, given that they are widespread and well known,&quot; says Woodroffe. &quot;They live underground and come out only at night, so it is hard to count them. Most people have never seen one.&quot; The pair&apos;s calculation was based on data from Gloucestershire, where populations are in fact much better known than elsewhere. Night-time surveys were done there using a spotlight to count badgers, but there is clearly an uncertainty in such measurements. To that Donnelly and Woodroffe added the uncertainty associated with trying to catch the animals and the random variability of a population.  The upshot is a huge uncertainty over whether the magic 70% cull number can be hit. The uncertainty gets even worse in places where population data is simply extrapolated from regional estimates. &quot;There could be much more uncertainty elsewhere, as there has been a lot more badger field work in Gloucestershire,&quot; says Woodroffe. This problem could be reduced, though not eliminated, if full surveys were done in each cull area, before and after the shooting. DNA testing of badger droppings or bristles can give good estimates of numbers. But, says Woodroffe, this would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and add to the heavy costs farmers will already bear for the culling, which the goverment already accepts will be higher than the financial benefits. Legal and political problems scuppered the planned badger cull in Wales, in favour of a vaccination programme. So the Badger Trust&apos;s judicial review, which arrives in the high court on 25 June, is looking increasingly ominous. The odds on yet another U-turn are surely shortening.",

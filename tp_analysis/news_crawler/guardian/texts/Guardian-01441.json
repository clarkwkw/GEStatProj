    "text": "Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has announced that Diablo III will launch in the second quarter of 2012. Speaking to the Guardian ahead of an investor call to discuss the company&apos;s 2011 earnings, he confirmed that the action RPG favourite will be coming to PCs sometime between March and June. The game, which revolves around fantasy-themed dungeon combat, is one of the most keenly awaited titles of the last decade. First announced in 2001, it has been through several major revisions, and now features a brand new character progression system, as well as fresh multiplayer modes and a destructible environment. The title also boasts a controversial Auction House which will allow players to buy and sell in-game items for real cash. This is one of two major Blizzard Entertainment releases due in 2012: new World of Warcraft expansion pack Mists of Pandaria is expected to release this year. During the investor call, Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime also told gamers to expect more news on the real-time multiplayer strategy title currently codenamed Blizzard DOTA. Morhaime said the title would bring &quot;unique design elements&quot; to the burgeoning DOTA genre, as well as well-known characters from all of Blizzard franchises. Details on the company&apos;s new and as yet unnamed MMO title are also due to be announced in the coming months.",

    "text": "The latest correctives to the feelgood offensive being stoutly prosecuted by the government, Boris Johnson and Seb and Co are a mixture of doomwatch forward planning and performance impairment fears. The health service is gearing up on a global scale for fear of epidemics triggered by the impending influx of overseas visitors bearing exotic ailments, while experts on respiration have warned that should the summer bring hazy days the capital&apos;s unwholesome air could stop champion athletes&apos; lungs from working properly. None of this will erase the beatific smiles of those who insist that the games will evangelise the life-enhancing properties of sport rather than encouraging people to get glued more tightly to the TV. But they ought to help concentrate minds on the health implications of large numbers of people breathing bad stuff in and out in a large urban space. The threat of rampant disease, I suppose, comes with the territory and should indeed be prepared for thoroughly. Airborne pollution, though, is largely avoidable, and London hasn&apos;t been avoiding it terribly well. A study published last autumn ranked London&apos;s air some of the sootiest in Europe in terms of a category of &quot;particulate matter&quot; mostly disgorged by motor vehicles. The Conservative mayor has repeatedly said he aims to make the capital cleaner and greener. Yet he&apos;s increased the amount of traffic in the centre of the city by halving the size of its congestion charging zone. The next 800 buses added to London&apos;s fleet will include only 52 diesel-electric &quot;hybrid&quot; vehicles despite the mayor having pledged that all newcomers would be hybrids by now. He delayed implementing phase three of the Low Emission Zone (LEZ) by over a year. His air quality improvement measures have been criticised as half-baked. Meanwhile his own study has estimated that poor air quality shortens the lives of over 4,000 Londoners a year.  Boris could learn some lessons from the Chinese. Their authorities, you&apos;ll recall, took extreme steps to save the Beijing games from smog suffocation, first putting a stop to all construction work then banning banning 50% of cars from the city&apos;s roads. London&apos;s air in 2012 is nothing like as foul as the Chinese capital&apos;s was in 2008. Even so, Boris&apos;s record on air quality gives grounds for Londoners to cast both their first and second preferences votes in the coming mayoral election campaign for rival candidates.  I am more likely to pip Mo Farah for gold than Boris is to take bold steps on London&apos;s air quality. What&apos;s in it for him? I somehow doubt that coincidence explains why he spent his first days on returning from his Christmas and New Year holiday advertising his sympathy for private motorists. Needing to respond to Labour rival Ken Livingstone&apos;s attention-grabbing pledge on public transport fares, he has embarked on making a large overture to Londoners who travel on four wheels. Media visits to the ailing Hammersmith Flyover and re-vamped Henly&apos;s Corner bookended his pledge that a new road tunnel will be built under the Thames within ten years. More car use means more congestion means dirtier air. The Olympics could have been an opportunity to argue for a different approach to road management in the capital. But that has never been one of Boris&apos;s goals.",

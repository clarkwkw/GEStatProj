    "text": "When Sir Michael Wilshaw took up his role as the head of Ofsted in January, he made it clear he had no intention of softening the combative style that marked his spell as head of the high-achieving Mossbourne Academy in Haringey. &quot;If anyone says to you that &apos;staff morale is at an all-time low&apos;, you know you are doing something right&quot;, the chief inspector of schools said shortly after he took up his position. Four months later, the hardline rhetoric shows no sign of abating. Last week Sir Michael gave another example of his own form of tough love for the teaching profession. &quot;Let me tell you what stress is. Stress is what my father felt, who struggled to find a job in the 1950s and 1960s,&quot; he told an independent schools conference, making it clear that he had little time for the loud mutterings of discontent emanating from the nation&apos;s staff rooms, amid multiplying causes of teacher resentment. The profession&apos;s representative body, the General Teaching Council, has been scrapped. There have been angry protests at a grab at teachers&apos; pensions, threats to boycott an attempt to bring in literacy tests for six- and 10-year-olds and loud objections to the opening up of teaching to people without qualified teaching status. The notion that teachers might in future receive differential pay according to performance compounded a growing sense of grievance. Wilshaw has suggested that 5,000 headteachers are failing their children. And he has proposed surprise &quot;dawn raids&quot; on schools, a tactic that heads say displays a lack of trust. Meanwhile, his equally blunt boss, the education secretary Michael Gove, followed him at last week&apos;s conference at Brighton College with a soliloquy on the &quot;sheer scale, the breadth and the depth, of private school dominance of our society&quot;. The message was that state schools had to catch up, or else. Gove has told teachers they are in the &quot;firing line&quot; unless they make sure pupils behave and succeed, suggesting there is a culture of low expectations. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that a new survey of 17,500 teachers by the largest teachers&apos; union, the NASUWT, reveals a startling level of unease in classrooms across the country. A third of teachers (34%) don&apos;t feel respected as professionals, a quarter that their classroom expertise is not valued, 77% have experienced more workplace stress in the last year and nearly half (49%) have considered leaving the profession. The testimony of Brian Cookson, 61, a geography teacher at the Friary School in Lichfield, Staffordshire, speaks volumes: &quot;One head of a year at a school said to me: &apos;You know I quite often feel I am at the bottom of someone&apos;s shoe when I speak to parents now and I have never ever experienced that.&apos;&quot; Wilshaw believes that Britain&apos;s schools have &quot;tolerated mediocrity for too long&quot;. The UK is ranked 25th in the world for reading, 28th for maths and 16th for science, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). &quot;Considering the investment that the UK makes in education, considering it is an advanced economy, the UK should be doing better&quot;, said Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&apos;s special adviser on education who has been previously praised for his work by Gove. But he adds that there is one key factor that makes an education system successful. &quot;The quality of an education system can never exceed the quality of its teachers,&quot; he said. &quot;And basically if you want to get the best people into the teaching profession, if you want to attract bright people into the profession, you need to offer them something and that something is associated with status. The status of the profession is of fundamental importance. The teaching job has become much more demanding. We expect teachers to personalise learning rather than teaching everyone in the same mould; we expect them to take over the functions of family. The stress often comes from teachers feeling left alone.&quot; Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, today will pledge to bolster the status and quality of teachers should Labour get back in power in 2015. He points to the example of Japan, where the role of teacher is sought after and held in high esteem. Along with South Korea, Finland, Canada and New Zealand, Japan is one of the top performing countries in education and newly qualified teachers can take up to a decade to find a placement. In Japan teachers work for their local authority, which decides where they teach and moves them every three to five years to enhance teaching at a school that may be in need of help and to improve professional practice by providing new challenges. There is little or no competition between schools for pupils but constant collaboration to ensure lessons are of a high enough standard. Teachers are encouraged to spend time researching and practising together to refine lessons in a process known as Kounaikenshuu. The government is hands-off. There are no national tests until the end of secondary education. Twigg points out the contrast. David Cameron&apos;s recent suggestion that children should stand up when their teachers walk into a room may have its merits but surely, Twigg says, it is up to the professionals to make those decisions. &quot;I don&apos;t think we politicians should be poking our noses into those sorts of issues. They are best decided by the school, in the school,&quot; said Twigg. &quot;I want to look at the evidence of what works, and actually a lot of the good things come from this country. I am not somebody who disregards good practice in our own country. But it is worth looking at some of those countries with a systematic sustained improvement in their performance in recent years. &quot;What is very striking in Japan and Finland is that teaching has a high status. I think a good starting point would be for the government to stop attacking teachers. In my conversations with heads, there is very low morale. The message from Michael Gove is often a kind of deficit message, how everything is wrong. I think that is not true and that is not the best way to improve performance. I think all of us who comment on these things need to take a very different approach to the profession. &quot;The sort of things people say about teachers they would never say about doctors. Both professions have their bad apples and you shouldn&apos;t base your comments on the extreme cases. Ofsted says we have got the best generation of teachers ever. We need to say that clearly, loudly and on the basis of consensus.&quot; Leslie Church was until February the headteacher at Downhills primary school, in Haringey. He resigned after what was an extraordinary episode in his 39-year teaching career. When the education secretary decided that Church&apos;s school should become an academy as it was failing to meet government standards, there was an outcry among its parents and a local revolt including an appeal for a judicial review. Gove&apos;s response was to accuse those standing in the way of being &quot;happy with failure&quot; and &quot;enemies of promise&quot;. Ultimately an argument over whether Downhills was letting down its pupils was resolved by a hastily arranged Ofsted inspection which backed the government line. &quot;The inspector&apos;s hands were shaking. She had a job to do,&quot; said Church. He now worries about the decline in status of teachers. &quot;When I started the parents would invite the teachers to their homes for tea. That wouldn&apos;t happen now,&quot; he said. Tony Hartney, the headteacher of the nearby Gladesmore school, in Tottenham, judged to be outstanding by Ofsted, feels the same way. Hartney, who was awarded a CBE in 2006 for radically transforming the school where 90% of the pupils are from an ethnic minority background, says that he has become alarmed by the government&apos;s attacks  and the impact they have on both sides of the school gate. &quot;If a parent didn&apos;t have a particularly positive experience of school themselves, then when the minister of education or someone in authority is highly critical, that reinforces a negative view and teachers have to work really hard to change perceptions,&quot; Hartney said. &quot;I think attacks on teachers who are working really hard are not very helpful. Teachers working hard are under stress. &quot;Of course it is not the kind of stress of someone being made homeless, or that kind of thing, but it is stress because teachers are highly committed and dedicated to helping the children make progress. Really it would be more helpful to recognise how dedicated the overwhelming majority are, and be grateful for their efforts, rather than hammering a smaller minority that are coasting. &quot;If teachers are coming in for a hammering from the minister for education that is obviously a big story and that damages teachers.&quot; And ultimately, say a rising number in the profession, it damages the morale of Britain&apos;s schools.",

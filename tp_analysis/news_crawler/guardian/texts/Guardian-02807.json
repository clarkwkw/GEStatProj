Our lab tests and visual tests agree with Apple&apos;s claim that the new iPad has &quot;the best display ever on a mobile device&quot; so we have awarded the new iPad the Best Mobile Display Award in DisplayMate&apos;s Best Video Hardware Guide. But there&apos;s more...the new iPad&apos;s picture quality, color accuracy, and gray scale are not only much better than any other Tablet or Smartphone, it&apos;s also much better than most HDTVs, laptops, and monitors. In fact with some minor calibration tweaks the new iPad would qualify as a studio reference monitor.   (Via Ars Technica via @rquick.) Download Adobe Photoshop CS6 Beta &gt;&gt; Adobe Labs  The world&apos;s best digital image editing software is about to get even better. Explore Adobe Photoshop CS6 beta for a sneak preview of some of the incredible performance enhancements, imaging magic, and creativity tools we are working on. Discover for yourself why Photoshop CS6 software will be a whole new experience in digital image editing.   First reports are very positive - notably that you can now search layers by name.

Apple&apos;s haptic touch feedback concept uses actuators, senses force on iPhone, iPad  In an effort to make touchscreens less static, Apple has proposed that future iPhones and iPads could feature actuators that would provide haptic feedback to users, and also include sensors that would measure the force at which a user touches the screen. The concept was unveiled this week in a patent application discovered by AppleInsider entitled &quot;Touch-Based User Interface with Haptic Feedback.&quot; The use of actuators underneath a touchscreen could allow users to actually feel elements on the screen, such as buttons or controls.   Actuators are lousy. That&apos;s what the BlackBerry Storm uses. Senseg&apos;s technology is miles better. Note though that the noise about haptics is getting gradually louder. We&apos;d hope to hear it for Android and Windows very soon. (Thanks @ClarkeViper for the link.) New iPad Wi-Fi issues seem to be software related, should be easy to patch &gt;&gt; 9to5Mac  We mentioned earlier that some new iPad owners were reporting issues with Wi-Fi. The problem seems to affect all models of the new device with both users of the 4G LTE model and the Wi-Fi-only model experiencing poor Wi-Fi reception. Many forum posters compared Wi-Fi reception with their other iOS devices and MacBooks on the same network:   ...unfavourably. We didn&apos;t notice any particular problems with the test version of the New iPad. (Thanks @rquick for the link.) You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

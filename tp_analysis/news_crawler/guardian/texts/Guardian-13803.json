    "text": "The British government would get better value for money from the hundreds of millions of pounds it gives to Unicef aid programmes if the Department for International Development (DfID) paid closer attention to the management, planning and delivery of projects, according to the UK&apos;s independent aid watchdog. A study of initiatives in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Ghana, prepared by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), acknowledged that Unicef is delivering results, but highlighted a lack of rigour and direction in DfID&apos;s dealings with the agency. &quot;In each of the five programmes we reviewed, we saw a lack of realistic appreciation of possible risks and constraints as well as a lack of clarity about what DfID is buying from Unicef, which blurs accountability,&quot; said the report&apos;s authors. Characterising the existing relationship as one based on trust and mutual benefit, the study calls on DfID to manage its engagement with Unicef more firmly and proactively, moving it on to a more commercial footing. DfID is urged to place greater emphasis on results and value for money, oversee local programme delivery more closely, and update the framework agreement governing its relationship with Unicef, which the report casts as increasingly anachronistic. &quot;DfID does not manage this important relationship in a systematic manner and uses a relatively light touch with Unicef compared to other delivery partners,&quot; said the authors, who noted that annual funding to Unicef doubled after it received an overall rating of &quot;very good value for money&quot; in the department&apos;s March 2011 multilateral aid review (pdf). &quot;Programmes are delivering results but there is evidence of delays and shortfalls, with some questionable value for money. DfID needs to provide greater clarity to Unicef with regard to the expectations of its role in each programme.&quot; Britain contributed 690m to Unicef between 2007 and 2011, the period covered by the report. To evaluate this spending, Icai examined five DfID-backed projects: a water and sanitation programme in DRC, two health initiatives in Sierra Leone, and malaria bednet schemes in Sierra Leone and Ghana. Overall, the projects received a &quot;green-amber&quot; rating under Icai&apos;s &quot;traffic light&quot; system, indicating that they performed relatively well in terms of effectiveness and value, but should be improved. More serious shortcomings were identified in relation to programme objectives and delivery, however, both of which were categorised as &quot;amber-red&quot;, signifying relatively poor performance and scope for &quot;significant improvements&quot;. A recurring theme of the study was the need for DfID to apply the same standards of evaluation to Unicef that it would to commercial delivery partners, doffing the kid gloves and adopting a more &quot;sceptical and challenging&quot; stance. &quot;A consideration by DfID of how Unicef compares to other service providers would give a solid basis for ensuring transparency and value for money,&quot; wrote the authors. &quot;Yet there were only two cases from the programmes we examined where DfID country offices formally considered an alternative to Unicef.&quot; Other problems identified included unrealistic programme objectives, a lack of clarity about what DfID funding would deliver, and a failure to scrutinise Unicef&apos;s financial and technical capacity at local level. Reservations were also expressed about the use of DfID funds for procurement through Unicef. The report noted that supplies obtained through the organisation were subject to a 7% cost recovery charge that would be up to 4% lower were Unicef&apos;s supply division used instead. A new framework agreement should seek to ensure the supply divison fee is used on all future projects, said the authors, who also acknowledged that DfID is attempting to redefine the relationship along more commercial lines. Both DfID and Unicef drew encouragement from Icai&apos;s overall green-amber rating, welcoming the report&apos;s findings. &quot;We are pleased that Icai has found that our work with Unicef is delivering real and tangible benefits for many of the poorest communities,&quot; said a DfID spokesperson. &quot;DfID is determined to get even better value for money and more effective aid from multilateral agencies, which is why we have improved oversight and stepped up our focus on delivery and results.&quot; &quot;Unicef welcomes the latest Icai report and the overall positive assessment of our work,&quot; added Martin Mogwanja, Unicef&apos;s deputy executive director. &quot;The strong partnership between DfID and Unicef makes a real difference in the lives of disadvantaged children around the world. Unicef strives continuously to maximise impact and value for money, and feedback on our performance such as that contained in the Icai report is taken very seriously and acted upon. We see this as an opportunity to improve our programmes for children, and look forward to our continued partnership with DfID and the people of the United Kingdom to address the pressing needs of children around the world.&quot;",

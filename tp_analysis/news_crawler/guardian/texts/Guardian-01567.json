    "text": "In January 2010, accountant Paul Chambers tweeted that because of snow at Robin Hood airport, he was going to blow the airport sky high. His comment led to his arrest, and has now reached the high court. On this week&apos;s Tech Weekly, Aleks Krotoski talks to Father Ted writer and Twitter aficionado Graham Linehan, and to Observer columnist Nick Cohen, about their views of the case and the ramifications for social media. Aleks and Charles also discuss technology patents and Microsoft&apos;s next operating system, Windows 8. Plus Charles talks to Intel UK MD Graham Palmer about the challenger to Macbook Air, the Ultrabook. Does it have what it takes to revive the slumping PC market?",

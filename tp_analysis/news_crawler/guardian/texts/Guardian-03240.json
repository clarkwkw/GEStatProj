    "text": "The search for extrasolar planets, those beyond our solar system, has been transformed in recent years by exploiting the transit method for their discovery. Looking for the minuscule dip in a star&apos;s light when a planet crosses in front of it promises to reveal small rocky worlds and even ones within the star&apos;s habitable zone where liquid water and possibly life might be found. Foremost in the quest has been Nasa&apos;s Kepler spacecraft which stares at a region of sky between Deneb and Vega and monitors continuously the brightness of some 150,000 stars. It is now three years into a mission that was initially due end later this year but has just been prolonged until 2016. The extension is good news for the army of citizen scientists who scan Kepler&apos;s data for the tell-tale dips in stellar brightness that might indicate or confirm a new planet  ones that might have been missed by Kepler&apos;s automated algorithms. Anyone can get involved in this venture by signing up at planethunters.org as did many thousands of others as a result of the BBC&apos;s Stargazing Live programmes in January. Our artist&apos;s impression shows an imaginary view from the vicinity of Kepler-16b, the first planet known to orbit two stars. Announced last September, it has the unofficial name Tatooine after the double-sun planet in the Star Wars series. Though it orbits near the outer edge of the system&apos;s habitable zone, it is Saturn-sized, largely gaseous and may be a poor candidate for life. Other Kepler finds are more promising, including Kepler-22b which is a super-Earth (2.4 times Earth&apos;s diameter) located comfortably within the habitable zone. Some have speculated that it has planet-wide oceans, but confirmation may be difficult even using the James Webb Space Telescope or the next generation of gigantic ground-based telescopes. Kepler&apos;s extended mission greatly improves the chances of finding Earth-like planets. To verify that any planet exists, Kepler needs to detect at least three regularly-spaced dips in its star&apos;s brightness. In the case of a planet like the Earth, in a one-year orbit, that would take a minimum of two or three years. The tally of confirmed extrasolar planets stood at 763 a week ago, of which 61 are credited to Kepler. However, Kepler has more than 2,300 candidate planets awaiting confirmation of which perhaps 9% may be similar in size to the Earth, with the rest larger. Estimates based on Kepler&apos;s findings suggest that our galaxy alone contains at least 50 billion planets, with at least 500 million within the habitable zone of their star.",

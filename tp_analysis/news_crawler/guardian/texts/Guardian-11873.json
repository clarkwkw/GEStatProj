    "text": "There is understandable public anger that some of our biggest supermarkets have been selling beef burgers and other products that contained horsemeat. People should be able to go into a shop and be confident that what they are buying for their families is properly labelled, legal and safe. But this isn&apos;t just about the supermarkets. The adulteration scandal raises important questions about how we, as a nation, trace, make and look after the food we eat. The first question for the government is why the adulteration was detected in Ireland and not in the UK? The Food Safety Authority of Ireland detected the illegal meat on products from two processing plants in the Irish Republic and one in Yorkshire. Why wasn&apos;t it picked up here? First, in 2010, the government split responsibilities for food inspections, creating a more complicated system for food regulation. The Department of Health remained the sponsoring body for the Food Standards Agency. The FSA retained responsibility for food safety issues and meat inspections. But food labelling and composition were transferred to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Why was no national system put in place to regularly audit labelling and composition to protect consumers? Defra&apos;s silence on the lack of a national system or process to check what exactly is in our food has been deafening. Second, the government does not like regulation. The Food Standards Agency meat hygiene service is being cut by 12m over four years. At local level, trading standards oversees local food checks and inspections. The National Audit Office states that funding for trading standards will go down from 213m to about 140m by 2014. Hundreds of trading standards jobs have been cut by councils facing huge budget pressures. This raises questions as to whether these services can protect consumers properly. Trading standards officers now have more responsibilities, but there is less money to deliver them. They are encouraged to focus only on statutory food safety checks and focus on high risk businesses like late night fast-food shops. Supermarkets, until today, were seen as low risk. These invisible regulatory services protect both consumers and food industry and allow it to export all over the world. Consumers who avoid pork for religious reasons will be shocked and upset that they may have unwittingly eaten it. Horsemeat carries a strong cultural taboo in the UK. It&apos;s not illegal to sell it, just illegal to not say that it&apos;s horse on the label. This scandal involves some of our biggest supermarkets and processors being caught out with flaws in their traceability checks. The supermarkets involved need to reassure shoppers that they have robust checks across their supply chain. The government too needs to come clean on whether its obsession with the &quot;so-called&quot; red tape is making consumer fraud more widespread and harder to trace? The UK is part of a global food supply chain. The food industry lobbies vigorously for a &quot;light touch&quot; regulatory system. Testing, tracking and tracing ingredients is expensive. But not testing them will cost us more.  Mary Creagh MP is the shadow environment secretary",

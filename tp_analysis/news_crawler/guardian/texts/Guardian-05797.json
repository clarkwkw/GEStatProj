    "text": "    This week&apos;s element is gadolinium, which was named for its discoverer, Johan Gadolin, who was born in bo, Sweden, which now is Turku, Finland. Gadolinium has the symbol Gd and atomic number 64. Pure gadolinium is a soft, shiny silvery-white rare earth metal, but like the other lanthanoids, gadolinium is not found in its pure form in the wild.    Gadolinium is not used in large amounts, but it is used for a number of special applications, including magnetic storage disks and compact discs, and its alloys are used in magnets and electronic components.  If you enjoy colourful elements, then gadolinium is a disappointment. Its absorption spectrum is not visible to the human eye, so it appears colourless and its compounds are a boring white colour.  But gadolinium is special because it has the greatest neutron-capturing ability of any known element. This ability to act like a neutron sponge makes gadolinium valuable in some types of nuclear reactors as well as in nuclear medicine. For example, gadolinium has been used to target tumors, especially in the brain, using neutron therapy.  Injectable organic gadolinium compounds are also used as a contrast agent for MRI, which allows doctors to better locate uncommon cell growths and tumors. Here&apos;s our favourite chemists telling us a little more about gadolinium, especially in MRI:            [video link] The most interesting thing I learned about gadolinium is that has no known biological role and is present only in the tiniest of quantities in most living things. Vegetables, for example, only contain two parts per billion (dry weight) at the most. However, some lichen types concentrate gadolinium in comparatively high amounts, as high as 500 parts per billion.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

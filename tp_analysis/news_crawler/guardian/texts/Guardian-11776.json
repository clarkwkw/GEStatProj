    "text": "2013 will mark the end of an era for social media fans as Microsoft finally kills off Windows Messenger, its popular but outdated instant messaging tool. After announcing in November that it planned to close the service, Microsoft this week emailed Messenger users to confirm it would be switched off on 15 March, from when Messenger logins will no longer work. Windows Live IDs are unaffected. Instead, Microsoft is diverting users to Skype, which offers instant messaging as well as audio and video chat. &quot;On 15th March 2013, we are retiring the existing Messenger service globally (except for mainland China where Messenger will continue to be available) and bringing the great features of Messenger and Skype together,&quot; said Microsoft&apos;s official email. Following Microsoft&apos;s acquisition of Skype in May 2011 for 5.2bn, analysts had speculated that Microsoft would move to bring Messenger and Skype&apos;s competing services closer together. Pre-Facebook and Twitter, instant chat applications such as Messenger, AIM and ICQ were hugely popular. Windows Live Messenger began life as MSN Messenger in 1999 and had more than 100 million users in 2010. Messenger will continue to operate in China where it is run under licence.",

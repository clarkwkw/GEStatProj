    "text": "If you think you&apos;ve already seen all the Angry Birds brand extensions you&apos;re even likely to, you&apos;re wrong. There is another. Due to be announced at the Times Square branch of Toys-r-Us later today, but now exploding all over the internet, Angry Birds Star Wars is a forthcoming themed version of the hit physics-based catapult game.  The game will be based around the Angry Birds Space version of the title, with the birds replaced by Rebel Alliance stars like Luke, Han, Ben Kenobi and Leia, while the stormtrooper pigs will be marshalled by a suitably porcine version of Darth Vader. The planets, of course, will be recognisable worlds from the Star Wars universe, including Tatooine and icy Hoth. The famous John Williams score has also been re-worked for the title.            &quot;They are not Angry Birds dressed up as Star Wars characters,&quot; explained Lucasfilm&apos;s president of licensing and consumer products marketing Paul Southern to USA Today. &quot;They are characters in their own right.&quot; Rovio revealed in May that the Angry Birds series, which debuted on the iPhone in 2009 has now seen almost 650m downloads of its various incarnations. The Angry Birds Space version, released in February sold 100m downloads in just 76 days, while a new spin-off Bad Piggies, took just three hours to top the US iTunes chart when it was released in September. And the game, which is hitting iOS, Android and PC platforms on 8 November, is only part of this lucrative deal. Bringing Hasbro into the equation, Rovio is also set to reveal a range of branded toys and accessories including an Angry Birds Star Wars version of Jenga with a collapsible Death Star and a range of plush figures, which look charmingly (cheaply?) handmade.",

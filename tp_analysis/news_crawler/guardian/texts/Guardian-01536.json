    "text": "Opponents of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline set themselves a new challenge on Monday  to gather 500,000 signatures in a single day  and block Congress from reviving the project. Barack Obama formally rejected the proposed pipeline last month, elevating a once obscure project to a leading issue in the 2012 elections. But Republicans in Congress are due on Monday to introduce a new measure that would force work to begin on the pipeline, essentially overturning the White House decision. Opponents of the pipeline are fighting back, with author and activist Bill McKibben&apos;s 350.org group announcing a new drive by some three dozen green and business groups to recruit 500,000 signatories in a single day to an anti-pipeline petition. McKibben said environmental groups had to defend their victory as Obama and Democrats came under fire for blocking the pipeline. &quot;It is clear that the fossil fuel industry is in an all-out push to get this done. Big oil never loses and they are determined to ram this thing through,&quot; he said in a phone interview. But he argued the election year fight over the pipeline could ultimately help Obama&apos;s chances of being re-elected to the White House. &quot;We are sending a message to the Senate leadership that the president actually did something brave here so back him up,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it&apos;s clear that as the president has taken bold stands in the last few months its has helped - not hurt - him. Clearly the oil industry is going to run ads about Keystone in the elections. It is time to make a forthright defence again.&quot; Mitt Romney and the other presidential contenders  who are uniformly pro-pipeline - have accused Obama of putting environmental considerations ahead of the jobs that would be created by the pipeline. In an editorial in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, Rick Perry, the Texas governor and failed presidential candidate, accused Obama of trying to &quot;appease environmental radicals&quot;. He also warned that blocking the pipeline, which would bring crude from Alberta to Texas refineries, would mean that that oil would end up in China. &quot;Obama wants us to believe he is for jobs, economic opportunity and greater energy security, and his Keystone decision does help meet those goalsfor the People&apos;s Republic of China. The American people get nothing,&quot; Perry wrote. Some inflated estimates have put the number of pipeline jobs as high as 50,000; an analysis by the State Department, which oversaw the project, put the number at 5,000. Republican Senators plan to file a measure on Monday that would link the pipeline project to a bill that would authorise more than $100bn in long-term transportation spending. Under the Republicans&apos; measure, work would begin on the pipeline immediately  except for a stretch through the ecologically sensitive areas of Nebraska. The Republican measure puts Obama and the Democratic majority in the Senate in an awkward position. The White House and Congress have been trying to reach a deal to finance new roads and bridges since 2009  and the current version has broad support. However, the last few months have also demonstrated strong opposition to the pipeline from the Democrats&apos; core supporters, liberal and environmental voters who oppose deeper investment in carbon-heavy tar sands. A number of environmental activists have warned Obama he would pay a price in the 2012 election if he did not reject the pipeline. Monday&apos;s petition showdown is a chance to demonstrate they have the popular support to back up those claims.",

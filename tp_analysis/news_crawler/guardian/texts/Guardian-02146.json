    "text": "As a new charity claims poor levels of numeracy are blighting the UK economy and ruining lives Alok Jha interviews maths populariser Professor Ian Stewart about his new book Seventeen Equations that Changed the World.  Professor Stewart is a recipient of the Christopher Zeeman Medal for his work promoting maths. In his new book he uses key mathematical formulae to explore a broad sweep of the great scientific and mathematical ideas that underpin our everyday lives. Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample takes a look at some of the big science stories over the past week, including exciting news on the potential role of gene therapy to combat life-threatening infections in people with an inherited immune disorder, a Lords report on the UK government&apos;s sidelining of scientific advisers, and new research suggesting that upper class folk behave much worse than the hoi polloi. Alok announces a very special live edition of the show which will take place at the Royal Institution in London on 28 March. To get your free tickets simply click here.

    "text": "Teenagers who took GCSE English and English language exams in England and Wales this summer are to be offered special resits in November despite the exam regulator Ofqual saying there was no problem with the marking of their June papers. The watchdog ruled out remarking the GCSEs despite schools claiming that the boundaries between grades C and D had been unfairly moved, resulting in fewer pupils achieving top grades. Instead, Ofqual suggested exams taken by other pupils in January had been too generous. But it was too late to re-mark those, it said, adding that lowering the grades of other students would lead to further concerns over fairness. Teachers said resits this autumn would be of no use to pupils who needed their results now. Union leaders resumed calls for an official inquiry and threatened legal action. Critics of the government believe its tough stance against grade inflation led exam boards to shift grade boundaries up. Chief regulator Glenys Stacey said: &quot;We are grateful to schools and colleges for bringing their concerns to our attention so quickly. In response, we have looked carefully at how the exam boards have managed the awarding of all GCSE English qualifications this year. People were particularly concerned about the June grade boundaries. We have found that examiners acted properly, and set the boundaries using their best professional judgment, taking into account all of the evidence available to them. The June boundaries have been properly set and candidates&apos; work properly graded.&quot; She continued: &quot;The issue is not the June, but the January boundaries. Most candidates were not sitting at the time, they were waiting for June, and because they were new qualifications examiners could not rely so much on direct comparisons with the past. As a result those grade boundaries were set generously. &quot;We have spoken to exam boards and they have been very responsive. Recognising the strength of feeling, they will be offering early resits for students who sat the June units.&quot; Exam boards will review the advice and guidance they give to schools about GCSE English including its structure, how grade boundaries are set and how they should be used. Ofqual said: &quot;Understandably, schools were over-reliant on the January 2012 boundaries to set expectations as there was little other information available to them.&quot; The regulator investigated after headteachers said 10,000 to 67,000 pupils had been wrongly graded meaning some could have missed out on sixth-form and college places. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the verdict of the regulator was &quot;extremely disappointing&quot;. Standards over the GCSE year had been inconsistent. &quot;Clearly the whole exam has been compromised by that&quot;. His association was still considering a legal challenge. &quot;This is going to leave all kinds of students with devastating consequences  Suddenly they have been let down by the system.&quot; About 1,300 schools had submitted evidence to the association, he said. Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers said: &quot;Reports suggest Ofqual knew three years ago that there was a problem in the examination system. This report does not recognise that they have let down teachers, students and schools. &quot;It still remains the fact that it is simply scandalous to change the grade boundaries halfway through a school year. There are thousands of pupils who got enough marks to get a C in English in January who have now got a grade D. &quot;Pupils should not be punished in this way because of the failures of the exam regulator or others. This scandal constitutes a real attack on these students&apos; chances to continue in education, employment or apprenticeships. &quot;Resits are of no use whatsoever to pupils who need their results this week, not in a few months time. This year&apos;s English GCSEs need to be urgently re-graded using the January boundaries which schools, teachers and pupils have all been working towards.&quot; Labour called for education secretary Michael Gove to explain to MPs what happened when the Commons resumes on Monday. Stephen Twigg, the party&apos;s education spokesman, said Ofqual&apos;s statement &quot;does not address the flaws that led to a situation whereby pupils in the same year, who received the same marks, were awarded different grades. As a result, thousands of pupils have been done a disservice at a time when they are making big decisions about their futures. &quot;Michael Gove must get a grip on this situation and come before parliament when the House of Commons returns next week to explain to the public how it came about that pupils could receive such different treatment from exam boards and to set out his plans for clearing up this mess.&quot; Andrew Hall, chief executive of exam board AQA, reposible for English exams taken by about 60% of pupils, said: &quot;Clearly there are lessons to be learned all round from what happened this summer While I was confident that AQA had maintained standards, it is reassuring that the regulator&apos;s review has confirmed that we followed the correct procedures and awarded the right grades.&quot; A review of GCSE English grades has also been ordered in Northern Ireland. Headteachers there also claim exam boards raised grade boundaries in English halfway through the year. John O&apos;Dowd, education minister at Stormont, said: &quot;I am increasingly concerned at feedback from schools here in recent days. It is vitally important that we can all have confidence in the fairness and transparency of the arrangements for marking and grading examinations.&quot;",

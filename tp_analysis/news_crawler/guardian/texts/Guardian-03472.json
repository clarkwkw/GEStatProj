    "text": "Steven Tall, development director of Education Endowment Foundation Get your fundraising email requests right: 1) The opening line has to ask the recipient for a financial gift. This may sound obvious, but you would be amazed how long it can take &apos;ask&apos; letters to get to the point. It&apos;s not rude to ask someone for a donation but it is disrespectful to waste their time doing so. 2) You must, absolutely must, have a P.S. (post-script). They&apos;re the second part of every &apos;ask&apos; letter I read from any organisation who contact me after the first line. So, your P.S. must re-inforce your opening sentence. 3) Ask for a specific amount today. Do you need a one-off gift of 50? Or 500? Or a regular monthly donation? If you don&apos;t tell me either you&apos;ll get nothing because I&apos;m confused, and/or don&apos;t believe you really need it; or you&apos;ll get far less than you were hoping for. Develop strong relationships within your team: The other crucial aspect of fundraising leadership of course is the quality and effectiveness of your volunteers. You might have a fab VC, a brilliant campaign chair and a great development director. But for a fundraising campaign really to fly all three must have good personal chemistry, complementing each others&apos; strengths and backfilling weaknesses. Focus on student sponsorship: There is one area of core funding where philanthropy can and should play a big part: student funding. We know donors are willing to put their hands in their pockets to help the next generation, both because of the old fundraising adage &quot;people give to people&quot;, and also because the amounts that will make a difference are within reach of most alumni (unlike, say, building projects). Establish reunion campaigns: Leaving gifts from &apos;the class of year X&apos; are, at best, sporadic in the UK. This means universities don&apos;t establish a conversation with alumni in which giving is an accepted part of the relationship until later. Not pursuing leaving gifts also depresses your overall giving rate compared to the US.  Paul Lanning adds: Encouraging and facilitating a culture of giving among current students - be it through a senior class gift program or class gifts competitions between all four years - is an important element of ultimately improving alumni giving rates down the road. Branch out internationally: Over the course of the &apos;Oxford Thinking&apos; campaign giving was split exactly 50:50 between UK and non-UK sources (primarily US, but not exclusively). The University also fund a 6-strong Asia office, with locations in Hong Kong and Japan. Oxford is, after all, a global university, it has major research outposts abroad and - Oxford University Press has offices in 50 or more countries so it makes strategic as well as financial sense to diversify fundraising activity into those areas. Match gift donations: Identify and approach a potential new matching funder from among your alumni or supporters - someone who is prepared to match new alumni gifts to your annual fund. This can be very attractive to a major donor because they see their support leveraging additional funding. Then work out a matching scheme that will incentivise alumni to make their first gift (always the hardest to get). You might skew it so that a modest gift of 20 would be worth three times that amount after gift aid and the match. Incentives which show potential donors how their gift can count for more makes a difference.  Richard Norman adds: The government&apos;s Matched Giving Scheme, which ran for three years between 2008-11, was a great driver for newer universities to establish - or give more attention to - their development operations. For institutions like Reading that had established development offices several years before, in the wake of the Thomas report, that period 2008-11 was one of significant growth. Resource:The Thomas Report set out the government&apos;s proposals for increasing voluntary giving to higher education. Paul Lanning, principal of RPR Fundraising, Los Angeles, USA Tailor your pitch to the donor: Institutions must demonstrate how they will meet (each individual) donor&apos;s goals and/or mission. The alumni tie is not always enough. Support must come from academic leadership: It is increasingly imperative that academic leadership work as teammates with advancement leadership to further an institution&apos;s development efforts. Most vice chancellors now realise fundraising is a core part of the job. They themselves may not have to be a brilliant fundraiser, but they need to invest in a development office, and invest in really close relationships with top prospects and donors. Resource: Philanthrocapitalism: How the rich can save the world by Michael Green and Matthew Bishop. Jos Kievits, director of development and alumni relations at Maastricht University Involve well known academics in fundraising campaigns: When your academics have a good reputation and present themselves well then this can help increase philanthropy. It is critical that academics show themselves to the outside world.  Paul Lanning adds: Whether it is visits with alumni, teaming up on preparation of funding proposals, providing discipline-specific expertise, or simply acting as advocates on campus for advancement initiatives, this partnership only fosters success, and where it is lacking advancement can be stymied. Richard Norman, head of major gifts, University of Reading Spend money to make money: Universities will sometimes make some form of financial contribution to the setting up of large multi-donor projects (for example, costs of drawing up plans and estimating work for capital investment) - but is a pot to match donations the best use of resources? I&apos;d say the better use of those funds if available would be to invest in asking more. &apos;I haven&apos;t been asked&apos; is still by far the biggest reason potential donors don&apos;t give. Adrian Salmon, Footstep Funds manager, University of Leeds Articulate a genuine need for donations: HEIs are generally not very good at doing something at which the rest of the charity sector does well - articulating a genuine need for donations in a way that feels personally relevant to the prospective donor. I have read so many university direct mail appeals that don&apos;t say - &quot;this is why we urgently need your support&quot;. There are learnings from the rest of the charity sector here, which we ignore at our cost. Far and away, the appeals that are most successful in attracting mass response of donation are emergency appeals. They articulate a clear, compelling reason to give that people can understand in a flash. Create a sense of belonging: Not just for universities but for every charity, those who foster the biggest sense of belonging to a &apos;tribe&apos; will have the most loyal, responsive and committed donors. Kate Hunter, director for CASE (Council for Advancement and Support of Education) Europe Branch out beyond alumni: We do tend to focus on &apos;alumni&apos; giving as the holy grail...but more institutions are making links with supporters of all types. I think it is encouraging to see that non-alumni want to support other institutions.  Paul Lanning adds: The single largest gift in U.S. history for community colleges came from someone who never attended a community college.Resource: Looking inside the largest gift in community college history Commit to philanthropy long term: One of the main challenges for the UK HE fundraising sector is to quit the ambivalence and stop-start approach to philanthropy. This is a long-term activity that universities must commit to, institutionally. Resources:  Ross - CASE study 2009 - 2010: Our findings  Can fundraising fill the whole in public finances?

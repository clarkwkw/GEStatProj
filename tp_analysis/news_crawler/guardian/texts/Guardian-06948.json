    "text": "Don&apos;t panic, I&apos;m almost certain that Nasa won&apos;t actually be using a games console to control several billion dollars&apos; worth of space gadgetry for their imminent &quot;Curiosity&quot; Mars mission. They have, however, created a free downloadable game, available for Xbox Kinect and in-browser for PC, to simulate descending through the red planet&apos;s atmosphere, a journey that has been dubbed the &quot;seven minutes of terror&quot;. And so it&apos;s down to you to deploy the parachute and heat shield, before safely landing the trusty rover so it can tootle off looking for signs of life by snuffling about among the craters. As well as excellent graphics, Kinect&apos;s use of body movement and gestures is fun and surprisingly tricky: features that are lost in the PC version. This isn&apos;t about intricate gameplay though, rather an introduction to space science, with lots of fascinating facts making for plenty of gaming time. Clever enough to send a robot to Mars, it seems Nasa&apos;s rocket scientists have also managed to sneak a spot of (whisper it) learning into a videogame.",

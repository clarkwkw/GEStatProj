    "text": "Every student should have the opportunity to do an internship as part of their degree, a government-commissioned report suggests. Sir Tim Wilson, the author of the review of university-business collaboration, said every undergraduate should do a 10-12 week internship in a summer vacation. He said: &quot;The world has changed. If you look at a lot of internships offered in the corporate sector, these are highly competitive. I think we&apos;re beginning to see internships being used as part of an extended interview process.&quot; Firms offering paid internships should be supported by the government through a tax credit or grant, the report will recommend. Where internships are unpaid, for unpaid internships universities should divert some of the funds intended to widen poorer students&apos; access to higher education  rather than let work experience be the preserve of undergraduates from wealthier homes, the report says. The universities minister, David Willetts, said this was a &quot;legitimate use&quot; of money raised by universities from tuition fees. The report also suggests students on sandwich years  a placement year in industry  should only be charged a university fee of 1,000, rather than the permitted maximum of 4,500. Ministers were told there was strong evidence that a placement year improved students&apos; employability, while lack of work experience was a &quot;key barrier&quot; in securing employment. However, the proportion of students taking up placements has declined, from 9.5% of all full-time undergraduates in 2003 to just over 7% in 2010. A small number of universities provide the majority of all the placements. Employers should also look again at the way they screen candidates for interview, the report says. Many firms use computer algorithms that limit recruitment to &quot;a particular set of universities [and] a 2:1 standard&quot;. This approach could have negative consequences for diversity. TheWilletts, said employers might be able to use kite-marking schemes carried out by professional societies instead of limiting their recruitment to a narrow range of institutions. The minister said: &quot;The Society of Biology is now in the process of kite-marking biological science courses. Could the algorithm that a large company like GlaxoSmithKline employ include: &apos;if it&apos;s one of the kitemarked courses that employers and business value?&apos; Even if it&apos;s not necessarily this particular subset of universities or this standard of degree?&quot; The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: &quot;The best universities around the world are building deeper links with business. The government welcomes much of what Sir Tim says and will carefully consider his recommendations in detail.&quot; Dr Wendy Piatt, the director general of the Russell Group of universities, which includes Oxford and Cambridge, said: &quot;Our graduates are already among the most sought after in the world and employers rank seven Russell Group universities in the top 20 in the world. In some cases  such as engineering degrees at Birmingham  employability skills are a key part of the curriculum. &quot;Liverpool law students undertake pro bono work and Manchester law students also offer innovative work place experiences. &quot;All our universities are committed to providing information to help student choice, but we are concerned that many of the report&apos;s recommendations  such as providing additional data on the job destinations of recent postgraduates  risks tying universities up in red tape.&quot;",

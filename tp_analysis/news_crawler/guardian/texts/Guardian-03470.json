    "text": "Campaigners armed with feather dusters and bicycles protested outside the environment department on Whitehall last night, in an attempt to put London&apos;s poor air quality on the map of the mayoral election. &quot;It is so important that we get out ahead of this mayoral election and start putting air quality on the agenda. Because it is this invisible problem we need to be drawing attention to,&quot; said Tasmin Omond, a member of Climate Rush, which organised the event. The protest underlined the health affects of London&apos;s air, which has been blamed for the premature deaths of thousands of Londoners, and the city&apos;s continual failure to meet EU air standards. &quot;There are 4,000 people who die a year prematurely in London. The air quality in London is atrocious. It is two times as bad the EU limit,&quot; said Elizabeth Whitebread, one of the event&apos;s organisers. The group accused the London Mayor Boris Johnson of lacking any political will to address the poor quality of London&apos;s air. His current measures to clean up London&apos;s air  which include effectively gluing pollution particles to the street  were labelled &quot;embarrassing&quot;. During last night&apos;s election debate on Sky News, Johnson defended his reputation on battling air pollution in London. &quot;I was the first mayor to introduce an air quality standard,&quot; he said. &quot;We had a legacy of poisonous air, that was left over and we have been cleaning it up.&quot; Green party candidate for the London Assembly, Caroline Russell joined the protest against the city&apos;s &quot;illegal air&quot;. She stressed the impact of poor air quality on the lives of Londoners. She said: &quot;Clean air is absolutely fundamental to the liveability of this city. People are really feeling the impact of bad air on their everyday lives. It reached the level where even healthy members of the population are supposed to avoid serious exercise outdoors,&quot; she said. The protest was also joined by Alan Andrews, environmental lawyer with Client Earth, who has taken the case for cleaner London air to court. &quot;We are going to be in the court of appeal on May 29, when we are going to be calling on the court to force the government to clean up Britain&apos;s air quality for 2015.&quot; Andrews said he took the case because the government&apos;s air pollution policy is moving backwards. &quot;The government is really doing nothing. It is not coming up with any new policies and in its &apos;red tape challenge&apos; it said in 2013 it is going to lobby to weaken the EU directive [on air pollution],&quot; he said. The protesters urged the next mayor move to meaningfully address the state of London&apos;s air. They demanded safer streets for cyclists, pedestrian only areas in the city, and cleaner taxis and buses. &quot;We need a radical rethink about the way we run our cities. In Europe a lot of countries have a zero-tolerance policy on cyclist deaths. Last year we had 16 and that is just unconscionable,&quot; Whitebread said. Many of the participants were not sure who they would vote for next week. But they did know who would not be receiving their vote. &quot;I&apos;ll be voting for anyone but Boris,&quot; said Damien Clarkson, a campaigner at Climate Rush.",

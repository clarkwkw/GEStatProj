    "text": "There&apos;s a growing view that if you attended a state school you&apos;ll be given an easy ride into a top university. Outraged by suggestions of positive discrimination in favour of less privileged students, one private school head has suggested schools boycott universities which adopt the practice. They reckon it&apos;s unfair: imagine trying to compete with people who have such a great advantage handed to them Some blame Alan Milburn, the government adviser for social mobility, for calling on top institutions to make lower offers to &quot;less-advantaged pupils&quot;, others look to the Office for Fair Access, Offa, which challenges universities to try to create a balanced student demographic. I am one of those state school students who swanned in with a lower than standard offer while my privately-educated peers slaved away to secure their place. On the University of Bristol&apos;s website it states: &quot;We may make lower offers based on whether an applicant is deemed to have experienced an educational disadvantage.&quot; The fact that I fell into this category, and therefore represent Bristol&apos;s attempt at an outreach policy, is simply insane. I may have attended a state school but I come from a very smug middle class town, I do not qualify for any bursaries, and I had a pony. Yet, arriving at the University of Bristol&apos;s arts faculty, where state school intake for the academic year 2012-13 stood at just 43.6%, I felt myself at a definite disadvantage. If I can be considered by some as under-privileged because I don&apos;t play polo and have a soft northern accent (&quot;Oh you&apos;re northern! That&apos;s fun!&quot; remarked a fellow the first time I opened my mouth in a seminar) then it&apos;s hard to imagine how someone from a truly modest background would feel here. It&apos;s a world where students hang pheasants on their washing lines and people are astonished to hear that you have never been hunting: &quot;Not even once?!&quot; Last year, state school applications made up just 56.5% of the total applications received by Bristol University. We have to ask ourselves why access to top universities is still so limited. In the academic year of 2011-12 Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, Bristol and St Andrews all admitted a student population consisting of less than 60% state school students. This is astounding when you think that privately educated students account for just 7% of the student population in the UK. Those who cry discrimination in the face of these attempts to make a place at a top university possible for bright but less privileged students do not understand how much of a headstart a private education provides. In October 2012, the Telegraph published research showing that 30.6% of pupils from private schools achieved three As at A-level, the same figure stood at just 10.7% for state school pupils. It&apos;s not a difference in intellectual ability that produces statistics like these. Earlier this year Anna Vignoles, professor of education at the University of Cambridge, told the Telegraph: &quot;Private schools are very effective at getting good grades for people whose ability is a bit lower, whose degree performance is not as good as people (from state schools) with the same grades. Admissions officers will take this into account when making offers.&quot; One aspect where the gap in opportunity between state school and privately educated students is particularly apparent is the personal statement. A spokesperson from the Sutton Trust tells me: &quot;Both the quality of presentation and the content (particularly of non-academic matter) of these statements differs starkly.&quot; In 2012, despite having the same grades, 70% of applications from privately educated students were successful in gaining the student a place at a top university in comparison to just 50% of the applications from state schools. The Sutton Trust is now calling on universities to take &quot;young people&apos;s background into account, and judge low and middle income applicants according to the academic and extracurricular opportunities available to them.&quot; We are a long way off equality of educational opportunities. Although I would love to see what a &quot;boycott&quot; of certain universities by private schools would constitute, I don&apos;t think they need to worry themselves just yet. We are still some way off levelling the playing field.",

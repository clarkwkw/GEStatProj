    "text": "   Vodafone and O2: sharing 18,500 masts. Photograph: PA    Vodafone and O2 are clubbing together to speed up the roll-out of superfast 4G mobile broadband to virtually everyone. The nation&apos;s second- and third-biggest mobile operators say they will pool their network of radio masts and antennas to enable them to cover 98% of the population by 2015. Combined, the companies will share a network of 18,500 masts which, they promise, will extend current 2G and 3G coverage to all but the most remote villages. They will also kit out the masts with 4G technology so they can offer mobile internet speeds fast enough to download and stream TV and music as soon as the government approves the sales of 4G licences. The deal follows the merger of Orange and T-Mobile UK to create the nation&apos;s biggest network, run by a new joint venture company called Everything Everywhere. Vodafone and O2&apos;s deal is not a full-blown merger and the companies will continue to operate different airwaves. Three, the nation&apos;s smallest operator, piggybacks on Everything Everywhere&apos;s network. Guy Laurence, chief executive of Vodafone UK, said: &quot;This will create two stronger players who will compete with each other and with other operators to bring the benefits of mobile internet services to consumers and businesses across the country. This partnership will improve the service that customers receive today and give Britain the 4G networks that it will need tomorrow.&quot; Ronan Dunne, chief executive of O2, which is owned by Spanish telecoms giant Telefnica, said: &quot;Exceptional customer demand for the mobile internet has challenged the mobile industry to consider innovative solutions. This partnership is about working smarter as an industry.&quot; Matthew Howett, lead telecom analyst at Ovum, said the operators are being forced to explore network-sharing deals to save money as consumers reined in spending. &quot;In the face of continued downward pressure on revenues (coming from cuts in mobile termination rates and international roaming in Europe), operators are understandably looking to reduce costs where possible,&quot; he said. &quot;The sharing of network infrastructure is now a common practice and it&apos;s pragmatic that these two operators should do the same.&quot; But he warned that the roll-out of 4G services was still dependent on mobile operators resolving their bickering about the much-delayed government auction of 4G spectrum. &quot;Unless swift action is taken, the UK could risk being one of the last countries in Europe to get 4G services,&quot; Howett said. 4G services are already up and running in Lithuania and most of Scandinavia, and even Angola is scheduled to get 4G before the UK. Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, has pledged that Britain will have the best superfast broadband in Europe by 2015. As part of the deal about 2,500 overlapping masts will be removed from towns, cities and the countryside. The companies said the agreement would not lead to any job losses.",

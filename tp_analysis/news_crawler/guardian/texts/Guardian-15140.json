    "headline": "There is no alternative!", 
    "text": "The late Margaret &quot;Tina&quot; Thatcher claimed that &quot;there is no alternative&quot; to economic liberalism, and our own iron Frau Angela Merkel has defended her controversial fiscal policies for Europe with the very same slogan. It is not surprising that politicians use such thought-terminating cliches to push through their agenda, but remarkably the &quot;there is no alternative&quot; argument also plays a vital role in science. For example, it has been argued that string theory must be the way to unify quantum physics and gravity because we have not found any alternative. While this seems to merely reflect our incompetence, scientific philosophers have now proven mathematically that the &quot;no alternative&quot; argument can indeed provide evidence for a scientific hypothesis. So how does such a philosophic proof work, and what is &quot;scientific philosophy&quot; anyway?  While most scientists do not care much about the philosophy of science, almost everyone knows of Karl Popper, and some might have heard of Thomas Kuhn. Both Popper and Kuhn have shaped two important phases of philosophy of science in the 20th century. Popper and his contemporaries were aiming at the grand picture, and have been arguing what is, and what is not, &quot;good science&quot;. Kuhn, on the other hand, focused on sociological and historical aspects and initiated a new, descriptive style of philosophy that brought it closer to the actual scientific practice. In his talk at the recent meeting of the German Society for Philosophy of Science, Stephan Hartmann, Director of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, argued that we have now entered a third phase, the phase of &quot;scientific philosophy&quot;. Scientific philosophy combines different scientific methods to address philosophical problems, including mathematics, empirical studies and even experiment. Hartmann (with his collaborators Richard Dawid (Wien) and Jan Sprenger (Tilburg)) demonstrated the power of such an approach by analyzing the &quot;no alternatives&quot; argument: can we base trust in a scientific theory on the fact that no alternative has been found? In a recent paper to appear in The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Hartmann and his collaborators Dawid and Sprenger provide a mathematical proof of the &quot;no alternatives&quot; argument based on Bayesian statistics.  Bayesian statistics owes its name to Reverend Thomas Bayes (c 1701-1761) and considers trust, or the degree of belief, as probability. Probabilities have very simple and intuitive properties: the probability of an event A, P(A), is between 0 (0% chance or A will not happen) and 1 (100% chance or A will happen), and the probability for two mutually exclusive events to happen, P (A or B), is equal to the sum P(A) + P(B). For example, the chance of getting a 1 or a 2 when throwing a dice is P(1 or 2) = P(1) + P(2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3. Bayesian statistics tells us how to update a degree of belief in light of new evidence, and it is cast into a very simple equation. Let P(A) be the probability for an event A to happen, and P(A|B) the probability that A happens provided B is true. Then Bayes&apos; rule says that     P(A|B) = P(A) x P(B|A) / P(B)   Imagine a major football tournament. England has made the semi-finals, and before the match you are pretty confident and think there is a 80% chance for them to go through to reach the final, P(A) = 0.8. Now, unfortunately, the semi-final ends in a goalless draw, so that England has to face penalties. Only 10% of the times England won an important match it has been on penalties, P(B|A) = 0.1, while 40% of the lost matches where lost after a penalty shootout, P(B|not A) = 0.4. Obviously, the chances that England will reach the final on penalties are much smaller than your initial estimate of 80%, but by how much? Applying Bayes&apos; rule, and rewriting P(B) using the probability law for two mutually exclusive events as P(B) = P(B |A) x P(A) + P(B |not A) x P(not A), we find   P(England wins on penalties) = P(A|B) = 0.8 x 0.1 / (0.1 x 0.8 + 0.4 x 0.2) = 0.5.  (I know, that is still unrealistically high, but it is just an example, and I wanted to avoid dealing with too small numbers...) In their Bayesian analysis of the &quot;no alternative&quot; argument, Hartmann and his collaborators proved that the failure to find an alternative indeed raises the probability for a scientific hypothesis to be correct:   P(Hypothesis A is true | no alternative has been found) &gt; P(Hypothesis A is true).   This statement holds under very general and plausible assumptions. It fails, however, if we are certain that the number of alternative theories is infinite. (But how could we be certain about that?) While I find the mathematical proof of the &quot;no alternative&quot; argument remarkable, a number of open issues still remain. By how much is our trust in a scientific theory boosted, given that we have not found an alternative? The answer depends on various parameters, including our beliefs on the number of alternatives, which is subjective and hard to quantify. Thus, as it stands, the &quot;no alternatives&quot; argument is rather qualitative than quantitative. And what do we consider an acceptable alternative? Again, the answer involves the judgement and preferences of individual scientists, and depends on sociological and historical factors, which may in some cases even preclude us from pursuing scientifically viable theories.  Despite these open issues and conceptual problems, the Bayesian analysis of the &quot;no alternative&quot; argument has provided a novel way to approach an important problem of the philosophy of science. So philosophers, get out of your armchairs and embrace mathematical, empirical and even experimental methods to address philosophical questions! There is no alternative.

    "text": "Top researchers with half an ear to the ground tend to know about openings in their field long before the advert is published. But this time, Ludmilla Jordanova, professor of modern history at King&apos;s College London, admits the approach from Durham University was &quot;a bolt from the blue&quot;. She told them she wasn&apos;t in the market for a job. But Durham, which has been on a mission to recruit 40 big-hitting academics, was persuasive. Next September, Jordanova will move nearly 300 miles to take up her new chair in history and visual culture at the university. Durham is not the only university out poaching big names. Leeds University is investing 23m in up to 50 new professorial posts; Manchester University has hired 120 stars; Surrey has a target of 75; the University of East Anglia brought in 100 new academics this year and 100 the year before. An element of musical chairs in academia is nothing new. But talk to university leadership teams and the advisers they are calling in to help them and it becomes clear that the stakes have risen. Recruiting the right talent has never been more important: and holding on to your own bright things has never been more crucial or more challenging. In part this fierce battle is being driven by the looming Research Excellence Framework, which will distribute somewhere in the region of a billion pounds of government research funding annually. One stellar academic can no longer singlehandedly change a department&apos;s fortunes, but research institutions have been filching researchers from each other for many months. Anyone in post by 31 October 2013 can be submitted as part of a university&apos;s research profile for the REF. But this is only part of the picture. Institutions see hiring big names as a way of shoring up their reputation and their finances in an increasingly uncertain world. Across the globe research funding is settling on ever fewer universities and increasingly any institution that wants to be part of the game needs some serious players. Durham&apos;s vice-chancellor, Prof Chris Higgins, says: &quot;It&apos;s really important to have the right talent on board. We aren&apos;t looking at this from an REF position  of course that&apos;s important, but it&apos;s just a snapshot. We are investing in the university in the long term.&quot; Like many research universities, Durham is spreading its net internationally. New appointments include Tuomas Eerola, a world-leading musicologist from Finland, and Georgios Theodoropoulos, a leading light at IBM in Dublin. But, of course, this is a two-way street. Higgins says: &quot;The chase for talent is hotting up because there is global competition. There are universities in the East investing heavily and often trying to hire back staff who have gone abroad. If we are going to compete we&apos;ve got to work even harder to obtain and retain talent.&quot; Nottingham University has invested considerably in the East, with campuses in China and Malaysia. UK-based staff are often attracted by the potential to spend time abroad, but Prof Christine Ennew, pro vice-chancellor at Nottingham, adds that the campuses also draw in academics who don&apos;t want to be in the UK. Having seen it at first-hand, Ennew is under no illusions about the increasing pulling power of the East. &quot;I think the UK will start to lose academic staff to countries such as China because of the funding opportunities. My feeling is that what we will see, at least to begin with, is parallel appointments with a growing number of leading researchers spending part of the year somewhere else in the world where they have a parallel  and probably better funded  lab.&quot; In this predatory environment many universities are trying to think more strategically. Matt Robb, of the consultancy Parthenon, says: &quot;We have done work for universities that want to know which universities rated lower than they are have good people who are ripe for poaching.&quot; And individual academics are waking up to their potential earning power. &quot;I&apos;ve had academics coming to me saying, &apos;I&apos;m ranked more highly than my university now  how do I monetise that?&apos;&quot; Alex Acland, higher education expert at the headhunting firm Heidrick and Struggles, agrees that the market can be ruthless. &quot;Modern universities with just a few peaks of international research excellence are the ones who suffer most, because it really matters if they lose their stars,&quot; he says. Many vice-chancellors have been hard at work trying to talk talented individuals out of leaving. Fatima Koumbarji, of the executive search firm Odgers Berndtson, explains: &quot;In a few roles we&apos;ve had recently we&apos;ve found institutions counter-offering. Usually it is a promotion, sometimes with financial benefits or a paid sabbatical.&quot; Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, says: &quot;You have to have an understanding of who the people are you absolutely don&apos;t want to lose and you need to know that long before they get approached by another institution and come to you wanting more money or a promotion.&quot; To stand a chance of deflecting a tempting offer from elsewhere, universities need to nurture their own talent and keep them sweet. &quot;Sometimes that just means leaving them alone to get on with their research,&quot; says Riordan. One piece of bait that research-intensive universities often use to woo big names is the promise of time off from teaching to concentrate on research. David Richardson, pro vice-chancellor for research at the University of East Anglia, says: &quot;A lot of researchers want to be sure that they will have the space to develop their new programme and not be overloaded with teaching in the first couple of years.&quot; No one escapes teaching completely, however. But Higgins says he takes a hard line with research egos at Durham. &quot;We don&apos;t have superstars who just do research and don&apos;t teach students,&quot; he says firmly. &quot;If they simply want to research they can go elsewhere.&quot; Jordanova says this proved a strong attraction  and she will be taking first-years from the start. &quot;I absolutely adore teaching,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t like it when people think the only thing that matters is research, or that they are too grand to teach.&quot; Mike Boxall, of PA Consulting, warns that the obsession with research talent may be a costly mistake for many institutions. &quot;Every university is clamouring to do the best it can out of the REF and research, but it is a game that most of them will lose,&quot; he says.

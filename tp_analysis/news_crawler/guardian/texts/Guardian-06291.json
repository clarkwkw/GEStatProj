    "text": "Thinking of attending the excellent Develop Conference in Brighton next Tuesday? If so, we have the perfect warm-up event for you. On Monday 9 July, Gamesblog is hosting its annual video game quiz at the Caroline of Brunswick pub.  Teams of between four and five players are welcome to attend, and you&apos;ll be answering questions on the history of games and current industry affairs, as well as identifying screenshots and audio clips. This year, I&apos;ll be co-hosting the evening with my friends from digital gaming site, Hookshot, so you&apos;ll get to meet legendary games writers Simon Parkin, Christian Donlan and Will Porter. It&apos;s also a great chance to network with local games developers  who have, historically, fared pretty badly at the quiz. The evening starts at 8pm and you don&apos;t need to be signed up for Develop to attend  it&apos;s open to all.  If you&apos;re interested in coming along and submitting a team, please do let me know at keith dot stuart at guardian dot co dot uk, or send me a Tweet at @keefstuart.  See you there!",

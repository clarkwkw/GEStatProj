    "text": "Many teachers say that they feel demoralised and overworked, and face constant criticism and unrealistic expectations, a survey suggests. A YouGov poll of 852 teachers commissioned by the National Union of Teachers found that 42% of respondents rated their morale as low or very low, with 59% feeling it had declined in the past two years; only 27% described their morale as high. The most rewarding aspect of the job, say 92%, is being in the classroom with pupils and seeing them progress. Their biggest obstacle is seen as the constantly changing policy initiative, cited by 63%, followed by large amounts of unnecessary paperwork, 62%, constant external criticism of teachers, 58%, and unrealistic expectations of what they can achieve within a working week, 53%. The deciding factor if they were to leave the profession would be the excessive workload for 71%, followed by changes to pay and pensions, 56%. Christine Blower, the NUT general secretary, said that recruiting teachers could be an uphill struggle unless the government started to listen. &quot;While teaching is certainly one of the best possible professions, this survey illustrates how it is also now one of the hardest. &quot;Teachers should not be in a position where constant criticism and undermining of their job leaves them so demoralised. The rewards of classroom teaching are immense but increasingly teachers will balance this against the struggle of dealing with every changing initiatives, an excessive workload, unfair inspection systems, and worsening pay and pensions.&quot;  ",

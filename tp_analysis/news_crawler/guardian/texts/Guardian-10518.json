    "text": "You may only just have worked out how to use your set top box after the digital switchover, but there is bad news for the nation&apos;s TV lovers on the horizon  it will soon be time to adjust your television sets again. It took five years of wall-to-wall advertising and engineer visits to complete the digital switchover, which saw flatscreen digital televisions replace bulky cathode ray sets. Now the telecoms watchdog is warning viewers of more disruption. Mobile networks want a larger chunk of airwaves to connect phones to the internet, and television services on Freeview, BT and TalkTalk will have to move over to make room. Set top boxes will need to be retuned, some rooftop aerials will need replacing and filters may need to be fitted to homes near masts to prevent mobile interference. Regulators said they would work to minimise the disruption, but the advent of the smartphone is ramping up the amount of data consumed over the airwaves, and there are fears of a &quot;capacity crunch&quot;. With smartphone owners now using the small screen to shop, socialise, email and even watch television, mobile networks are pumping out 20m gigabytes of data a month, the equivalent of 5bn music tracks. The auction of 4G spectrum for superfast mobile internet will not be held until January, but planning is already under way for 5G services to cope with ballooning traffic. &quot;Within the coming months we will hold the UK&apos;s largest ever auction of mobile spectrum for 4G. However that may not be enough to meet consumers&apos; future data demands, which is why we are already making significant efforts to prepare to go beyond 4G,&quot; said the Ofcom chief executive, Ed Richards. &quot;Our plans are designed to avoid a capacity crunch.&quot; In the hunt for more spectrum, technicians have set their sights on the airspace occupied by television. The changes are unlikely before 2018, but will represent a third wave of disruption for the country&apos;s 20m Freeview homes. First there was digital switchover, when the signals sent from masts to aerials were changed, requiring every home to install a set top box if they had not already bought a new digital television. The process ended in October, but is about to start again. Over the coming months, to make way for 4G services, digital TV is being squeezed out of the airspace it currently occupies. Before that switch even takes place, Ofcom is saying the signal will have to move again in six years&apos; time. Spectrum is divided into bands, and mobile is occupying an increasing number of them. Television sits in the 800 megahertz band, and by the end of next year will have been moved to the 700MHz band. Up to 180m is being set aside from the proceeds of the mobile auction to help 900,000 homes near masts that could be affected. Filters will need to be fitted, in some cases on to rooftop aerials by engineers. In a process which one industry watcher described as &quot;mindboggling&quot;, the announcement means the switch will need to be repeated a third time, with television possibly moving into the 600MHz band. The Freeview chair, Charles Constable, said television had become the poor relation to mobile. &quot;Ofcom has yet to make the case to justify today&apos;s proposed long-term changes to allocate more future spectrum to mobile use, especially given the disruption they will cause to Freeview viewers.&quot; Mobile spectrum auctions raise billions. The 3G sale in 2000 saw operators hand over 22.4bn to the Treasury, and January&apos;s 4G sale could bring in up to 4bn. Questions are increasingly being asked about whether television will remain airborne. A House of Lords report has suggested the nation start planning for a day when all channels, including the BBC, are broadcast only via the internet. Ofcom vowed to &quot;seek to ensure the long-term future of digital terrestrial TV&quot;, saying it provided low cost, universal access to public service channels.",

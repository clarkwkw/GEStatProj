    "text": "The panel share their thoughts on the big issues of 2012, discuss what&apos;s ahead in 2013, and answer readers&apos; questions from our talk point.  Exciting times for Africa, the first drop in aid for decades and community mobilisation in response to the global rush for resources were key topics for the Global development team. In the studio debate, chaired by John Vidal, the Guardian&apos;s environment editor, Liz Ford, deputy editor of Guardian Global development, talked about refocusing aid and concerns over a lack of jobs in many parts of the developing world.  The studio panel discussed what should be included in the set of targets to replace the millennium development goals (MDGs), which will be decided in 2013. Despite fears that the important decisions have already been made, Jamie Drummond, executive director at the advocacy group ONE, was hopeful of more civic engagement and a renewed drive to meet the MDGs. On the line from Johannesburg, Mandeep Tiwana, a specialist in advocacy and civil society freedoms at Civicus, warned of one-sided indicators in the MDGs, and said economic growth and progress towards meeting the goals has sometimes come in repressed societies. Economic professor Jayati Ghosh, on the line from Jawaharlal Nehru University in India, argued that the MDGs are too focused on outcomes rather than ways to achieve change. She urged merging the sustainability and development agendas but warned that the world is going in the wrong direction on hunger and employment.  The panellists shared strong opinions of the G8 summit to be held in June, questioning whether we need another conference on hunger and expressing concern over the G8&apos;s focus on big business.",

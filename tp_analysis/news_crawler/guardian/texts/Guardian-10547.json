    "text": "December sees Jupiter, the largest planet, at opposition in Taurus just as the smallest planet, Mercury, is easy to spot before dawn and also at its best for the year. Add a superb display of Geminids meteors, and the starscapes around Orion illuminating our midnight sky, and we have a great month for starwatchers. Jupiter, 609 million km away and conspicuous at mag -2.8, lies opposite the Sun on the 3rd so that it rises in the NE at sunset, passes high in the S at midnight and is sinking in the NW before dawn. Edging eastwards to the N of Aldebaran, its cloud-banded disc appears 48 arcsec wide through any telescope. Catch it alongside the Moon on the evening of Christmas Day. Mars, mag 1.2, hovers low in the SW after sunset and lies 7 below the young Moon on the 15th. Our predawn sky, though, is bursting with interest. Pre-eminent is the dazzling (mag -4.0 to -3.9) Venus which rises in the ESE at about 05:20 GMT on the 1st but only 95 minutes before the Sun on the 31st. Saturn, much fainter at mag 0.6, stands 5 above-right of Venus on the 1st and climbs away to lie 39 from Venus on the 31st. By then, Saturn rises by 03:10, has crossed from Virgo into Libra and is 16 left of Spica in the S before dawn. Venus serves as an ideal pointer to Mercury which lies below and to Venus&apos;s left. At mag -0.3 to -0.6, Mercury is much the fainter as it closes to within 6.3 of Venus on the 9th before falling away to 11, and disappearing into the twilight, by the year&apos;s end. Bright and slow meteors of the Geminids shower diverge from a point above Castor in Gemini from the 7th to 16th, being most prolific on the nights of the 12th and 13th. Expect more details here on the 10th.

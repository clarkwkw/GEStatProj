    "text": "In his letter in the Money Guardian section (Your shout, 25 August) regarding student loans, Michael Meadowcroft writes: &quot;No undergraduate has to pay anything upfront, no interest is charged and there are no repayments until he or she is earning 420 per week.&quot; Newspaper articles on the new student loans scheme regularly omit to explain or lack clarity in explaining the interest on the student loans for fees. The information from Directgov on student loans for fees explains: &quot;You&apos;re charged interest on your loan from the time you get your first payment in university until you pay your loan back in full. The amount of interest you&apos;re charged varies (see table). The actual interest rates depend on the rate of inflation.&quot; A table then shows that while you are studying, the interest rate on your loan is the rate of inflation plus 3%; if later you earn 21,000 or less, the rate will be the rate of inflation; if you earn 21,000-41,000, the rate varies between the rate of inflation and the rate of inflation plus 3%, depending on your income; if you earn 41,000 or more, the interest will be the rate of inflation plus 3%.Hilary ClinchMilton Keynes  Michael Meadowcroft (Letters, 15 August) castigates student advisers for misrepresenting the &quot;good deal for students&quot;. He states that they will pay &quot;no interest on the fees&quot;. He should first verify the facts from the government website. The general rate of RPI inflation plus 3%, at the current RPI, implies a doubling of the amount owing every nine years. A pretty bad deal, I would say!Philip BrownWaltham, Kent",

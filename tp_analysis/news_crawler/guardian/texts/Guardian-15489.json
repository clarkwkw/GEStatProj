    "text": "Concern and confusion over the decision to ban non-African diplomatic delegations and all non-affiliated NGOs dampened celebrations at this year&apos;s African Union (AU) summit, which marked the 50th anniversary of its predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity. &quot;As civil society we are concerned with the shrinking space especially around this conference which will be setting the agenda for Africa for the next 50 years,&quot; said Jamillah Mwanjisi, co-ordinator of the State of the Union, a coalition of African NGOs. At the summit, which ended on Monday, African leaders discussed Vision 2063  a blueprint for the continent&apos;s development over the next half-century. The foreign diplomatic community, many of whose governments provide financial and other support to the AU, were also unhappy about being banned from the premises. AU summits usually provide an opportunity for bilateral meetings between the continent&apos;s leaders and officials from non-African states. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chair of the AU commission, said the decision to exclude some civil society organisations and other non-AU delegations was in direct response to these fringe meetings, which are felt to distract leaders and ministers from the summit agenda. &quot;Closed sessions are closed sessions. We decide which ones are closed  we decide which sessions are open. And if you are not going to be participating in the discussion why do you want to be here?&quot; Dlamini-Zuma said. &quot;We have to be allowed to do our work in an efficient way,&quot; she added, citing the EU, which doesn&apos;t allow any observers at its meetings. However, Anton du Plessis, deputy executive director of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) thinktank, said the EU is not analogous as the European body&apos;s foreign partners do not fund 97% of its programme budget  as is the case with the AU. There was some sympathy for the AU within the diplomatic community in Addis but a blanket ban at short notice  partners and civil society organisations were told only one week before the summit opened  is considered to have been an extreme response. The application of the ban was inconsistent and there was confusion about who was allowed into the AU compound and when. On Thursday, observers from foreign embassies and non-affiliated NGOs were initially allowed into the building only to be ejected by security guards. At the summit&apos;s final session on Monday, which was supposed to be closed, some observers were allowed to enter. &quot;It&apos;s confusing to say the least,&quot; said one foreign diplomat. &quot;Changing the gameplan while the action is unfolding is not very helpful.&quot; The message that the AU&apos;s external partners were not allowed access did not reach the organisation&apos;s member states, who approached foreign diplomatic missions to arrange bilateral meetings. The almost total absence of foreign delegates and non-AU affiliated NGOs seemed to have had a negative impact on the atmosphere at the summit, which was described by participants as &quot;flat&quot;. The vibrancy and exuberance expected at the 50th anniversary celebrations was sorely missing. Solomon Dersso, senior researcher at the ISS, said the absence of non-AU observers may have concentrated delegates&apos; minds. &quot;The assembly discussions looked very focused and they seem to have made some very interesting decisions,&quot; he said. African diplomats agreed, saying they were better able to apply themselves to their work. Indeed, African leaders made some bold, controversial and overdue decisions, including the establishment of a rapid deployment force, a call for the cases against President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto at the international criminal court (ICC) to be returned to Kenyan jurisdiction, and the long-awaited adoption of a report on alternative and additional methods of financing to reduce the AU&apos;s dependency on donor funding. Access will return to &quot;normal&quot; for the next AU summit, in January, although ambassador Baso Sangqu, chief adviser to Dlamini-Zuma, said the July 2014 meeting  and subsequent July gatherings  will be closed.",

Question: This lovely southeast Asian mystery bird is a distant relative of another mystery bird that I shared earlier this week. Which bird is that? Can you name this mystery birds taxonomic family and species? 
Response: This is an adult black-and-red broadbill, Cymbirhynchus macrorhynchos, which is placed into the broadbill family, Eurylaimidae. The broadbills apparently originated in southeast Asia, although two genera are found in sub-Saharan Africa. All broadbills are small passerines, and consume a wide variety of insects and spiders as well as lizards and tree frogs. Many species also consume small fishes and a variety of invertebrates, especially mollusks and crabs. 
The colourful bill is exceptionally large amongst its family members and the turquoise upper mandible and golden lower mandible are distinctive. The black-and-red broadbill has no close relatives and it is the only species placed into the genus, Cymbirhynchus. This widespread species is always found near water in subtropical and tropical lowland mangroves and rainforests throughout much of southeast Asia. These birds are residential territory holding birds that live in pairs or small (family?) groups. They build their nest in dead tree stumps near flowing water during the dry season. Males help incubate and tending to the chicks.  
In addition to the distinctively coloured and sized bill, black-and-red broadbills have glossy black upperparts and tail, a crimson rump and a bold but narrow white stripe on its otherwise black wings. The underparts and throat are brilliant crimson. Irides and legs are dark. Sexes are alike.

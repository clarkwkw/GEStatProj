    "text": "The exhortation to &quot;Keep Watching The Skies!&quot; dates from the 1951 science fiction film &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; but it is a task that astronomers have now taken to heart. Rather than UFOs, though, their quarry has been NEOs, or Near Earth Objects, and specifically the subset of NEOs that are PHOs, or Potentially Hazardous Objects, because of the dire consequences if one were to collide with our planet. They may include the odd comet, but the overwhelming majority of NEOs and PHOs are asteroids so that the terms NEA and PHA are often used instead. To be an NEO, the object&apos;s orbit must carry it within 45 million km of the Earth&apos;s orbit but to be a PHO this potential miss-distance needs to be under 7.5 million km and it must appear to be larger than about 150 metres in diameter. Of the 9,500 known NEOs, 1,360 are PHOs and 154 of these may be more than 1km across and approaching the size of body that is thought to have put paid to the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. None of the latter is predicted to be on a collision course, and there may be only 25 or so left to be discovered. Observations earlier this month have effectively ruled out any danger that the 250km-plus asteroid Apophis might collide with the Earth in 2036. Meanwhile, the 45-metre body 2012 DA14 is due to skim within 28,000km of the Earth&apos;s surface, and inside the orbital distance of geosynchronous satellites, on the 15th of next month.",

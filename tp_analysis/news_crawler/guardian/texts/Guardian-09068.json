    "text": "I have enrolled on a medical course at university and I am having trouble choosing a Windows 7 laptop. I would preferably like one that is: lightweight and so easy to carry, durable, and fashionable, with the latest technology and specification to handle multimedia, graphics, Adobe software etc. Money is not a concern. What are your opinions on the Sony S and E series (i5), and could you recommend one for me please?Esther By far the largest proportion of the Windows laptop market is for economy-priced machines, which usually cost less than 500. However, most of the larger suppliers have at least one well constructed high-end design, and in private, may even refer to it as a &quot;hero product&quot;. Today, this should have a third generation Intel Core iX chip, code-named Ivy Bridge, and it may well have a dedicated graphics chip, to supplement the Intel HD 4000 graphics probably built into the processor. Several of these systems also include built in 3G connections as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The &quot;hero product&quot; will often have a 1600 x 900 screen display instead of the usual 1366 x 768 pixels. Opting for this on anything smaller than a 17in screen will eliminate the vast majority of Windows laptops and almost guarantees a better quality machine. It also means that text looks smaller. Look at this resolution in a shop: it is not to everyone&apos;s taste. At the moment, the Sony S Series 13P probably fills the hero niche (the P stands for Premium) previously occupied by the &quot;ultimate&quot; Vaio Z. By comparison, the E Series uses plastic construction and competes in the economy market (&quot;Stand-out style and everyday essentials for work and play,&quot; says Sony) at 400 to 500. The major difference between the Sony S Series 13 and the 13P is that the S has the base-level 13.3in widescreen with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The 13P has a Premium Display with a resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels.  The Sony S Series 13 is the one you are most likely to see in a shop. It is usually white, but is also available in black and silver versions for an extra 20. The S Series 13P model comes in either carbon black or a gun-metal finish. Sony also sells a silver S Series 15 with a 15.5in Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixel) screen. All three are available from the Sony UK website. The main advantage of buying direct is that you can configure your own laptop, with a choice of processor, memory, hard drive, optical drive, operating system and additional software. Also, you know you will get the latest version. Sony has been making S Series laptops for a few years and doesn&apos;t change the name when it updates the specification. The standard black S Series 13P (code SVS13A1C5E in the UK; SVS13A190X in the USA) starts at 1,020. However, you can upgrade from a 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-3210M to a 2.9GHz Core i7-3520M for an extra 50, and upgrade the slot-loading DVD player to Blu-ray for an extra 40. These are bargain prices. Upgrading from 4GB of memory to 8GB costs 100, which isn&apos;t, but you could increase it to 6GB for 50 or fit your own extra RAM. The 13P&apos;s Nvidia GeForce GT 640M LE graphics comes with 1GB of memory as standard, and upgrading to 2GB costs an extra 30. This would be useful for handling graphics, including your Adobe software and any high-end games. But for most computing purposes, such as word processing and web browsing, the dedicated graphics will usually be turned off to save battery power. An upgraded 13P with a backlit keyboard, Core i7 processor, 6GB of main memory, 2GB of video memory, 500GB hard drive, Blu-ray, three USB ports and two-year warranty comes out at 1,241.While this is expensive for a Windows laptop, it&apos;s the same as a 13.3in MacBook Pro with a similar spec (1,249). The MacBook Pro has a bigger hard drive (750GB), but the Sony 13P has dedicated graphics, and Apple doesn&apos;t offer you Blu-ray or 3G. Whether you need these is another matter. The Sony S Series 13P is a high-end ultraportable, and would typically compete with other ultraportable business laptops such as the Lenovo ThinkPad X range and Toshiba&apos;s Portg machines. However, the market has shifted over the past couple of years, following the success of Apple&apos;s MacBook Air. Most PC companies now offer similar Windows laptops following Intel&apos;s Ultrabook specification. This requires, among other things, a thin body and fast start-up and resume times. The MacBook Air and Ultrabooks are today&apos;s fashion, but manufacturers make some sacrifices to create thinner laptops. These include dropping the optical drive (which ultraportable ThinkPads did last century), restricting the number of ports, sealing in the battery, and replacing the hard drive with Flash memory chips. These SSDs (solid state drives) provide much snappier performance, especially since you never have to wait for hard drive platters to spin up to speed. The disadvantages are that SSDs are expensive and tend to be rather small, eg 128GB or 256GB. Sony&apos;s Ultrabook is the Vaio T Series, which is similar to the S Series but better value. Prices start at 649 for the model with an 11.6in screen and 679 for the 13.3in version. Upgrading a T13 to a 1.7GHz Core i5-3317U processor, 8GB of memory and 128GB SSD will set you back 819. Compared with the 13P, you lose processor speed, the dedicated Nvidia graphics, keyboard backlighting and the DVD or Blu-ray drive, but gain in SSD speed and battery life. Weight is about the same. Several other Ultrabooks are also worth considering. The leading examples are the new Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, Toshiba Portg Z903, Samsung Series 9 and Asus Zenbook UX32A. All of these have the latest Intel Core i5-3317U (Ivy Bridge) processor or better. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon and Samsung Series 9 have the edge in showing 1600 x 900 pixels, whereas the Asus and Toshiba models only do the usual 1366 x 768. However, the X1 Carbon comes at a price, with the cheapest version costing 1,039.99 if bought direct. The Toshiba Portg Z930-11G costs even more. By contrast, you could get a shiny Asus UX32A for 695.92 at Amazon.co.uk, reduced from 849.99, or a chic Samsung Series 9 (NP900X3C-A02UK) for 922.09, reduced from 1,199.  Asus also has a high-end Zenbook, the UX32VD, with a Full HD (1920 x 1080) screen, Nvidia GeForce GT 620M dedicated graphics and a somewhat better keyboard. This has not (as far as I know) been announced in the UK, so any you see will be imported. Either way, text will be rather small with so many pixels on screen, even with Windows 7&apos;s magnification set to 125%. After that, it&apos;s down to whether you like the screen and keyboard, what your main uses will be, and personal choice. If you will be carrying the machine around and stopping and starting it regularly, you would benefit from the longer battery life and fast resume times of an Ultrabook. If you will be using it more at home, or with heavyweight software, then you will benefit from the extra power and graphics of an ultraportable such as the Sony Series S 13P or Vaio Z.  You might even want to step up from a 13.3in or 14in (X1 Carbon) screen to a 15.6in laptop, though this would mean carrying a bigger and heavier machine. If so, judging by reviews, a Samsung such as the Series 9 (900X4C) could be a better buy than the Sony S Series 15.  In general, I like the Sony hardware, but the company has a reputation for loading its laptops with unwanted software. It&apos;s not always easy to remove programs you don&apos;t want, and it comes back if you need to re-set the laptop to factory condition using the recovery partition on the hard drive.  Of course, Sony is not the only Windows supplier to do this to its consumer laptops. Business machines such as Lenovo ThinkPads, Toshiba Portgs and Dell Vostros usually ship with much less bloatware. They also tend to be designed for greater durability rather than the lowest price. When it comes to fashionability, the Sony and ThinkPad brands stand out from the general morass of Windows laptops, with the ThinkPad being the leading business brand over the past 20 years. But neither of these is quite at the pinnacles of yesteryear, following Sony&apos;s long-term financial problems and the sale of IBM&apos;s PC division (which developed the ThinkPad) to China&apos;s Lenovo in 2005. The companies that are increasing their brand value are South Korea&apos;s Samsung and Taiwan&apos;s Asus. These are becoming prestige brands in parts of Asia, though perhaps not yet in the west. The Sony S Series 13P and ThinkPad X1 Carbon have the most cachet, but the Samsung Series 9 and Asus Zenbook may be better value for money at discounted prices.",

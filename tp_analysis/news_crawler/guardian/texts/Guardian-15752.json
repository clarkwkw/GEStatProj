    "text": "The legendary &quot;first bird&quot; Archaeopteryx was first described in 1861. Replete with fully feathered wings, it was not a surprise that a consensus was rapidly reached that this was an ancestral bird. After all, only birds had feathers. It didn&apos;t take long for people to suspect that Archaeopteryx may have had strong links to dinosaurs, but even though more and more Archaeopteryx-like dinosaurs were being found, and the idea that birds were dinosaurs gained huge ground in the latter part of the 20th century, few speculated that dinosaurs may have had feathers. Admittedly this was little discussed, but it seemed to be implicit that feathers were an avian trait and so must have appeared in conjunction with other things that allowed birds to fly. Birds might well have been dinosaurs, but that didn&apos;t mean any dinosaurs aside from birds had feathers. Eventually of course, this idea diminished and died. Partly because it required that feathers spring up evolutionary speaking at just the right moment in bird evolution, which seemed frankly implausible, and mostly because feathered non-avian dinosaurs started turning up. The first of these was Sinosauropteryx, which was only described in 1996  feathered dinosaurs basal to birds are a pretty recent phenomenon.  Since then, a huge wealth of finds means we are now well into double digits when it comes to species of dinosaurs that we can definitively say had feathers (off the top of my head there are Dilong, Yutyrannus, Sinocalliopteryx, Sciurumimus, Juravenator, Shuvuuia, Ornithomimus, Beipiaosaurus, Jianchangosaurus, Protarchaeopteryx, Caudipteryx, Similicaudipteryx, Microraptor (three species), Sinornithosaurus, Anchiornis, Jinfengopteryx, Xiaotingia, and Epidexipteryx. I&apos;m sure there are a few more I&apos;ve missed too). We can add a few more to that thanks to those animals that preserve &quot;quill knobs&quot;, bumps of bone on the arms that mark where feathers attach to the bone, so we can be confident feathers were present, even when not preserved (Velociraptor is the best example of this). This is really quite a lot  there might be well over a thousand dinosaur species, but given how rarely any soft tissues are preserved, to have even a couple of species preserved with feathers is pretty amazing. Not only that, but we also have tons of birds known with feathers too. It&apos;s understandable that a lot is talked about the origin of birds and the run-up to dinosaurs evolving the ability to fly. However, the stories often stop there and little attention is paid to the huge number of birds that lived alongside the dinosaurs and continued to evolve. Dozens more bird species are known with feathers and that shows that (unsurprisingly) the origin of flight was just the start and further diversification and evolution occurred with various lineages springing up and changing over time. The transition point from non-avian to avian is pretty well understood, but it&apos;s not just that single point that is of interest, and we have a great deal of information about the long run-up to that point and what happened for millions of years afterwards. Transitions abound. There&apos;s a wealth of data on morphological changes in this series, with tails shortening, teeth and claws reducing, beaks being produced, the gripping toe of the foot reversing, the pelvis changing shape and getting larger, and the change in shape of the shoulder and so on. However, here I want to focus on the actual feathers themselves  they are rarely preserved and so are the most interesting of the available data. The main thing is the generalised progression of the size and types of feathers present on the various lineages of dinosaurs. Modern flight feathers are really quite a complex structure  they have the central vane, and various branches and sub-branches that hook together and &quot;zip up&quot; to provide a relatively strong surface that can provide lift and resist the stresses of flight. These didn&apos;t pop into existence, but evolved gradually from more simple feathers. We tend to think these days of feathers as being like those of the wings or tail of birds such as pigeons, but a quick look round reveals quite a diversity of feather types  body feathers that are short and wide, the fluffy down of chicks, long and thin filaments that cover kiwis or the necks of ostriches, stiff fibers that act as eyelashes for many birds, and of course a plethora of display feathers like those on peacocks or birds of paradise.  We see such diversity in dinosaurs too, though more intriguingly they form a fairly consistent pattern of change. The earliest feathers seem to be short and flexible filaments, rather like large hairs. Later on they get larger, then the vane appears, they get broader as sub branches develop and eventually we reach something like a modern feather. This actually appears in lineages that separate before, or in conjunction with, the origin of birds, so while feathers were around well before birds took to the air, flight feathers also seem to precede the birds as well (or at least those that could function as flight feathers). Also similar to what we see in modern birds, we see juvenile dinosaurs having feathers different to those of the adults. Just as chicks have relatively simple and fluffy down-like feathers, at least one dinosaur species is known where both juveniles and adults are both preserved with feathers, but the young have different feather types in different places on the body. As they grew they clearly moulted and changed from a juvenile to adult plumage. Intriguingly, there are also some non-avian dinosaurs with feathers not seen in any living birds. There was some apparent evolutionary experimentation going on and some feather types came and went. A medium-sized herbivorous dinosaur called Beipiaosaurus apparently had feathers that were long, stiff and quite solid. These ran in particular as a crest along the spine and were especially long and thick over the neck and back of the head. It&apos;s possible that these were a defensive structure, not too dissimilar to the spines of hedgehogs, porcupines, spiny mice and a number of other mammals that have done something similar with their hairs. The little Epidexipteryx (pictured above) also has odd feathers  it has four very long plumes attached to the tail that are thought to have been used as some kind of signal. However, although they superficially look like large &quot;normal&quot; feathers, their structure is unique. Despite their large size, they don&apos;t have a vane or any branches, but are instead simply a flat sheet, almost like a thin sheet of card has been cut to a rough feather shape. Quite what caused these oddities to appear and then vanish again is understandably not clear  perhaps they were unique to their lineages and died out with them, perhaps they later changed into other forms that were less expensive to produce  but clearly there was plenty of diversity of feathers in the Mesozoic. More and more feathered dinosaurs of all kinds continue to appear and now that we have an increasingly good idea of where to look for them, and importantly how to get them out of rocks intact, the rate of discovery is likely to accelerate. We already have a superb idea about the origin and evolution of feathers, and the clear progression from small and simple to large and complex as we move towards birds in the dinosaur family tree is a superb testament to just how much can be learned from relatively few pieces of information, and the way in which new finds fit into that pattern shows how strong those inferences are. The origin of birds was one of the great unknowns (or at least, most contested) for palaeontology, but this is now settled and supported to a remarkable degree. Without feathers, this would not be any less strong  the data from the bones are superb  but it shows how well everything matches and is a fantastic bonus.",

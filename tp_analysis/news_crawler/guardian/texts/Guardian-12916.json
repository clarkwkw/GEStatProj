    "text": "     Mark Ravenhill&apos;s new translation of Bertolt Brecht&apos;s play A Life of Galileo is currently playing at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford on Avon, with Ian McDiarmid in the title role.  What do Shakespeare and Galileo have in common? For a start they were both born in 1564. Science is so richly interwoven into the plays attributed to Shakespeare that many have argued that Francis Bacon is the true author. Earlier this month we were given the opportunity to compare these two extraordinary men at one of the RSC&apos;s Shakes Sphere talks, which are science-oriented panel discussions with audience participation. Shakespeare was friends with the British astronomer Thomas Digges, who believed the universe to be infinite and that the sun not the Earth was the centre of our solar system. Digges would have been aware of Galileo&apos;s research (and that of the Copernican astronomer Giordano Bruno) and may well have kept Shakespeare informed about the latest on Copernican philosophy. Digges&apos;s expertise was creatively used by Shakespeare and astronomical references and metaphors are integral to his dialogue, &quot;  and count myself a king of infinite space&quot; (Hamlet). Shakespeare may be referring to Galileo in Cymbeline (published in 1611) &quot;  O, learn&apos;d indeed were that astronomer that knew the stars as I his characters  &quot;. In the play&apos;s final scene, the god Jupiter descends to the stage surrounded by four angels, which could be interpreted as the planet and its four moons, which had been discovered by Galileo and were described in The Starry Messenger. (The Roman Inquisition imprisoned Galileo for refusing to deny Jupiter&apos;s satellites and Earth&apos;s orbit around the sun.) It could be argued that Galileo and Shakespeare have between them shaped modern Western culture more than any other Renaissance thinkers. Einstein described Galileo as the father of modern science; Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;wonderful knowledge of the human mind&quot; inspired Darwin (who dedicated the whole of the last chapter of The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals to Shakespeare); and the playright had a powerful influence on Freud (Freud&apos;s Oedipal reading of Hamlet is presented in The Interpretation of Dreams, for example). They had prescience in common but Shakespeare and Galileo were very different men, with very different ways of thinking, and they expressed their originality differently. I began wondering whether focusing on the differences between these two men might be a fruitful way to understand more about their continued influence. The RSC&apos;s Shakes Sphere talksare designed to explore Shakespeare&apos;s world, and the Science and Technology Facilities Council provides funding for research. It occurred to me that comparing fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans of the brain of an actor with those of an astronomer might yield some clues to Galileo and Shakespeare&apos;s drives. I enlisted the help of neurologist Professor Sophie Scott, who has a penchant for the brains of RSC actors. An expert on the evolution of speech, she has enticed many a famous thespian into her fMRI machine. RSC actor Ed Hughes and Royal Observatory Astronomer Marek Kukula agreed to take part in this experiment. Extracts from two contrasting texts  Galileo&apos;s The Starry Messenger and Mark Ravenhill&apos;s translation of Brecht&apos;s play  were used as tools to test the workings of the men&apos;s brains.The striking results from that experiment can be seen in the video above. The film was shown at the first of the Shakes Sphere talks held at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon on 9 February. Scott was on the panel and shared the results from the Hughes/Kukula experiment. When Scott questioned Hughes about what he thinks is happening when he cognitively embodies the dialogue, the actor spoke of wanting to keep &quot;each word whole&quot;. Also, an actor must be mindful of the whole, contextual meaning of the play. After all, the playwright has the bigger picture in mind. (Scott said she was so intrigued by Hughes&apos;s brain scan she has requested an encore for further imaging.) Professor Robin Dunbar of the University of Oxford was also at the Shakes Sphere talk and tried to explain why Shakespeare&apos;s mind was so exceptional: &quot;Understanding how dramatists are constrained by the audience&apos;s psychological capacity to follow the action helps us to see just how clever good dramatists actually are  and may even provide us with insights into the differences between the great and the merely good.&quot;     Levels of 'theory of mind' needed to follow  and write  the plot of Othello. Slide: Robin Dunbar    Dunbar&apos;s analysis of Shakespeare&apos;s plots suggests that the playwright belonged to a rare personality type. Fewer than one in five of us possesses a theory of mind enabling six, or possibly more, levels of social understanding regarding who knows what about whom  a crucial ability if you want to be a good writer of exciting fiction, fathom a social truth or be a convincing actor. This ability is clearly not essential for abstract, analytical observations of the heavens and construction of new technologies, such as telescopes. Dunbar&apos;s research helps to explain why Darwin considered Shakespeare&apos;s intuitive social understanding to be so wonderful. Kukula will attend the second Shakes Sphere event, which takes place at the Swan Theatre on Saturday. As someone who uses his white matter to research dark matter he will discuss what it was like having his brain studied and why being in an fMRI machine was, in his words, like &quot;being in an episode of Doctor Who&quot;. The alchemical quest for the Philosopher&apos;s Stone was a Renaissance obsession. Professor Andrea Sella, a chemist at University College London, knows that &quot;All that glisters is not gold&quot; and will join Kukula and use a mix of chemistry and magic upon the audience as he attempts the live transmutation of elements.  Shakespearean Dr Mareile Pfannebecker will contribute to the debate on what can happen when religion and politics attempt to control scientists and artists.  After four centuries of innovation, it seems new perspectives can still be taken on Shakespeare and Galileo&apos;s work. The second Shakes Sphere talk will take place at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon on Saturday 23 February at 11am  This article was amended on 22 February 2013. The original stated that Thomas Digges would have been aware of Galileo&apos;s book The Starry Messenger, but in fact he died before its publication. This has been corrected.",

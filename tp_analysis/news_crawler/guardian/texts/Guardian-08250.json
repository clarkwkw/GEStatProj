    "text": "The number of development studies courses offered by colleges and universities has grown over the last 20 years. The content of those courses has also changed to reflect new interests and trends in the sector, with topics covering a range of subjects, from economics and politics, to the environment, gender and anthropology. As the new academic year begins for some people this month, we would like to hear what is motivating you to study development. Has your interest been sparked by other studies, travel, or family connections? What are you hoping to get out of your course? Do you want to use it to influence politics, reform the World Bank, or help to carve out future sustainable development goals? We would like to hear your thoughts and motivations for study. Over the next few months, we will be building on our student resource section, adding more materials and articles we hope you&apos;ll find interesting. We currently have development data guides, a development calendar and a development-twitterati. We also have a list of recommended general first-year reads and a list of books focusing on sustainability and the environment. Over the next few weeks, we&apos;ll be adding lists of key reads on other topics, including gender and economics. But what content would you like to see? Or are there any essential resources you think we should link to? Post your thoughts below. If you have any problems posting, or if you would prefer to comment anonymously, email us at development@guardan.co.uk and we&apos;ll add your thoughts.",

    "text": "We entirely agree that &quot;more children and fewer nursery staff will threaten quality&quot; (Letters, 16 January), but reducing the cost of child care by allowing childminders to look after more and younger children at the same time is even more of a threat to quality of care, as most childminders work alone with nobody available to help if an ill baby needs carrying and three toddlers all have diarrhoea when it&apos;s tea time for two six-year-olds. Childminding is hard, devoted work. Changing the ratios will reduce not only the personal care and attachment available to each child, but also the hard-won professionalism of the service on which so many families rely.

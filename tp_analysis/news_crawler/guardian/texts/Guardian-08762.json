    "headline": "Migration Watch claims are an unjustified attack on overseas students", 
    "text": "Ever since the Labour government introduced biometric visas for non-EU visitors to the UK in 2008, it&apos;s fair to say foreign students have felt under constant attack. Coming to study at a UK university has become increasingly difficult, as would-be students get entangled in more complex and expensive visa requirements, face negative sentiment towards them in the British media, and experience increasingly stringent restrictions on their movements once they have arrived. In fact, the current coalition government has gone so far as to actively target foreign students by labelling them &apos;migrants&apos; and directly targeting them in support of its efforts to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands. I&apos;ve argued before (alongside many in the higher education sector) that international students should be classified as education tourists, not migrants. Prominent think tank the Migration Observatory has confirmed that only 6% of international students remain in the UK as students after five years  a period of time which may be dedicated to A-Levels and then a three year degree (without further post-graduate study). Lumping international education in with general immigration policy is a dangerous game to play. So the claim being made today by Migration Watch that non-EU students are being recruited to prop up the finances of less-well known universities is the latest attack in the unjustified war on foreign students. Not only are Migration Watch&apos;s arguments potentially damaging to the UK higher education sector, they are also misleading and inaccurate. Migration Watch, an organisation which monitors migration flows to and from the UK, claims that its finding that just 5% of the international students who enter Britain each year go to a top 10 university, and one in eight to a Russell Group university, is evidence that Britain is not attracting the brightest and the best of the international community. This data is questionable for a number of reasons. Firstly, the figures presented by Migration Watch are distorted by the fact that a significant number of international students do not go straight to university. Many come to feeder institutions where they take foundation programmes or complete their A-levels before progressing to higher education, often in top tier universities. If these students were removed from the calculation, and we looked only at the percentage of foreign students actually attending university in the UK, the proportion that go to top 10 or Russell Group institutions would be significantly higher. Secondly, the report fails to acknowledge that the best students do not necessarily go to the best universities. Many choose universities that might not be highly ranked but that have excellent specialist departments with notable alumni successes. Prominent examples include the University of the Creative Arts or the University of Lincoln, which has an excellent media department. The figures presented by Migration Watch will be further skewed by the fact that while business is the most popular subject choice for overseas students, many of the best business schools in the country are relatively new, and are not at top ranked universities. So we have excellent foreign students attending excellent business schools (such as Bristol Business School, part of the University of the West of England) who are branded as &quot;not the brightest and the best&quot; by Migration Watch. UK universities rely on international students for their intellectual, cultural and financial contribution. Universities such as London School of Economics, (with a 42% foreign student population) or Imperial College London (36%) have diversity ingrained in their culture and seek out the brightest minds from overseas to add to the prestige of their undergraduate courses and postgraduate research programmes. Without international students, these institutions would be financially and culturally worse off. The vast majority of international students do little more than arrive, learn and then leave. In the process they contribute significantly to the UK&apos;s higher education sector and the general economy  creating jobs in academia and the local community as well becoming the source of the UK&apos;s &apos;soft power&apos; on their return home. Yet our government, and organisations like Migration Watch, seem intent on driving them away. We still have the opportunity to promote our &apos;gold-standard&apos; universities and fill them with future leaders of industry from emerging economies all around the world. But let&apos;s not jeopardise our privilege to educate with a politically motivated debate on immigration which has nothing to do with these genuine and valuable education tourists.

    "text": "Two Cork-based trawler owners were charged with offences under the Irish Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act and Employment Permits Act at Cork district court on Wednesday. Leonard Hyde, 62, of Crosshaven, County Cork and Pat OMahony, 50, of Kinsale, County Cork, were accused of trafficking and illegally employing Filipino fisherman Demie Omol. The two men were charged with knowingly facilitating his entry in to Ireland on 23 March 2015 while knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that he was an illegal immigrant. They were additionally charged with employing a non-Irish national in the state without the legally required work permit.  No pleas were entered at this initial stage, as is the practice in Ireland. Hyde and OMahony, owners of the fishing vessel the Labardie Fisher, were remanded on bail and told by the judge, John King, to reappear before the court on 9 November.",

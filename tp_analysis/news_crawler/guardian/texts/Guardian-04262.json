    "text": "I agree with Simon Jenkins that &quot;British energy policy is a dark underworld of fanatics&quot; (Comment, 23 May) and I can&apos;t understand why the government is pushing for more investment in nuclear power when Fukushima is so recent. I&apos;ve also heard Ed Davey &quot;squirming&quot; on the BBC and saying we need investment to &quot;keep the lights on&quot;. Keep the lights on? Maybe 50 years ago this was the primary use of electricity but now most goes on powering masses of superfluous appliances and gadgets. So we should ask ourselves how we might distinguish between essential (keeping the lights on) and luxury (frothing coffee) electricity? One way would be to install a supplementary DC circuit in every home. Here batteries would be charged at cheap night-time rates or from solar panels, with them supplying a limited amount of essential electricity. The cost for daytime AC power could then be increased significantly so we all start to feel a real level of &quot;financial pain&quot; whenwe run the tumble-drier, switch on air-conditioning or leave the TV running when we are not really watching it.Alan MitchamCologne, Germany It ill behoves those of us who have lived long lives of profligate energy consumption to wring our hands as if nothing can be done to rationalise UK energy policy. 0ur best efforts make little impression on the global problem and may not impress India or China, but to do nothing sends a message about the greed of arrogant developed nations which they and others will seize with both hands. And we don&apos;t need to wait for Jenkins&apos;s wise mathematician to deliver answers. We should begin now by taking aggressive measures to cut energy use; not a glamorous step but effective, and cost-effective too.Phil BoothBristol  Simon Jenkins is right that energy policy can be confusing. Technologies hailed as the sustainable solutions to all of our energy problems often prove nothing of the sort. But his view of biomass as either a new dawn for energyor a technology that threatens halfthe world&apos;s forests is no longer true.The biomass power plant we have developed at Aston University overcomes many hurdles that have held backthis technology. By using residues and waste instead of energy crops, the plant does not require the destruction ofrainforests or agricultural land for palm oil production. In fact, its by-product  biochar  can be used to increase crop yields. And by using heat instead of incineration, it produces no emissions. In short, thereare no downsides. The first industrial-scale plant is working. If the government wants a clear conclusion for its energy policy, it need look nofurther.Tim MillerProject manager, European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University No public subsidy for nuclear power, says the energy secretary. Subsidies to the nuclear industry are illegal, according to EU regulations. So the government seeks to create a market structure which ensures the lights stay on. Consumers will have to pay for the infrastructure for new nuclear power stations, meaning prices will rise (Energy market shakeup raises fears of higher bills, 23 May). The insurance industry has become more reluctant to insure nuclear power stations after Fukushima, meaning we, the consumers, would have to pick up any bill in case of an accident. The issue of storing used nuclear material has also not been settled. Will the nuclear industry pay for a depository deep underground, and for safe transport of the material? The used fuel rods are likely to remain at Sellafield, and will need guarding from terrorists and rising sea levels for centuries to come. Again, the government, ie we, will have to foot the bill. That is not called a subsidy, but it amounts to one by any other name. Legal wrangling will also causesuper delays. Why does nobody mention the building of the high-voltage, direct current European supergrid, which will allow import of electricity from the Sahara, hydro-power from Norway, and geothermal from Iceland at times when we cannot generate solar or wind power, and export electricity when we generate more than we need? Several undersea links are there: to France and Ireland. Last year a cable was laid to the Netherlands. The next link to Norway has already been planned. Why does the energy secretary not mention this project, which won&apos;t expose us to the risk of a nuclear future?Aart and Wiebina HeestermanBirmingham  Is this a Simon Jenkins first? &quot;Do not read on if you want a conclusion on this subject&quot; says Simon to introduce his second paragraph. As he is never normally under-opinionated, perhaps he is starting to realise, as the government already has, thatthere is no easy answer to Britain&apos;s energyfuture. Governments for yearshave read all the reports about the deleterious effects of burning fossil fuels and thefuture cost of the almost certainly increasingreliance on importing them, and tried to nudge energy policy towards other options, but immediately bang up against voters who are against whatever else is offered  nuclear (safety and cost), and renewables (cost and impacts onwhat I would call amenity and ambience rather than environment). The only logical response to my mind istocharge the cost to the taxpayer andignore the amenity, but recent governments, especially this one, won&apos;t increase taxes for that,and are also terrified of campaigns against large-scale and/or highly visible options, as they are mostlyin or proposed for Conservative areas. A further consideration that Jenkins does not mention is that renewables would immediately become more attractiveif a way could be foundto store the intermittent power generated from solar and wind, tokeep the grid goingat night and between weather depressions.I&apos;ve not heard of any work being done in this regard. Anyway, come on Simon, give us a clue, how would you navigate through the &quot;dark underworld&quot; as you put it?David MillsYork  Simon Jenkins is looking for mathematical formulae that will help him understand the complexities of climate change, renewables and nuclear. Let me oblige with three suggestions from a recent conference on climate change organised by Help Rescue the Planet. First RC + MJ = GG where RC stands for Reduced Carbon, MJ for More Jobs and GG for Green Growth. Secondly, EC + R &gt; NO where EC stands for Energy Conservation, R for Renewables and NO for Nuclear Option (In maths &gt; indicates greater than). In other words if the government is planning to spend 100bn to meet our energy requirements, should it spend it on conservation and renewables or on getting Russia or China to build a new generation of nuclear reactors. In political as well as purely economic terms this is a &quot;no brainer&quot;. The third formula was devised by our conference organiser and is the Russell-Jones variant of Einstein&apos;s famous 1905 formula MC2 = E where M stands for multitude (as in world population), C = carbon per capita (ie emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases per head of population per year) and E stands for extinction of species or, for those politicians who calculate that plants and animals don&apos;t vote, it stands for the END of human civilisation as we know it.Michael ClinkChairman, Help Rescue the Planet, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire  If Simon Jenkins is unable to discriminate between James Lovelock and Nigel Lawson on the matter of global climate change, he should cease writing about this topic at all, with immediate effect.Pam LunnKenilworth, Warwickshire",

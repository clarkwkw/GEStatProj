    "text": "The veteran environmental campaigners Jonathon Porritt and Jeremy Leggett are among 100 past and present students and staff who are accusing Oxford University of hypocrisy for accepting funding from Shell for a new Earth sciences laboratory. In a letter published in the Guardian on Thursday, the group maintains that Shell is a &quot;particularly inappropriate choice of funder for an Earth sciences laboratory&quot;. They point out that the Anglo-Dutch company&apos;s core business of oil production is in conflict with research produced by university scientists on the causes and effects of climate change. &quot;As Oxford alumni, staff and students, we are united in our opposition to this new partnership and the growing trend of oil companies funding, and thus influencing, the research agenda of our universities,&quot; the signatories write. They add: &quot;Oxford&apos;s own climate scientists are warning us that we need to leave the majority of known fossil fuels in the ground, and yet this new partnership will undertake research that will help Shell to find and extract even more hydrocarbons.&quot; Among the signatories are Edward Mortimer, the former director of communications to the UN secretary general, and an alumnus of Balliol college. The list also includes George Monbiot, the Guardian columnist and activist, who attended Brasenose college. The Shell Geoscience Laboratory is being officially opened at an event on Thursday and will be attended by the secretary of state for energy and climate change, Ed Davey. The university&apos;s department of Earth sciences already accepts funding from Shell for research doctorates in geochemistry.",

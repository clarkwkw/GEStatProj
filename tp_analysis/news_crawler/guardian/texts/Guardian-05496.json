    "text": "An hour-long &quot;lost&quot; interview with the late Steve Jobs will be released in cinemas next week, after it was acquired for US distribution. Magnolia Pictures is hoping that Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview will spark the interest of legions of admirers of the former CEO of Apple Inc and Pixar, who died in 2011. Technology writer Robert X Cringely (aka Mark Stephens) spoke to Jobs in 1995 as part of a series, The Triumph of the Nerds, a history of the personal computer originally filmed for Channel 4. At the time, Jobs was running NeXT, the computer company he founded after quitting Apple  and shortly before Apple acquired NeXT, enabling Jobs to return to the company he co-founded. Small portions of the interview have been used in TV broadcasts, but the complete footage was thought lost until the discovery of a VHS in director Paul Sen&apos;s garage. Magnolia president Eamonn Bowles said: &quot;It&apos;s a valuable piece of history that has thankfully been rescued from obscurity.&quot;",

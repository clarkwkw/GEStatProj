    "text": "Shyam Visavadia is a graduate with a brilliant CV: a 2:1 in geography and urban and regional planning from the University of Birmingham (2011), internships at Knight Frank, Grainger, Westcombe Group, Savills, Allsop, EC Harris and Barnet and Birmingham city councils, and currently doing a postgrad diploma in surveying. Oh, and he sits on the policy formation board of the regulator of the surveying industry, RICS (Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors). He is unemployed. Intelligent and proactive, Shyam will be successful eventually. But his story warns students that it doesn&apos;t matter how qualified, ambitious or experienced you are, jobs are hard to come by and you may be unlucky. Realising this, I&apos;ve have joined a growing group of &quot;reluctant entrepreneurs&quot;  students who hadn&apos;t previously thought about starting a business, but are worried they may never get a job. Universities are bending over backwards to encourage entrepreneurship. So we reluctant entrepreneurs find ourselves becoming inspired by attending events, networking with the entrepreneurial community, and getting internships working for start-ups. Dave Chapman, director of UCL&apos;s technology entrepreneurship masters programme, says students benefit from acquiring an &quot;action-oriented mindset&quot;, something highly valued by employers apparently. He says his course is attracting lots of interest because of an &quot;increased recognition of entrepreneurship as a career option and UCL&apos;s connections with London&apos;s burgeoning entrepreneurial eco-system&quot;. I call myself &quot;reluctant&quot; not because I think I&apos;m owed a job, or would rather be travelling the world or kicking back with a cup of tea, but because I&apos;ve been raised and educated to aspire to be a good employee. Many young people are reluctant entrepreneurs, even if they have great business ideas, simply because it&apos;s scary to go in the opposite direction to the path our parents and teachers thought they were laying out for us. Now, in a time of job-market unfriendliness, entrepreneurship is the flicker of hope being offered to students across the country, from Enterprise Inc, which works with a group of partner universities including Leicester and Nottingham Trent, to UCL Advances, to the University of Hull&apos;s enterprise centre. Universities are broadening their remit and supplementing the explosion of support for young entrepreneurs from programmes such as Entrepreneur First and Shell Livewire, as well as a a myriad of youth-targeted start-up loans, mentorships and internships. Wannabe entrepreneurs are grabbing their chance with both hands. Karoline Gross, a student on the UCL technology entrepreneurship programme and founder of Smartzer, says: &quot;I have always enjoyed creating projects and managing them, so starting my own business, which essentially is one big project, just happened.&quot; A graduate of the course and co-founder of FaceEnergy, Felipe Escandn Nagel, adds: &quot;I believe that when the financial scenario is not very favourable in the world, more opportunities arise and you have to give yourself a chance to go for them at least once in your life.&quot; Whether you&apos;re a wannabe entrepreneur or a reluctant one, it can&apos;t do any harm to take advantage of the opportunities presented by your university  you don&apos;t know where they may take you.",

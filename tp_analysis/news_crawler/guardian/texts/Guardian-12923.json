    "text": "  1.24am GMT    Summary    Finally the Sony news conference ends. In two hours, we learned:  As expected, Sony is planning to release thePlayStation 4, the first new PlayStation in seven years.  The new console will have a redesigned controller, an eight-core processor and 8gb of memory.  The PlayStation 4 has a focus on social gaming, with gamers able to broadcast their progress and hop in and out of friends&apos; virtual worlds.  Sony did not show what the console actually looked like. Hundreds of thousands watched the two-hour event online. Thanks for reading! Check out our PlayStation 4 news story here.       1.09am GMT    Rock da House    Andrew House returns. He speaks quickly. &quot;Intensified power to enhanced social capabilities,&quot; he says. &quot;We believe playstation 4 proves that we have more to offer than ever before,&quot; he continues. &quot;We look forward to continuing the conversation,&quot; he adds. And just like that, the event ends.       1.03am GMT    A look at some of these new games       Japanese video game producer Yoshinori Ono shows off Capcom's Deep Down. Photograph: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images         1.02am GMT       Andrew House introduces another brand partner as the Sony conference ticks past the two hour mark. It&apos;sBungie, introducing &apos;Destiny&apos;. Dramatic music. Crimson skies. Caves. &quot;It&apos;s an ambitious project,&quot; says a man from Bungie of Bungie&apos;s new game. He introduces four new people onto the stage, to the delight of tired bloggers everywhere. By the way, you might have noticed that the presenting pool has been 100% male tonight...    Congrats on not a single woman taking the stage! #playstation2013&mdash; Will Perkins (@WilliamHPerkins) February 21, 2013     Updated at 1.10am GMT     12.58am GMT       Another game preview. For &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;. Looks good. It seems to revolve around the dangers of sharing private information and the possibility of that information being stolen. Which is ironic. ThenBlizzard Entertainment announces the release of a new &quot;Diablo 3&quot; game for the PS4. &quot;We&apos;re very excited about this product and what the future has in store for us.&quot;       12.48am GMT    Event continues...    Still going here in New York. We get a look at a Square Enix game which features a fire-breathing dragon. Friends can swoop in and help you slay the foul beast. Then Andrew House, who is Welsh, is back up to spout some jargon. Sony and partners are certainly taking their time. But we&apos;re all having fun, right?    Why is this thing so long?? Almost 2 hours so far... #PS4&mdash; Tony A (localzuk) (@localzuk) February 21, 2013     This #PS4 event is running too long, and really, kind of boring, please show the console, and end this soon.&mdash; Moises Soto (@moisoto) February 21, 2013     These console announcements are becoming unbearable... game developers talk more than the console makers! Too long! #WiiU #PS4 #Xbox720&mdash; R. Chase Razabdouski (@ChaseRaz) February 21, 2013     Updated at 12.49am GMT     12.37am GMT       My colleague Erin McCann notes that the PS4 seems to be killing off physical media  &quot;which is interesting because PS3 was a Blue-ray player, and the only one most people ever bought&quot;. She adds:  They&apos;re not talking about which of these games are exclusive to Sony, but it will be interesting to see which ones are also devleoped for the upcoming Xbox 720.     Updated at 12.56am GMT     12.23am GMT    Another controller option: the PS Vita       David Perry, CEO of Gaikai, left, speaks as Mark Cerny, demonstrates remote game play on the PS Vita.

Photograph: BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS         12.21am GMT       Below the line in the commentsHappy Box links to YouTube&apos;s stream of the event, although I think both YouTube and UStream are struggling a bit. pauliepolecathas asked for help with the tech specs of the PS4, andSkropodopoliskindly responds:  @pauliepolecat - well, I&apos;d say it&apos;s pretty much a high-end PC with familiar and static architecture - good for game developers. Devs will probably leverage it more than PS3 which used peculiar processor. Graphics are high-end PC, but again familiar architecture - and DX11, whilst PS3 was DX9 IIRC. So, significant improvements are in lighting and efficiency. Definitely a lot better spec than P3. Highly doubtful you could build a PC system of similar spec at that price. I&apos;m sure you couldn&apos;t actually. So, you&apos;ll get bargain hardware, and pay it back through the software. Because the platform is fixed they can leverage it more than PC equivalent. Looks a very solid platform to me and they should certainly deliver some amazing stuff.     Updated at 12.57am GMT     12.16am GMT    The Witness preview    Big moment asJonathan Blow takes the stage to showcase The Witness. He&apos;s been working on the game since2008 and it is eagerly anticipated. Blow leads us quickly into the preview for the game. I&apos;m switching back into descriptive mode: Picture the scene. A record player in a tree stump. Then a forest. Then a beach. And a castle. And the sea. Whispery vocals and panpipes. A weirdly lit green room. The whispery vocals start going &quot;Ahhhh, ahhh, ahhh&quot;. An electronic platform worms about in a yard. Something shoots a laser off a mirror. The camera swoops out of this little world. Pan pipes fade. THE END.       12.11am GMT       Nate Fox, game director at Sucker Punch Studios, introduces a new game by saying he was once tear-gassed by police. We&apos;ve all been there.Anyway he&apos;s introducing a new game, which will be exclusive to the Playstation 4 Second Son. The live feed was giving me gip through most of it, but I did see a military vehicle explode.       12.03am GMT          Irish video game developer David Perry appears to have lightning coming out of his head. Photograph: BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS         11.58pm GMT    Killzone for Playstation 4 preview    We&apos;re battering through a very pretty looking video now. The share button is showcased again. Send pictures with it, video, live stream, etc. Now we haveHerman Hulst of Guerrilla Games to showcase what the 4 can do. He launches straight into his games pitch. &quot;In the not-too-distant future, there&apos;s a conflict between two warring factions&quot;  bloody typical  &quot;this is Killzone Shadowfall&quot;. We&apos;re shown in-game footage. I&apos;ll describe it. A camera pans down onto a blissful urban utopia, full of rich blues and greens. A glass towerblock. A man. The man is in the process of going through security to get into what appears to be a greenhouse ontop of a towerblock. Then a bomb goes off! Chaos! All of a sudden the sky is grey, the greenhouse full of smoke and fire. Our man has a big gun, and is running around shooting men with red masks on. A helicopter takes off. He grabs a rope hanging from it. Someone&apos;s shooting at him, which is inconvenient, but not for long, because he shoots right back and kills them. He climbs up the rope, into the helicopter. The clip ends. FIN.

Dave Perry,big-wig in the cloud games industry and founder of Gaikai is next. He says the share button on the Playstation 4 controller will mean gamers can broadcast &quot;100% realtime to your friends&quot;. &quot;Your friends will be able to look over your shoulder and interact with you virtually&quot; while you play, Perry says. That sounds a lot like when my mate used to invite me round to watch him play Goldeneye on the N64. But your friends will be able to help too! Perry continues. They&apos;ll be able to help you out with medicines and repairing injuries incurred in-game.    Updated at 11.44pm GMT     11.38pm GMT    New game, new controller       Game designer Mark Cerny talks about the new controller, Bioshock 4. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images       Cerny introduces his new game &ndash; Knack Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images       And a close-up of the new controller Photograph: BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS      Updated at 11.52pm GMT     11.32pm GMT       Cerny says Playstation 4 will be an &quot;exponential leap&quot; over its predecessors. Gamers will be able to interact their tablets and smartphones with the console. Playstation &quot;continues to offer the best place to play&quot;, Cerny conclues, and adds that he is &quot;thrilled about the vast potential for the Playstation 4 to develop new and even more powerful gaming experiences&quot;. So...       11.26pm GMT    New controller    Here&apos;s a look at that snazzy new controller. It will sync up with a camera interface, according to Cerny.    The DualShock 4. Loving the mood lighting. twitter.com/kezamacdonald/&mdash; Keza MacDonald (@kezamacdonald) February 20, 2013        11.23pm GMT       Cerny leans down and picks up a brand new Playstation 4 controller that was apparently just knocking about on the floor. He uses it to show off a game he&apos;s designed  his return to game direction  called Knack in which a creature called Knack fights goblins. &quot;[Knack] will be invaluable in the fight against the goblins,&quot; says one of the characters. Knack can use his surroundings to grow bigger and thus become more effective at goblin slaying, it seems. The video ends to applause. Oh and in the meantime, Sony has sponsored a tweet that sounds just a little bit smug.    That's right -- PlayStation 4.&mdash; PlayStation (@PlayStation) February 20, 2013        11.16pm GMT    Ecosystems evolving, preference-driven paths emerging    Mark Cerny has taken the stage, and immediately started waffling. The design team &quot;looked at how the Playstation&apos;s ecosystem could evolve&quot; he says. Evolve to provide a &quot;dynamic preference-driven path through the world of content,&quot; he says. Cerny is talking in a whispery, awe-struck tone, eyes wide, hair floppy. He developed Sonic and Crash Bandicoot and is a Sony big cheese.    Updated at 11.26pm GMT     11.10pm GMT    Playstation 4 exists!    There is a Playstation 4. House just said it. And PS4 just popped up on the screen. We aren&apos;t all here for nothing.    Logo de PlayStation 4 #MeriPS4 twitter.com/Caith_Sith/sta&mdash; Pablo Gonzlez (@Caith_Sith) February 20, 2013     Updated at 11.11pm GMT     11.09pm GMT    In da House    Andrew House is up at the Hammerstein ballroom. He hasn&apos;t launched anything yet. In his opening remarks he addresses one of the issues consoles face  competition from tablets and phones that can be used on the go.  We&apos;ll show you in which the living room is no longer the center of the playstation eco-system. The gamer is.  Before House we had a little glimpse of the original Playstation in a snazzy, dance-music backed video. Memories of Tenchu: Stealth Assassins come flooding back.       11.01pm GMT       Just jazzy music from the Sony livestream at the moment. Sax heavy. It sounds like the music you might hear during the opening credits of a 1980s cop film. Not going down well on teh internetz.    Creepy sex music has sounded to initiate the beginning of the Sony press conference crab lecture type o' thing.&mdash; Michael Healy (@SenatorHealy) February 20, 2013        10.54pm GMT    Great Expectations    So what can we expect to see from the new Playstation? At risk of just copying and pasting Keith Stuart&apos;s knowledge and wisdom, he did write about this last week. The meat, Keith reckons, is in the specs:  Right now, documentsposted on the VGLeaks siteand the titbits we&apos;ve managed to squeeze from developers suggest an eight-core processor set-up based around AMD&apos;s Jaguar technology; a GPU utilising AMD&apos;s R10XXSouthern Islandsarchitecture; 4GB system memory; and Blu-ray drive. Eurogamer has an immense analysis of these specifications and how they compare with rumoured Xbox Durango featureshere. The information suggests, as many predicted, a much less expensive architecture than the PS3, and one that will be familiar to coders already working with high-end PC hardware. But will there be any extra surprises, like support for 4K screens?  But there&apos;s also those leaked controller images, showing some reworking to the current design. &quot;Rumours also suggest Move-style motion functionality, a microphone and a headphone socket. Documentation seen by various game sites has also mentioned a Share button, which may well allow gamers to take screen grabs or video clips to post on a social network,&quot; Keith wrote. Check out the rest of our speculation here.    Prototype Playstation 4 controller leaked (via Kotaku) #playstation2013 twitter.com/Kevin_Oliver/s&mdash; Kevin Oliver (@Kevin_Oliver) February 14, 2013        10.38pm GMT       Built in 1906, the elegant old Hammerstein ballroom in New York City will be hosting a very modern show tonight, writes Keith Stuart.It&apos;s here that Sony will usher in the next generation of video game entertainment, finally unveiling its successor to the 70-million selling PlayStation 3 console. At least that&apos;s the world&apos;s press is assuming: the corporation, which launched the original PlayStation back in 1994, is keeping its cue cards close to its chest. All we know is that we&apos;re being shown the future of the PlayStation business. If that&apos;s not PlayStation 4 there are going to be a lot of angry tech journalists in here. Tonight&apos;s event will be hosted by Andrew House, the President and Group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, but Sony have told us to expect other guests on stage. That will doubtless include Kaz Hirai, the president and CEO of Sony and a cult figure with gamers. We&apos;re expecting the tech specs of the new console to be revealed - leaked documents suggest its a mighty eight core AMD processor aided by a state-of-the-art graphics processing unit, also by AMD.     Old faithful  rumours are rife that the Playstation 4 will see an upgraded controller. Photograph: Rex Features    We&apos;re also expecting a redesigned version of the Dual Shock controller, complete with its own touch pad, motion sensors and a microphone. Sony is also hinting that it will revolutionaries its online offering, perhaps with a subscription-based streaming service  a sort of Spotify for games. There are rumours we&apos;ll also see some cool new social networking features including the ability to quickly capture and share screenshots and video of games your playing. Andof course, this being a modern console launch, nothing will be complete without an array of video-on-demand partnerships. Netflix, LoveFilm, etc, will no doubt be hovering in the wings. As for games  the launch titles are going to be all important. We can probably expect a new Killzone shooter, perhaps word of a Gran Turismo driving game and teasers of other PlayStation favourites - maybe Uncharted 4, LittleBigPlanet 3 maybe even something new? Stranger things have happened. Whatever, the significance is huge for Sony - and the wider industry. Console and game sales are falling in both the US and Europe, and Wii U has not made the impact Nintendo expected - this business needs a hero right now; a new beginning. PlayStation 4 looks to be a powerful machine, that won&apos;t be hideously expensive to manufacture so it could be coming in at less that 350 - that would be big, too. The key thing is, there&apos;s a lot of excitement here, a real buzz. This may well be the biggest video game hardware launch night since Sony first revealed the PS3 back in 2005. The future is coming to the Hammerstein ballroom - we just don&apos;t know what it looks like yet.     This is a gorgeous old ballroom. Photograph: BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS      Updated at 12.06am GMT     10.14pm GMT       Good evening and welcome to our live blog coverage of this week&apos;s big technology launch  the unveiling in New York of Sony&apos;s next-generation gaming system. The electronics giant, which has struggled in recent years in competition with its more nimble competitors, hopes that the new console will boost its position in a tough market. Its main competitor, Microsoft, is due to reveal the next-generation Xbox later this year. Sony&apos;s decision to eschew its home country of Japan and hold the event in the US, underlines the importance of the American market. Worldwide, sales of the the Playstation 3 outstrip the Xbox 360, but in the US Sony trails its Microsoft rival. Somewhat unusually, the event is being held in the evening, starting at 6pm ET, presumably to maximise primetime online chatter in the US while catching the morning market in Japan, where it will be 8am. The Guardian&apos;s games blogger, Keith Stuart, is at the event at theHammerstein ballroom in Midtown Manhattanand, Wi-Fi permitting, we&apos;ll have updates from him as the event progresses. While we wait for the event to start, here&apos;s Keith&apos;s excellent preview piece.    Updated at 10.46pm GMT  ",

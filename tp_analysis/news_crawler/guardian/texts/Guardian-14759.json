    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Not a true sequel, but far larger than mere downloadable content, Dragon&apos;s Dogma: Dark Arisen is an expansion pack that generously includes the entire original game in case you happened to miss it. As well as the original levels, players get a new mysterious subterranean realm, Bitterblack Isle. It&apos;s clearly intended for seasoned players, because the new beasts tend towards the brutally difficult, including the towering, scythe-wielding figure of Death itself, who must be dealt with over multiple encounters. Ominous, deadly and hugely involving, Dark Arisen is a fitting extension for Capcom&apos;s superb and underappreciated role-playing game.",

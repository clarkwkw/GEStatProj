    "text": "Prototype 2, PS3 &amp; Xbox 360 Poor old New York&apos;s back in the frame for the apocalypse treatment, this time following a viral outbreak caused by the first game&apos;s antihero, Alex Mercer.  Playing as another genetically altered misfit, sergeant James Heller, your job is to take on the sinister corporate Blackwatch while finding a way to go after Mercer himself. Naturally the virus turns all and sundry into zombies, the game designer&apos;s favourite mindless fist fodder, who along with mutants and an army of black-clad paramilitaries give you plenty to swing your various blades and tendrils at. Unlike the all-out action of the first game, Prototype 2 also depends on assuming others&apos; identities to enter buildings and get close to targets. It&apos;s mostly about the action, though; the ability to fly short distances is available right from the start and it&apos;s followed by an amusing catalogue of skills that soon let you rip missile pods and mini-guns from passing tanks and helicopters, fly over entire city blocks, and generally wreak merry chaos. Activision, 39.99-44.99 Sniper Elite V2, PS3 &amp; Xbox 360     Sniper Elite V2    Sniper Elite V2 has you picking your way through the smoking ruins of Berlin in the final weeks of the second world war. You&apos;re in pursuit of rocket scientists, against an onslaught of hyper-vigilant German and Russian troops. The best bits of the game involve using your binoculars to conduct cautious surveys of your surroundings, taking aim, waiting for a loud noise to mask your gunfire and squeezing the trigger. If successful, you&apos;re treated to a bullet&apos;s-eye view of the shot, ending in a slow-motion, rotating &quot;X-ray kill cam&quot; as it smashes through your target&apos;s skeleton. While gruesomely effective, its relentless overuse makes it lose all impact. The game also features numerous ill-advised action sequences for which the game&apos;s controls, cover system and absence of quick-save mechanism are wholly unsuited. As in many games, playing sniper is a guilty pleasure you wish it would let you indulge a bit more. 505 Games, 34.99-39.99 Games news     Back To The Future    Shinji Mikami, the creator of Resident Evil, has announced a new survival horror project codenamed Zwei. Although details are some way off, he promises a scary rather than simply action-packed experience  Despite things not having been quite as bad as initially forecast, Nintendo has declared its first financial loss in 30 years and Zynga, maker of mega-hit Farmville and little else of any note, has posted losses of $85m  Also out this week are Back To The Future (PC, PS3, Wii), a charming, puzzly adventure based on the classic film series  Cats &amp; Dogs 3D: Pets At Play (3DS) bringing more three-dimensional domesticated animal hi-jinks to Nintendo&apos;s handheld  Mortal Kombat (Vita) has arrived in portable format, although complaints are already emerging about its graphical compromises  Finally, Phil Taylor&apos;s Power Play Darts 3D (3DS) lets you enjoy the classic pub game wherever you happen to be.

The Future of Games: F2P Is Not Evil Nor The Only Solution | GamesIndustry International Will Luton:  Free-to-play has fractured the industry, creating smug preaching zealots in the column inches (hello, mum) and neo-luddite reactionaries decrying the advance from the conference podiums. Anti-F2P rhetoric from the bleeding hearts is just as much the mind-numbing wibble as &quot;the only way&quot; lectures from the moneymen. &quot;Public discussions and formalisation of concepts such as Skinner Box experiments and core loops seemed shallow, cold and greedy&quot; This nonsense of drawing us-and-them divides and speaking in unwavering certainty is making fools of us all. F2P is divisive when it needn&apos;t be. This is a call for the inevitable restoration of common sense.  A reasoned look at the ever-present F2P debate. The Real Sega Pluto  Assembler Games forum An amazing post on the Assember rare games forum from someone claiming to be a former Sega employee showing off a prototype Pluto console: essentially a Saturn with a built in Netlink modem:  A little more background info -- as most of you know, Sega is a company with a history of turmoil. Employee turnover is a sad theme, and the Sonic Reaper (as we call him) strikes all too frequently. As such, the past gets forgotten quickly -- treasures from the previous generation are quickly cast aside, as a new regime tries to make a name for themselves (or justify their existence). As such, some of said treasures get left on laid-off-peoples&apos; desks. And in a beautiful twist of fate, this beauty ended up finding its way to my desk, and then in a box with the rest of my stuff when I left Sega. I was told that only two of these prototypes were made -- and this is #2. This thing is a beast, and definitely the heaviest console I&apos;ve ever held in my hands. The front features two controller ports, and on top you have a flip-top drive bay, a cart slot, a Power button, and the venerable Reset button. Note that the logo still says Saturn, so I&apos;m guessing the Pluto codename was simply that, and they were thinking of branding it with the Saturn name. (The logo is printed on production-style though, so I&apos;m guessing they were fairly serious about this one.) The left and right sides feature beautiful-and-exotic vents, while the back is standard Saturn, save for the Netlink ports. The bottom has nothing of note except for the &quot;PLUTO-02&quot; sticker (which is, of course, of note).  Wow, Sega really did get through almost all the solar system between Mega Drive and Dreamcast! UnderCurrent aims to bring deep sea exploration to Oculus Rift | Joystiq  UnderCurrent is an Unreal-powered deep sea exploration game designed for Oculus Rift from a group of university students over in the UK. The group became fascinated with VR technology and has already put together three different levels, though the collective notes that some of the core mechanics of UnderCurrent are still undetermined.  You can read more about this project on the student workblog.  Microsoft&apos;s Zoo unveiled - screens of canned Xbox sim are Viva Pinata with Avatars | The Official Magazine  Once upon a time, Frontier Developments of Kinectimals and &quot;David Braben hates pre-owned&quot; fame was working on a reboot of Zoo Tycoon for Xbox, known as Microsoft Zoo. That&apos;s according to former lead artist and UI team leader Anil Glendinning, who has posted a number of screenshots on his personal site. &quot;Part zoo creation and part animal interaction, this 3rd person adventure was all charm and lay the groundwork for what would eventually become Kinectimals,&quot; Glendinning recalls.  Team Bondi staff sacked, Whore of the Orient development on hold | Eurogamer.net  Staff have been let go at L.A. Noire developer Team Bondi and development of its upcoming open-world game Whore of the Orient put on hold as the studio faces a new round of financial woes. Warner Bros. pulled out of its unannounced publishing deal &quot;right before last Christmas&quot;, Superannuation reported. It&apos;s unclear how many staff remain at the developer. MCV Pacific states that the studio itself has not yet shut down.  Sad news for the troubled studio  and this was a fascinating next-gen project. Are social games on Facebook really dying out? | Gamasutra  First Electronic Arts said that it is pulling its most popular games from Facebook, raising questions over whether it plans to shut down its Playfish social games subsidiary. Then figures from metrics tracking firm SuperData showed that last month, the social games segment reached a new low of $124 million in total revenue. The social games space is holding back the overall digital space, says the company. But has this week been the final nail in the coffin for the social games space, or has it simply opened up the floor for a host of new developers to try their luck?  This sector clearly needs to evolve; there are plenty of companies making a success of it, but the wider possibilities of social gaming are not being explored  possibly not helped by the fact that Facebook is an ever-shifting platform. Ad-blockers, the games press, and why sexy cosplay galleries lead to better reporting | The PA Report Ben Kuchera:  People like to say that the games press is just chasing page views with certain stories, but let&apos;s be honest: We&apos;re chasing page views with every story. This is the reality of the business. It takes so many page views and so many uniques to stay in business, you find yourself going after stories you know will be popular. You may pass up covering games that don&apos;t have a large following. You may break one long story into two chunks to stretch it out. You do anything to get people to click.  This is an interesting and revealing piece in the financial realities of running a video game site. And it led to... My Proposed- but very likely half baked- Way To Fix Game Journalism/Criticism | davidjaffe.biz ... this controversial response from game developer David Jaffe who wants to fix games journalism with crowd funding:  Ok so anyway- we get a bunch of names of people doing great work in game journalism and then we- as a game community- vote and whittle it to 5 names. Then we do a yearly Kickstarter to raise 175K. 125 K goes to pay 1 of the 5 reporters (pulled randomly from a hat or voted on by the folks who contributed to the Kstart) a yearly salarty. The remaining 50K goes to pay for expenses (games, travel). The reporter posts whatever they want on a blog. There is no editor, no advertising/sales group to worry about, and they can update when they want and write about whatever they want. The only harm for doing a bad job (and I define a bad job as simply filing way too few stories) is looking terrible in the public eye that funded them and wiping out their chances of being included in next year&apos;s list.  Oh David, everyone needs an editor... You can follow Press Start at Pinboard.",

It is easy to imagine that by now some readers will be a bit jaded with the whole &apos;yet another feathered dinosaur&apos; thing. We do now have hundreds of specimens of non-avian dinosaurs preserved with feathers intact representing a couple of dozen species. While new finds and new techniques are always going to have the potential to provide new information, are there really major new things to learn? Well yes there certainly are, and a new paper out in Science today does just that and significantly suggests that we might yet find many more fossils in more places than we previously thought possible. First though, a point about evolution and palaeontology. Evolution as a scientific theory allows us to make predictions that can then be later tested or confirmed. In the case of the fossil record, we can look at features of existing species or specimens, put them in an evolutionary context, and hypothesise what other finds we can expect to find. If we look at a family tree of the more derived theropod dinosaurs for example (on the line close to birds) we now have feathered representatives of numerous groups, though there is a gap. A group called the ornithomimosaurus (the &apos;bird mimics&apos;) do not have any specimens known preserved with feathers, when groups that came before them (like tyrannosaurs and compsognathids) and after them (like therizinosaurs and dromaeosaurs) do.  We would predict therefore that the ornithomimosaurs did indeed have feathers, inheriting them from their ancestors, but that we simply have yet to find a specimen preserving them. Well that prediction can now be confirmed as this new study presents not one but three specimens of the ornithomimosaur Ornithomimus preserving feathers. It is more than a little appropriate than over a century since they were first identified, a group of dinosaurs identified as being bird-like in their named can now be positively identified to have had feathers. Ornithomimosaurs really do have the appearance of a very large bird like an ostrich  long legs, a relatively small body and a small head perched atop a long neck. Apart from the clawed hands and the rather long tail, one could be forgiven for mistaking the skeleton of one of these dinosaurs for an exceptionally large rhea or ostrich at a distance (though these gross similarities are due to convergence rather than direct ancestry). Clothe one in a good coat of feathers and the differences are reduced still further. That we do now have ornithomimosaurs preserved with feather is in itself a nice find, but there&apos;s more to these specimens that filling in this gap. The three finds between them represent both young and adult animals, and there is some evidence that the juvenile animal had a different pattern of feathers on its body than the adults. This matches what has already been seen in another feathered dinosaurs, Similicaudipteryx, but still represents additional data to confirm the hypothesis that as with modern birds, non-avian dinosaurs had different feathers when young to that at adult. What is of greatest interest however, is that these specimens come from Alberta in Canada. To date all but a tiny number of feathered dinosaurs have come from a couple of major fossil localities in China and one from southern Germany and all had some preservational features in common. These new finds don&apos;t just come from a different continent (which is great in itself) but from a rock type that previously we didn&apos;t think likely to be capable of preserving feathers. That means that not only is there great potential for finding more feathered dinosaurs in these rocks in Canada (and it is a place which has produced plenty of dinosaurs before so hope are high) but that other, similar formations might also yield feathered forms. In short this paper has a near perfect scientific hat-trick, it fulfils a scientific prediction about evolution, confirms a previous hypothesis with more information, and it also provides good evidence that we can expect more find and more data. One last thing, Ornithomimus comes from fossil beds that have also produced Tyrannosaurus rex material. It really may be that if old rexy did have feathers, we could find a specimen showing that, something previously considered unlikely to impossible in those deposits. These new finds are important in their own right, but also reveal what else we may yet learn.

    "text": "With Tiger having recently reclaimed the world No1 spot, the timing could not be better for EA&apos;s latest in its long-running series but, as is the tendency with annually updated sport sims, this is evolution not revolution. A slight polish of the visuals, a few new game modes and a tweak to the excellently crafted controls is all that veterans will notice. The career mode is still fabulously in-depth, offering the opportunity to guide a young upstart through to the pros to compete at the majors  all four of which are now playable for the first time, as is the chance to create a female avatar. Most interesting, however, is the sepia-toned Legends of the Majors mode, which offers an in-game history of the sport, allowing you to play some of the all-time great tournaments and courses.",

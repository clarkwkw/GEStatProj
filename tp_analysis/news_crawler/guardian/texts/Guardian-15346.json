    "text": "The last time I saw Justin Fletcher in the flesh, he was on the main stage at the Camp Bestival music festival, and I was in a crowd of thousands of parents with children on shoulders, bouncing to a Hi-NRG version of Happy And You Know It. He quite possibly drew the biggest crowd of the weekend, which is a sign of the regard held by children and parents alike for Fletcher. CBeebies shows like Something Special, Gigglebiz and Justin&apos;s House have made him a household name in the UK. Now he&apos;s launching his own series of iOS apps under the &quot;Justin&apos;s World&quot; brand, starting with an interactive retelling of Goldilocks &amp; The Three Bears, which is released tomorrow (17 May). The app blends animation, educational mini-games and live-action video of Fletcher himself, telling the story and gamely leaping about dressed up as Goldilocks herself. The app is aimed at preschool-age children, and will be followed by two more (at least) in the coming months. Fletcher and co-creator Allan Johnston met 12 years ago when working on children&apos;s TV show Tikkabilla, and then jointly came up with Something Special the groundbreaking CBeebies show that prominently featured children with special needs, and used Makaton sign language. &quot;A few years ago, we wouldn&apos;t even be talking about doing an app. We&apos;d probably be collaborating on a DVD or another TV format,&quot; says Fletcher, in an interview with The Guardian. &quot;I&apos;m a bit antiquated when it comes to technology, but I&apos;m astounded at the way children are now using apps from a very young age as a learning tool. It seems like a natural progression to explore that format.&quot; Johnston chips in: &quot;The screen is changing from what we know as a television screen. It can be whatever you want to be: TV, computer, gaming device. That is the world the children are growing up with.&quot; The Goldilocks app stands out from most of the children&apos;s apps that are already available, and not just because it&apos;s fronted by a TV star. The video elements make it feel more televisual, with the plain-white backgrounds very reminiscent of the signing scenes in Something Special. That&apos;s a deliberate choice. &quot;The key is the simplicity of the format. It&apos;s not too busy, there&apos;s no background and no distraction,&quot; says Fletcher. &quot;I wanted to take what we do on television to create that on the phone or tablet,&quot; says Fletcher. &quot;I think we&apos;ve achieved that: a huge amount of our audience are so young, so we didn&apos;t want to be too glitzy or too fast-paced.&quot; Johnston adds that the pair were keen from the start for parents to feel comfortable with the Justin&apos;s World apps, both in terms of their content and the way they make money they&apos;re paid downloads with no in-app purchases or advertising. &quot;There are some lovely children&apos;s apps out there, but a lot of stuff too that&apos;s just there to make money,&quot; he says. &quot;Of course, we need to make a living out of it, but we wanted to make something meaningful, memorable and which also had value to it. We&apos;re very clear that if you buy the app, you have complete ownership of it rather than having to pay more. If we want to do something else, we&apos;ll create another app.&quot; Fletcher also says he&apos;s very keen to ensure the apps can be used by children and their parents together, rather than just the children: he doesn&apos;t see the iPad as a babysitting device.      Johnston has some theories about how apps differ from TV shows in their educational value for children, based on his 12 years working in educational broadcasting. He explains a TV industry theory about how children learn: &quot;Romance, precision and generalisation&quot;. By which he means they first get romantically engaged in a subject, then learn the precision the nuts and bolts before generalising into other areas, which leads on to other romances. &quot;Television was brilliant at the romance, but what it was really bad at was teaching the precision. In the linear model, if a child is thinking &apos;I don&apos;t quite understand&apos; you&apos;ve already moved on,&quot; he says. &quot;But the precision is what apps are really good at. Here, we can romantically engage the child through the storytelling with Justin, and then get into those interactive moments to teach the precision.&quot; The educational content in the Goldilocks app is worn lightly, with an emphasis on learning through play rather than being hit over the head with tests and exercises. &quot;There wasn&apos;t even a discussion. It was taken as absolutely read that they would be of educational value,&quot; says Fletcher, with both men crediting their experience working with CBeebies as making this a given for every new project that they have started. Fletcher mentions his lack of technological expertise several times during the interview, but exploring apps is a logical move for someone who has become a bona-fide brand in his own right in the world of children&apos;s entertainment. He says he loves working with CBeebies, so this isn&apos;t an attempt to break free of traditional broadcasting. But it is another way along with live shows of making a direct connection with his young fans and their parents. &quot;CBeebies have been unbelievably supportive: I work for the BBC exclusively [on TV] and always have done. I&apos;m very happy where I am. Children&apos;s television is a tough market, but I&apos;ve established myself over a period of 18 or 19 years now,&quot; he says. &quot;And every five years you get a new audience, and can try to reinvent yourself. I never look at myself as a children&apos;s presenter. I&apos;m a performer, an actor. I like to explore different worlds and formats.&quot; How much more exploration will he be doing with Justin&apos;s World apps? The first one is imminent, with the following two well on the way to release. Then Fletcher and Johnston will take stock. &quot;We&apos;re going to see how they go. We&apos;re both quite new to this platform,&quot; says Fletcher, who is keen not to rush any more apps at the expense of the quality of their content not to mention the chance to learn from feedback on the first three. &quot;Even if it is successful, we aren&apos;t going to bust a gut to get more content out before it&apos;s ready. It&apos;s about the quality and integrity of the content,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a bit like an animated film. You can throw millions at it, but if it hasn&apos;t got the storyline and the heart, it won&apos;t do so well. That&apos;s certainly true of programme-making, and we think it may be true of apps and software too.&quot;",

    "text": "If you&apos;re a creative arts student involved in a university-run community project, you&apos;re part of a dying tradition. For decades, UK art schools have prided themselves on developing community projects that benefit local people. This could include anything from helping students bring art&apos;s restorative powers to prisoners, or to showing local people how to regenerate their area. The practice grew out of the Community Arts movement and was formalised by Dartington College in Devon in the eighties, becoming common in art departments around the country. The arts funding system encouraged this outreach work, by awarding grants to projects aimed at getting more people involved in arts and culture. But 30 years on in the university sector, these types of projects are much thinner on the ground. There are several reasons for this, from colleges&apos; lack of resources to their high staff turnover, which makes it difficult for institutions to build lasting relationships with the local community. Mik Pieniazek, product innovation lecturer at the University of Salford, explains: &quot;In order to make cost efficiencies, areas of the curriculum become conflated into more general programmes. Fewer courses are explicitly entitled as having social perspectives. &quot;But the creative community within institutions remain true to current issues. For example, our students are involved in designing saleable products for Big Issue sellers, that the sellers will be able to make themselves.&quot; But is this the exception or the rule? There are only a handful of post-graduate courses that are training artists on how to work with different communities, such as the MA in community and participatory arts at the University of Staffordshire. PALACE is an ambitious project undertaken on this course by student Clare Reynolds, created from real stories of people affected by homelessness, and performed at the Bethesda Chapel in Stoke on Trent by a mixed cast of professionals and amateurs, aged five-60.

Some are now getting involved with homelessness charities. We also worked with the charity Arts North Staffs, delivering animation workshops with young people at risk of homelessness, which were used in the performance&quot; says Reynolds. &quot;PALACE is my dissertation case study,&quot; she adds. &quot;It&apos;s looking at site-specific performance and its potential impact on communities, places and participants. With my performance company Restoke, we&apos;re striving to create professional quality community performances that help to raise aspirations for the participants in terms of what they can achieve.&quot; One undergraduate course that is &quot;old style&quot; in its community principles is the BA in applied performance at Birmingham City University. Course director Hannah Phillips agrees: &quot;Words have changed. We&apos;re &apos;applied&apos; rather than &apos;community&apos;, but we&apos;re making work with clear social and political objectives and we use performance as a tool to raise awareness, educate and empower.&quot; Phillips, who trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama, has recently developed the performance piece She with 30 second-year students. This powerful interdisciplinary work explores the exploitation of girls in gangs, where sexual grooming, abusive relationships and rape is becoming more common. &quot;There&apos;s been a lot of work, time and media attention about young males&apos; relationships with gangs, but little about young women, and we know it&apos;s a growing issue in this city. Rape is now becoming the weapon of choice for gangs, which is really concerning.&quot;     Students perform She at Birmingham City University. Photograph: Graeme Braidwood    She was performed to 540 young people, mainly year 10 girls, in 21 shows last December. There were also after-show question and answer sessions facilitated by Birmingham and Solihull Women&apos;s Aid. &quot;An early outcome is that eight year 10 girls have self-referred themselves to Women&apos;s Aid as a result of watching She&apos;&quot; says Phillips. A fact, she adds, that demonstrates how this type of project can change people&apos;s lives. Student performer Nicola Genner describes the all-singing, all-dancing show. &quot;It follows the stories of two girls, Tori and Sophie. There was a grooming storyline, and a domestic abuse situation, where the boy hit the girl, which was done through movement. The end was about empowerment, a song with lyrics that were uplifting and poignant. &quot;Every performance was so different. We went from workshops for 14, to performances to 200 people, and you could feel the different atmosphere it created. It was a very emotional experience, to look out at the audience and see an individual crying because of the impact of what you are performing. But that was also the worst thing, to go backstage afterwards and not know if that person has been able to access services and receive help.&quot;     Students perform She at Birmingham City University. Photograph: Graeme Braidwood    Danielle Cairns, another performer, agrees that making She was challenging: &quot;I was quite shocked going through the whole process. We told real women&apos;s stories, some verbatim. It felt very relevant because in the news it was being reported that a paedophile ring had groomed young girls. No performance could be less than 100% because it wasn&apos;t just about the performance, it was about the message.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a brilliant course&quot; says Cairns. &quot;It&apos;s not just about performance skills. We learn about different types of theatre, different types of communities and vulnerable people. It helps us decide what we want to specialise in, what we want to do with our lives, and it gives us the opportunity to challenge stereotypes and say, it&apos;s ok to talk about this.&quot; She already knows that she wants to teach performing arts at secondary school. &quot;Other courses lack this practical element, the facilitation work or the work experience. I don&apos;t feel that when you are sat at tables you can reach out to the community.&quot; Genner agrees. &quot;I see it as improving ourselves to more effectively help others. This course is giving us valuable professional experience and insight, not just by performing in professional theatre venues like the Drum, but also through work placements  I&apos;m spending 6 weeks with Friction Arts as a general assistant.&quot; So it seems there are still a few art departments that are promoting community work. Given this area has provided employment for arts graduates, and is still a potential source of income even in current straitened times, it really is surprising that so many of these courses have been &quot;rationalised&quot; out of existence.",

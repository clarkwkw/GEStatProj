It will be used in shallow reef to take 360-degree, geolocated panoramic images every 4-6 seconds while traveling at a speed of approximately 4kph Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey       Paul Trefy is currently putting the finishing touches to the SVII prototype in preparation for the official launch in Singapore Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey       To improve the fluid dynamics of the camera when travelling underwater, the design team has taken inspiration from the natural design of sharks and other marine life Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey       SVII and a diver. The project was unveiled via a live link from underwater on the Great Barrier Reef to the World Oceans Summit in Singapore  Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey       The scientists and conservationists behind the Catlin Seaview Survey hope the attraction of 'virtual diving' will also raise awareness about climate change, coral bleaching, deepwater ecology and the breeding habits of invertebrates Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey       The expedition will start in September, with images expected to be available soon after on a dedicated YouTube channel as well as Panoramio, Google Earth, Google Maps and a custom-made 360-degree viewer Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey       A green turtle. These images come from a six-day pilot mission, when scientists said they found a new species of pygmy seahorse and four types of coral that had never been seen in the region Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey       A green turtle. The study will focus on three areas: shallow reefs will be captured in colourful 360-degree panoramas, deep reefs will be shown in more limited detail due to the lack of light, and there will also be an effort to track the migration and breeding patterns of manta rays, tiger sharks and green turtles  Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey       A batfish. Many more discoveries are likely as 93% of the reef is unexplored because it is too deep for scuba divers Photograph: Catlin seaview survey       A humphead wrasse. The cost of the project has not been disclosed, but its backers hope that it can be expanded to underwater environments elsewhere in the world Photograph: Catlin Seaview Survey  ",

    "text": "Michael Hintze CEO CQS Management Limited33 Chester StreetLondon SW1X 7BL 21 September 2011 Dear Michael We assume that our previous letter to you, attached, somehow slipped your attention as we realise that you are really busy and may have been away. We do assure you that we will not be writing to you repeatedly. However, because of the urgent need for action on climate change and health, illustrated by events in the last few months, we are taking the liberty of contacting you again to request support for the XXX.  XXX focus is XXX but as you will agree, this requires as strong mitigation and adaptation as we, as a society, can muster.   XXX biggest problem is lack of funding. To date members have worked with &quot;pro bono&quot; and &quot;in kind&quot;. Funding needs are modest but necessary to undertake a series of planned projects. It is seeking to raise XXX from private sources to deliver on its policy, research and advocacy priorities and enable it to remain independent. Breakdown of this funding need is: Website = XXX Policy/position papers = XXX Health effects of fossil fuels report = XXX Scoping paper on voluntary accreditation for health care organisations = XXX Administrative and operational costs, including office and phone = XXX In addition, we would like to fund priority research, to be agreed by the executive, for funding Masters and PhD students up to XXX and to also fund conference development and attendance up to XXX. We do believe that the work of XXX would link well with that of your Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney and with your agreement, would like to establish contact.  We would be happy to provide you with any other information you require, set up a conference call with you, or meet face-to-face. XXX is will be attending the Durban conference on Climate Change and Health in December and XXX will be in the UK again in February 2012.  It would be wonderful and extremely helpful if you could provide some funding for this developing group and, of course, we would acknowledge any support you could provide. We look forward to hearing from you.  With best wishes Yours sincerely XXX",

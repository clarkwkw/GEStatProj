    "text": "International aid for primary school education has fallen for the first time since 2002, with many of the largest cuts to programmes in the poorest countries, according to a new report (pdf). An analysis of international aid statistics by Unesco and the Education for All campaign, published ahead of a high-level meeting on education in New York on Tuesday, shows global funding for basic education dropped 6% between 2010 and 2011, with six of the world&apos;s top 10 donors  Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway and the US  cutting their spending. The cuts mean the UK is now the world&apos;s largest bilateral aid donor for basic education. These cuts, which have fallen hardest on low-income countries, &quot;jeopardise the chances of schooling for millions of children&quot;, says the report. It warns that if current trends continue it is unlikely the world will meet its &quot;modest commitment&quot; to get every child into school by 2015. According to the report, the Netherlands, one of the world&apos;s largest funders of basic education in developing countries, cut its support to the sector by more than 30% between 2010 and 2011 because it decided &quot;to phase out education programmes that do not contribute directly to its foreign policy priorities&quot;. Japanese aid for basic education also fell 30% over the same period, with Canadian support dropping by 21%. Among multilateral donors, support from the EU fell by almost one-third between 2010 and 2011, the result of a reduction in aid to dozens of developing countries, including Bangladesh, India, Malawi and Papua New Guinea. Pauline Rose, director of the Education for All Global Monitoring Report, said dramatic year-on-year changes make it hard for countries to predict how much aid they will receive. &quot;Many developing countries rely on this aid to enable them to provide a good quality education to their children. It is essential that donors maintain their funding, and make sure it is reaching the countries  and children  most in need,&quot; she said. Low-income countries have been particularly hard hit by donor cuts, says the report. Aid for basic education in sub-Saharan Africa fell 7% between 2010 and 2011, for example, while support to Nigeria, which is home to the largest number of out-of-school children, dropped by more than a quarter. The World Bank, while increasing its aid to basic education overall, cut the amount it gives to low-income countries by almost 25%. Meanwhile, progress on reducing the number of children out of school has ground to a &quot;virtual standstill&quot;, according to the report, which previews new UN data showing 57 million children were out of school in 2011, compared with 59 million in 2010. &quot;If this rate of change continues over the next few years, the world will still be far from the goal of UPE [universal primary education] in 2015,&quot; it says. The report warns of a &quot;twin crisis&quot; in education, arguing that attention must focus not only on getting children into school, but ensuring they receive a quality education. While 137 million children began primary school in 2011, at least 34 million left before completing a full course, the report says. This means a dropout rate of 25%  the same as in 2000. The Unesco director-general, Irina Bokova, said: &quot;The world must move beyond helping children enter school to also ensure that they actually learn the basics when they are there. Our twin challenge is to get every child in school by understanding and acting on the multiple causes of exclusion, and to ensure they learn with qualified teachers in healthy and safe environments.&quot; Stagnating progress also puts at risk hopes of extending global goals to include other eduction targets, says the report, which notes that aid to secondary education also declined by 11% between 2010 and 2011. &quot;If we do not get it right by 2015, how can we get it right after that date, and get not just all children but also all adolescents into school? The energies being rallied to consider what plans and targets should be set for the future of our children must ensure sufficient financing to achieve them.&quot; The final report of the UN high-level panel on post-2015 development proposed a broad goal on quality education and lifelong learning. It suggested targets to increase the proportion of children able to access and complete pre-primary education, and ensure every child not only completes primary education but leaves able to read, write and count. It also recommended targets to ensure every child has access to lower secondary education, and increase the number of young people and adults with the technical and vocational skills needed for work.",

    "text": "As anxiety around high and volatile food prices grows, global hunger is again prominent on the international agenda. Later this month, G20 officials meeting in Mexico City will discuss global action to tackle food price spikes. On Tuesday, French president Franois Hollande said he is trying to persuade world leaders to set up strategic stockpiles of agricultural commodities as a buffer against extreme price swings. In October, the UN is expected to release revised estimates of how many people go to bed hungry each night. The Guardian is currently hosting an exhibition by photographer Gideon Mendel, who visited four schemes run by Concern Worldwide in northern Kenya, where many of the poorest families spend up to 80% of their income on food. This collection of photos helps capture the human dimension of the ongoing battle against hunger. Teso Diba lives in the dusty and barren settlement of Sahgel, around 18 miles from the mountains of Marsabit in northern Kenya. She faces a daily struggle to provide food for her children. Teso and her family are pastoralists who herd livestock and rely on their animals for food and income, but poor rainfall has depleted the herd and the remaining animals are weak and hard to sell. Diba&apos;s four-year-old son is being treated for severe malnutrition in Concern&apos;s outreach nutrition programme. &quot;My son Umuro started losing weight and getting sick, and I knew it was because I didn&apos;t have enough food in the house,&quot; she says. &quot;When Concern arrived at the village, they asked if I wanted to have my children checked and weighed and I was glad someone was seeing him finally. Now he is in the programme he is getting better and stronger, but food has really become a problem for us lately.&quot; Another programme featured in the exhibition aims to combat the effects of drought, one of the toughest problems the pastoralists have to face. A micro-irrigation project in Madowadi, a small settlement in northern Kenya by the Ethiopian border, 430 miles from Nairobi, provides pastoralists with an alternative livelihood. The programme participants are Borana  a pastoral people who have lost most of their animals to drought. The micro-irrigation project has now been running for two years. Before it was set up, people had to cut down trees for wood to use in construction projects, or for charcoal  hazardous work, because it is illegal to cut down the trees for charcoal. They would have to wait, entering the towns and villages when the ministry men were gone, or selling the fruits of their labour on the road outside. The micro-irrigation programme set up by Concern and its local partner, Community Initiative Facilitation and Assistance (Cifa), has helped transform this settlement into an oasis of green in a usually dry landscape, providing the community with new sources of food. There are 30 households in the programme and each has a plot. From dawn to dusk, Jillo Dabassa, one of the programme&apos;s participants, works on her plot. &quot;I was divorced and left with with children, and I had to find a way of making a living,&quot; she says. &quot;I burned charcoal and borrowed money. I was looked down on in the village and no one helped me out. Then Cifa came to my community. They introduced me to farming and gave me training.&quot; Water is pumped from a pan built by Cifa and directed to tiny holes 20cm apart in plastic pipes. Plants are placed exactly where the water drips out, ensuring that the water seeps gently but effectively into the roots. Tomatoes, onions and kale are flourishing. The goal is to protect the community protect against the shock of future droughts, and building resilience is a key aim . Anne O&apos;Mahony, Concern&apos;s country director, says: &quot;The problem that many of the most vulnerable people face is the uncertainty of how they will provide for their families. There are so many factors that are outside of their control. We are working out ways that address their immediate needs but, more importantly, enable people to secure their own stable futures. &quot; The exhibition, Four Stories about Hunger, is on until Thursday 20 September 2012 at the Guardian Gallery, Kings Place, London N1.  Chris Elliott is the Guardian&apos;s readers&apos; editor and a trustee of Concern Worldwide (UK). He travelled with Concern",

    "text": "The Qatari hosts of the UN climate talks and the intransigence of large developed and developing countries were being widely blamed on Friday night for scenes of frustration and confusion as the negotiations dragged on through the evening without outcome. Delegates were due to gather at 7.30am local time on Saturday for a meeting that should have happened more than 12 hours earlier, in a last-ditch attempt to thrash out a deal. Around 1am on Saturday, at a meeting on a part of the text dealing with compensation to poor countries for the damages caused by climate change, there was a row and a negotiator from the Alliance of Small Island States left, apparently in tears. Tempers were fraying in other meetings as tired delegates wrangled over details. China was accused of trying to backslide on agreements made last year, by reinstating text that had been left out by previous agreement. The US was accused of intransigence by poor countries, and of refusing to make commitments on providing finance to them. The Kyoto protocol, still the only international treaty stipulating cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and a touchstone for many environmentalists, had looked on the verge of being rescued by a coalition of rich and poor nations painstakingly assembled over two years. The talks had to be adjourned for several hours because delegates were unable to agree on poorly worded texts. The delay raised the possibility of a breakdown in the talks, and does little to increase faith in the UN climate process. But there was some cause for optimism amid the disagreements, as many countries are reluctant to leave the long-running talks with nothing. Negotiators from rich and poor countries alike were furious at the hosts and there were barely veiled insults even in the open conference sessions. Referring to the latest version of the negotiating text, the Chinese delegate told the hosts: &quot;This meal prepared by you, just like that in the QNCC [conference centre], is not that delicious, but at least it offers us something to eat.&quot; One participant told the Guardian: &quot;It&apos;s like the Qataris think it&apos;s a World Cup, but this is not a game of football  these are serious negotiations about the future of the planet. They have not taken this seriously  they have not got a grip.&quot; Jake Schmidt, international climate policy director at the green campaigning group Natural Resources Defence Capital, said: &quot;There&apos;s a cultural mismatch between the Qatari team and this process. They think deal-making is beneath them. They are not managing very well.&quot; One delegate accused the Qataris of going home early on Thursday instead of working through the night on the draft texts, which hosts are expected to do. At stake is the future of the Kyoto protocol, the main targets of which expire this year. More importantly, this conference was meant to clear the way for a new climate agreement that for the first time would bind both developed and developing countries to carbon cuts. If these talks break down, work on that crucial treaty will be disrupted, which could spell serious trouble, as the deadline for negotiations is already tight. Countries must sign an agreement in 2015 for it to come into force in 2020. This was supposed to be a straightforward meeting, because there is wide agreement on the principle of continuing the Kyoto protocol, albeit with only a few developed countries  EU members, Australia, Norway and a handful of others  agreeing to make emissions cuts. Japan and Canada abandoned the treaty, which they previously strongly supported, last year, and the US has never ratified it. The only other business for the conference was to gain an agreement on developed countries providing financing for poor nations, to help them combat climate change; to adopt a work programme for negotiating the new treaty by 2015; and to sort out some technical issues left over from previous meetings, in order to clear the way for new negotiations to begin. All these looked likely to be achieved in the final days of the talks, and still may be  if the hosts can pull the talks out of the quagmire on Saturday. One of the problems is that, as the UK&apos;s negotiator put it, &quot;nothing is agreed till everything is agreed&quot;. That means that the conference is unlikely to be able to rescue the Kyoto protocol unless the other items of business are also resolved. The Qataris also came under fire for not putting forward their own plans for cutting emissions and providing money for poor countries. It had been hoped that as hosts they might galvanise the region, including Saudi Arabia, into doing more on climate change and using a small slice of their oil wealth to satisfy developing country demands for funds. Qatar, the world&apos;s third biggest exporter of natural gas, is also the world&apos;s biggest per capita emitter of carbon  50 tonnes a year, compared to 17 for the US and 1.4 for India. The country makes the majority of its $170bn annual income from oil and gas. Nick Mabey, chief executive of the green thinktank E3G, echoed the views of many when he said: &quot;We think the level of wealth of Qatar and their responsibility for emissions means that they should be contributing. It would add a lot of momentum to the talks if they made a financial pledge, and would encourage other countries in the region to show solidarity and help countries that are afflicted by the burning of fossil fuels.&quot;",

Nikon D7000 500 mm 1/1600 f/6.3 iso:200     Question: These lovely Chinese mystery birds have recently been removed from a wastebasket taxon. Why is this taxon referred to as a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;? How did these birds get there? Can you identify the taxonomic family for these birds and their species? Response: The larger black-and-white birds with the long, thin, pale blueish legs are pied avocets, Recurvirostra avosetta (family: Recurvirostridae -- avocets and stilts) whilst the smaller mottled brown-and-white birds with the shorter thin yellow legs are common greenshanks, Tringa nebularia (family: Scolopacidae -- snipe, sandpipers, phalaropes, and allies).  In recognition of TwitchEd&apos;s succinct but informative comment about pied avocets, and as a gift to him whilst he is away honeymooning in India, I&apos;ll let him tell you about pied avocets:   These birds are famous as the RSPB&apos;s emblem and are a remarkable conservation story. They came back from the brink of extinction in Britain in the mid-19th century, and recolonised the beaches of East Anglia that were closed during the war. They are elegant wading birds with long upturned beaks that sift invertebrates from the water. Their black and white plumage is not their only striking feature, they also have long blue legs that dangle well behind the tail during flight. The young are quick off the mark after hatching, running and feeding within hours - handy when your nest is just a scrape in the mud. [link].  Common greenshanks are placed into the large family of &quot;typical waders&quot;. The common greenshank&apos;s sister taxa are the spotted redshank, T. erythropus, and the greater yellowlegs, T. melanoleuca. These three species can be distinguished on the basis of location since their ranges have minimal overlap. They can be distinguished also on these bases:  greater yellowlegs is darker with more gray-brown in plumage, has more heavily barred white tail, dark back, and brighter yellow legs. Voices similar   spotted redshank is darker overall with brighter, redder coloured legs, darker straight bill, darker grey-streaked upperparts, dark grey streaks on throat and breast, pale underparts may have a few dark spots. Voices distinct  [See this free PDF to learn how to distinguish spotted redshank from common greenshank].  Formerly, the waders (or shorebirds, as they&apos;re collectively known in the United States) were placed into the suborder Charadrii, but more rigorous DNA studies revealed this was a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot; where at least four charadriiform groups are dumped together into one paraphyletic assemblage that includes some related lineages, whilst overlooking others. We&apos;ve recently confirmed that these shorebird lineages were already present and recognisable at the K-T boundary (CretaceousPaleogene extinction event, which is often referred to as the CretaceousTertiary extinction event, which occurred 65.5 million years ago). So for this reason, the shorebird lineages are now comprised of four taxonomic suborders: Scolopaci; Thinocori; Chionidi and Charadrii.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

    "text": "If you&apos;re a fan of 12-year-old Japanese games, you&apos;ve had a good day so far. Sega has confirmed that it is bringing the Dreamcast hit Sonic Adventure 2 to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in the autumn. There are also whispers of Yakuza 1 and 2 re-releases. Meanwhile, Capcom has announced an updated re-run of its idiosyncratic 2D fighting game, Jojo&apos;s Bizarre Adventure, originally released in the arcades back in 1999. That will be hitting XBLA and PSN in August.  These are just the latest examples in an ongoing and escalating trend. Over the past 12 months we&apos;ve seen HD re-releases for Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, and for Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, Devil May Cry and Zone of the Enders. Often these have tied in smartly with news of forthcoming releases  Silent Hill, Metal Gear and Devil May Cry all have fresh additions coming this year. But in other cases, it&apos;s pure nostalgia  or, worringly, the signs of an emerging business model. Take Sega. In March, the company announced that it would be undergoing a phase of &apos;structural reform&apos;, downsizing its Western operation, shedding jobs and focusing on key brands. Part of this process will also involve concentrating more efforts on the publisher&apos;s cheaper, less risky digital offerings  and while interesting new titles like Hell Yeah will figure, the emphasis is currently on HD remakes: hence, Jet Set Radio and NiGHTS Into Dreams both returning after a decade in the vaults.  There is a growing sense that, in global terms, the Japanese industry has lost its way. Major brands like Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Final Fantasy have failed to compete with behemoths like Call of Duty, Mass Effect and Grand Theft Auto, and innovation has stuttered. In 2009, Japanese game design legend Keiji Inafune controversially claimed that his country&apos;s industry was finished  he was at the Tokyo Game Show, once the bright spot on the gaming calendar, now a half-empty shadow, filled with RPGs and mech battle sims.  At the Develop conference earlier this month, Dewi Tanner  a freelance developer who spent years working in Japan, most notably for NanaOn-Sha, the creator of Pa Rappa the Rapper  gave a fascinating talk on the state of the Japanese games industry. He argued that Japan traditionally performs much better, creatively speaking, when it is leading trends rather than following them. With the arcade market of the eighties and nineties, Japanese companies like Sega and Namco were at the head of the business, setting trends and leading the way with titles like Ridge Racer and Virtua Fighter.  According to Tanner, however, the country struggles when it seeks to reflect or catch up with global trends. Western fads such as vast open-world shooters, seamless driving sims and dark, adult orientated action RPGs, have been more tricky to comprehend because they&apos;re not part of the native gaming DNA. The responses to this have largely failed. Japanese studios attempting to create games that look and feel like Western releases have produced the likes of Resident Evil 5 and Final Fantasy XIII  fatally compromised titles that either mimic Western trends or seek to simplify and iron out local eccentricities.  Other publishers have attempted to farm out key brands to Western developers, infusing their franchises with global appeal. Or that was the idea. What this has resulted in is titles like Bionic Commando  titles no one cares about, whether they live in Japan, the States or Scandinavia.  Currently, then, Japanese mainstream games development is in something of a rut: attempting western-style games in-house doesn&apos;t work, but farming out familiar brands doesn&apos;t always work either (though let&apos;s see how Ninja Theory gets on with Devil May Cry).  A key problem is also in the encouragement of new talent. The major publishers are still dominated by the big name producers and directors we&apos;ve been hearing about for over a decade. According to Tanner, the new generation just isn&apos;t being encouraged. Japan does have a healthy indie scene, but removed from the Western community, its harder for the likes of Dong or Masaaki Hirano to get wider coverage. The worry, of course, is that the Japanese publishers don&apos;t care. Traditional console titles aren&apos;t doing astoundingly well in the country anyway. In 2011, only three releases sold more than a million copies in Japan  a country of 128m people: Mario Kart 7, Super Mario 3D Land and Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. There has, however, been a massive uptake of social mobile games, with platform providers like Gree and DeNA becoming hugely successful by tapping into this exploding preference for casual, highly connected phone titles. Indeed, a huge industry of small studios has grown up, all self-publishing their own titles for native phone operators. The traditional publishers like Konami and Capcom are also heavily involved. When Konami announced its financial results last year, titles like Dragon Collection and Professional Baseball Dream Nine, which run on the Gree and DeNA-run Mobage platforms, were among its biggest earners. Could it be then, that far from going through some protracted period of creative decline, the Japanese games industry is merely switching its focus, away from the global console business and toward the booming native market for social phone games? Sega, Capcom and co have struggled for several years to attune their development studios to Western tastes, with only intermittent successes  they have never really bought into our obsession with gritty realism and graphic brutality. Instead, there is a thriving local user-base with a familiar mindset and huge growth potential.  Perhaps this reliance on HD remakes and farmed out brand extensions isn&apos;t something we should pity Japan and its developers for. Perhaps we&apos;re the ones getting the scraps; we&apos;re the ones living in the past. Perhaps, Japan has motored into its own version of the future, far away from ours.",

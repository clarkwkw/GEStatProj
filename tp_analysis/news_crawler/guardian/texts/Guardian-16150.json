    "text": "GCSE exams in England face a radical overhaul, Michael Gove has said today. Coursework is to be scrapped; A-G grades will disappear, to be replaced with a numerical system, where 8 is the best score and 1 the lowest; and course content will be &quot;more challenging&quot;. But the revised exams will not, contrary to earlier reports, be known as iLevels  instead they will be called GCSE (England), to mark their difference from Wales and Northern Ireland. You can see Gove&apos;s speech to the Commons on our live blog here, and a comprehensive Q&amp;A of the changes being made here. What do you make of the new-look GCSEs? Do you have any concerns as a parent or a teacher, or are the changes welcome? Share your views in the comments thread below.",

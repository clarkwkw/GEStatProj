    "text": "Here is a video from the Sixty Symbols team at Nottingham University (note - not by, or involving, me) on the Pauli/Cox/Carroll controversy that I wrote about here.            Meanwhile, and completely unrelated... You may have seen various announcements on the Higgs from the Tevatron and LHC. My summary... no breakthrough yet, no &quot;eureka&quot; moment. Incremental progress but all subject to large statistical uncertainty. Basically, just as one might expect given the limited data sets. We really need the data we are going to take at the LHC this year to move things on much. Nice work though. Here&apos;s a link to yesterday&apos;s Tevatron summary plot, and the ATLAS results released today. Don&apos;t let the &quot;Higgsteria&quot; (to quote Mark Lancaster) carry you away. This is going to take a while. But it remains one of the most exciting scientific journeys ever.  Are we there yet? No!",

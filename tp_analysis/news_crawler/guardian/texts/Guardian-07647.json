    "headline": "Pollutionwatch: London's ozone level cleared just before Olympic start", 
    "text": "During the week leading up to the Olympic Games, London experienced its worst ozone episode for six years. Fortunately fresh westerly winds began to clear London&apos;s air pollution just before the opening ceremony. On 21 July high pressure moved over the UK and air began to slowly circulate over southern England and the near continent, one of the most densely populated and industrial areas of Europe. Ground-level ozone slowly built up due to the action of sunlight and high temperatures on pollution emitted from vehicles and industry. Ground level ozone peaked in London on 25 July reaching high levels according to the UK air quality index: they exceeded the World Health Organisation Guidelines by around 80% and caused Defra to activate its new pollution alerting system for the first time. Unusually ozone concentrations remained above WHO guidelines for most of the following night. High air pollution also extended over East Anglia and the Sussex coast where onshore breezes led to ground level ozone staying above WHO guidelines for nearly 48 hours. High concentrations of ozone affected Dorset and Northampton on the 26th and extended over Devon on the 27th. Problems with ozone also reached Bristol and north to the Midlands and Manchester. Similar pollution concentrations were measured across northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and parts of Germany.",

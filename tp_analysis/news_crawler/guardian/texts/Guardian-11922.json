    "text": "Microsoft&apos;s Surface (from 399) offers a serious alternative in the tablet market, with its integration of a traditional Windows desktop behind the scenes and the dual cover/keyboard allowing for proper typing on the integrated Office apps. However, while the preloaded Microsoft offerings are largely excellent (including Smartglass, which allows for control of PCs and Xboxes from the tablet), the Windows Store isn&apos;t up to pace yet. Despite Xbox Live integration, games are lacking and there&apos;s no compatibility with Windows Mobile titles. Still, there&apos;s fun to be had. Jetpack Joyride (free, Halfbrick) is a blast of retro entertainment. You steer through a forward-moving jetpack adventure, touching the screen to fire up the eponymous device and control vertical movement, while the usual obstacles are dodged and power-ups gathered. Great Big War Game (1.99, Rubicon) may be familiar to iOS gamers, but it suggests that the Windows Store will soon offer as much choice as the others. It&apos;s an excellent turn-based strategy game, putting you in charge of an army of units  snipers, grunts, tanks etc. It shines in online multiplayer, with asynchronous play  skirmishes can last for as long as it takes, as opponents play whenever they have a spare minute. A sure way to counteract any productivity the Surface&apos;s keyboard has encouraged.",

    "text": "It may be the first day after the Christmas break, but it&apos;s straight down to business for year 11 pupils at Greenshaw high school in Sutton, Surrey, who are doing a mock GCSE English paper. They are sitting in single rows of desks, heads bowed in silent concentration, but this is no typical exam. Teacher Nick House is up at the front, reading out the questions  and explaining how to answer them. &quot;This one&apos;s worth four marks, so make at least five points, just to be safe,&quot; he says, as students painstakingly highlight sections of the text they have been given and write in their exam booklet. Known as a &quot;walking talking mock&quot;, it is a new initiative intended to boost students&apos; exam technique  and ultimately their GCSE grades. The papers will be marked and returned to students within 24 hours (along with an individual set of targets), so when it comes to the &quot;real&quot; exam, later in the week, they will be confident of success. &quot;When they turn up for the exam they will be so believing that they are going to achieve, that&apos;s exactly what they&apos;ll do,&quot; says the school&apos;s headteacher, Will Smith. His confidence is justified: last year, 76% of students achieved five or more GCSEs with A*-C grades  compared with around 35% seven years ago  something he puts down to the school&apos;s involvement in the PiXL club. The club is a group of schools that work collaboratively to improve pupil performance, particularly at GCSE level  with impressive results. Last year, PiXL (which stands for Partners in Excellence) schools  achieved an average increase in GCSE results of 4.6%, compared with a national decline of 0.4%. The schools involved are passionate  evangelical even  about the benefits. According to headteacher John Cornally, PiXL-inspired projects have boosted the number of students getting As and A* at GCSE at his school  Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic college in Altrincham, Cheshire  by 25%. &quot;There is a real family feel [about the club] and a genuine desire for everyone to succeed,&quot; he says. Smith, who is also the deputy director of PiXL, is particularly proud of a motivational programme introduced at Greenshaw last year that helped 25 &quot;borderline&quot; year 11 students (those identified as being at risk of not achieving C grades at GCSE) to achieve the five A*-C GCSE grades needed to progress into the sixth form  and in many cases, beyond that. But despite its considerable  and measurable  successes, the PiXL club attracted unwelcome media attention late last year, after an article in the Times Educational Supplement (TES) claimed the group was urging schools to enter students for both GCSE and the international or iGCSE English examinations to boost their standing in league tables (the latter, more traditional qualification, with a focus on end-of-course exams, was historically favoured by the independent sector and has only counted in the government performance data since 2010). And while the PiXL brand has emerged relatively unscathed  in fact, says its founder Sir John Rowling, 40 more schools have signed up &quot;off the back of the TES piece&quot;  some members have been left feeling stung; particularly by the Department for Education (DfE), which referred to them in a press statement as &quot;cynical&quot;. Rowling, a former headteacher, is still cross about the issue and keen to point out that the group does not &quot;impose anything on anybody&quot;. Around 700 students from PiXL schools sat the iGCSE exam last summer and, given the recent English GCSE debacle  in which thousands of students received lower grades than expected after boundaries were changed between the January and June exam sessions  schools cannot be blamed for seeking alternative qualifications, he says. &quot;It was very distressing to see kids who thought they had passed, who we thought had passed and believe should have passed, and didn&apos;t. We&apos;re not going to get caught with our trousers down again because it was very embarrassing last year.&quot; What is even more galling about the episode, he says, is that entering pupils for additional exams is just one of many strategies used by the group to help pupils achieve exam success. At the heart of the PiXL club is a commitment to high-quality leadership, schools supporting one another and a shared sense of &quot;moral purpose&quot; about giving all young people  regardless of background or ability  the opportunity to achieve their very best. And while Rowling and Cornally enthuse about the &quot;family feel&quot; of the group, and Smith talks about &quot;throwing off the shackles&quot; and not being &quot;constrained by the walls of the school&quot;, the PiXL philosophy is underpinned by rigour. Annual membership costs 3,200 (which, as Smith is quick to point out, makes up a tiny percentage of his school&apos;s 9m annual budget), for which members can attend six conferences a year. They also get access to resources and revision materials, including online tutorials and webinars. Over the Christmas period, 480 children logged on to a series of English revision webinars developed by the group, says Rowling. Member schools are assigned an &quot;associate&quot;  an experienced school leader who helps to identify problem areas (such as particular groups of children not achieving their potential), devise appropriate solutions or interventions and, crucially, measure whether they are working  an approach known within PiXL circles as &quot;diagnosis, therapy, testing&quot;. Sharing good practice with &quot;like-minded&quot; people is another benefit, says Sonette Schwartz, headteacher at Brockhill Park school in Hythe, Kent. &quot;For example, I wanted my head of RE to visit another department, one that was outstanding. I sent out an email, and within the day, had five invitations from five schools  one as far away as Newcastle,&quot; she says. In a time when many are converting to academies  and gaining more autonomy in the process  the notion of schools helping each other to help themselves seems like a good fit. But is there a risk that some of PiXL&apos;s work  such as the &quot;walking talking mock&quot;, for example  could end up focusing more on teaching to the test than giving young people the skills they need for lifelong learning? Smith insists this is not the case. &quot;We&apos;re not spoonfeeding them [students]. What we&apos;re doing is coaching them. This helps to build confidence, which in the long term will help them become more independent learners.&quot; Over the past five years, the group has grown from 40 to nearly 600 members and expanded the breadth of its work to include key stage 3, primary schools, pupil referral units and international schools  proof, says Rowling, that the government got it wrong about the PiXL club. &quot;We&apos;ve been at this game a long time, we are not charlatans who have come out to try and think of ways to trick the government,&quot; says Rowling. &quot;I&apos;m not cynical. Cynical means you are exploiting for your own ends, but we don&apos;t make anyone do anything. We are giving young people a chance that will take them into their future, that they could do quite legitimately and properly without any great pressure. How can that be cynical?&quot;",

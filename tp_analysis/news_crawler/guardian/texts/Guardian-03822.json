    "text": "There are a couple of obvious correlations between Starhawk, Lightbox&apos;s brand new space western third-person shooter on the PS3, and Warhawk, Incognito&apos;s online warzone for Sony&apos;s console back in 2007. Both put a premium on fast-paced, arcade style third-person-shooter action involving land and air vehicles. Both were also developed by roughly the same group of people; when Incognito folded in 2009, a lot of its staff formed Lightbox. Another, perhaps less obvious influence on Starhawk is Tim Schafer&apos;s 2009 love letter to heavy metal, Brutal Legend. Aside from the open-world, vehicle-based exploration element, DoubleFine attempted to blend third-person battler mechanics with a real-time strategy element, which yielded mixed results at the time. Starhawk&apos;s marriage of TPS and RTS is far better implemented. The game&apos;s shooter mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has played a TPS in the last decade. The RTS element  or &quot;Build &apos;n Battle&quot; as it&apos;s tagged here  works an absolute treat. Players hit the triangle button to open a menu and then use a thumbstick to select the structure of their choice. Said structure then rockets onto the battlefield and constructs itself within seconds. The only niggling concern players need bear in mind is whether or not they have the right amount of currency  represented in the game as Rift Energy (RE)  to buy said structure. If they don&apos;t, they simply need to find some enemies and shoot the hell out of them. You know, like you would in any shooter. That isn&apos;t to say that Starhawk is run-of-the-mill. Its multiplayer is a bright, brilliant, chaotic jewel. Players who rack up a decent kill rate  or remain nearby their team&apos;s Rift Energy Extractor (picture an oil well producing bright globs of energy)  can call in fortresses in short order. They can order up interlocking walls, bunkers filled with machine guns and rocket launchers and watchtowers that offer sniper rifles. They can call down AI turrets to blast opposing ground troops or beam lasers to strafe enemies who attack from the air. They can even call in platforms that produce friendly troops, speeder bikes, jetpacks, jeeps with rear gun turrets, tanks and  best of all  the game&apos;s signature vehicle, the Hawk, a two-footed mech that transforms into a starfighter at the touch of a button. Up to 32 people can take part in Starhawk&apos;s online battles, which offer a decent selection of maps and some fairly standard match types  Capture The Flag , Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Zones. On top of that, the menus offer players a whole host of online options including avatar customisation, a match editor, news updates, leaderboards, event calendars, clan news and more. A huge chunk of Starhawk&apos;s interface is taken up by multiplayer options, so it&apos;s pretty clear that Lightbox is placing its online fragfests front and centre as the lifeblood of its shooter. On top of the competitive shooter aspect, Starhawk also boasts a co-op mode in which players have to defend a base against increasingly heavier armed waves of oncoming foes.     Starhawk    It&apos;s true that the co-op is a riff on Gears Of Wars&apos; Horde mode, but Starhawk lends it a rambunctious charm and it remains heaps of fun to play throughout. This focus on the multiplayer unfortunately has a detrimental affect on Starhawk&apos;s single-player campaign, which feels quite undercooked in the story department. In it, players are told that the discovery of a new power source, Rift Energy, prompted an intergalactic gold rush of sorts, with prospectors hurrying off to stake their claims to RE on distant planets. There&apos;s a catch: overexposure to RE turns humans into blood-crazed savages, called Outcasts, who attack prospectors on sight. Players take on the role of a bloke named Emmett, who works as a Rift Salvager, protecting prospectors and their claims. Emmett has also been slightly mutated by his exposure to RE, but the player gains no special abilities from this arrangement. Rather it seems to exist solely as a plot device aimed at making Emmett and his snarky workmate Cutter seem more like loners in a lawless galaxy. Given how tantalising the space western set up for the game&apos;s campaign is, it&apos;s quite disappointing how little Lightbox does with it in terms of the plot. Indeed, as the story unfolds over a six- to eight-hour stretch, it doesn&apos;t contain a single development that will come as any surprise to players. Furthermore, Emmett proves to be a tiresome character to spend too much time with; he&apos;s too stoic, too dour and not much fun to be around. Cutter, his partner, is far better company and his sarcastic, witty asides are one of the single-player mode&apos;s highlights. While its plot may be undernourished, the campaign does contain a series of worthy action set pieces, and really, it&apos;s not a bad way to spend an afternoon. But the single-player&apos;s main purpose seems aimed at familiarising players with Starhawk&apos;s mechanics before setting them loose in the game&apos;s online battleground, which, as has been mentioned, is where its true longevity lies. If you&apos;re a shooter fan looking for a break from the norm and you can look past the undernourished single-player campaign, Starhawk is certainly worth picking up.  Game reviewed on PS3",

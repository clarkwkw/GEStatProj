    "text": "I enjoy a car with a sarcastic name. Like a Mitsubishi Carisma, a vehicle with the charisma of a potato. Or aRover Streetwise, which, despite its attempts to look tough, is clearly a Rover 25 underneath  a cowering, curtain-twitching old granny of a car. OraSuzuki Swift, which isn&apos;t. Isn&apos;t swift, I mean. Nor is a Skoda Rapid rapid. The entry-level, 1.2-litre, three-cylinder petrol-engine model must be spectacularly unrapid. This one I&apos;m trying, the 1.6 diesel, is actuallyperfectly adequate, so long as you don&apos;t expect any thrills. Or frills. That&apos;s what this is  an adequate, honest, sensible, no-nonsense, good-value family motor, aEuropean rival to the cars that come out of Korea. With a very large boot for its size. We took it to Devon for the weekend and it easily swallowed two adults&apos; and one baby&apos;s going-out-of-town paraphernalia (pretty much everything we possess  you never know what you&apos;re not going tofind in the countryside), with room to spare. And it got us there and back safely, and comfortably (though not luxuriously), on a tank of diesel, without damaging the planet too much. And... and that&apos;s about it. The car simply didn&apos;t become a character in the drama of the weekend, in either a good way or bad. It certainly didn&apos;t make much of an emotional impact on my girlfriend. Regular readers of this column (ha!) will know she&apos;s not exactly a petrolhead, but she&apos;ll usually come up with something, at a push. Not this time. I honestly think she didn&apos;t notice it. Spoilt cow, you might think, and you&apos;d be right. But to be fair to her (I&apos;m full of fairness today), it really isn&apos;t very noticeable. It&apos;s a shame because Skodas can be quite interestingly designed (I&apos;m mainly thinking about the likable  unabominable?  Yeti). But this one is instantly forgettable. Go on, you&apos;ve seen the picture, now look away... See? You&apos;ve instantly forgotten what it looks like. Inside it&apos;s the same story: dullsville. Poor Simon, the photographer. He really struggled to find an interesting detail for the little interesting detail picture. It all works and makes sense, but nothing stands out. No one&apos;s going to buy a Skoda Rapid because they&apos;ve fallen in love with it; they&apos;re going to buy it because the numbers make sense. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that, of course. It&apos;s a car for the budget, not for the heart; a means of getting from A to B, without excitement, or joy, or anything else, really. It is in short  and unsarcastically  a Skoda Vapid.

    "text": "In the early hours of Monday morning, Nasa&apos;s Mars rover, Curiosity, will slam into the Martian atmosphere and attempt the most complex landing on an alien world since space exploration began. The $2.5bn mission will explore the huge Gale Crater to answer whether Mars was ever capable of providing a home to life as we know it, had it ever arisen on the planet.  Join us from 6am BST on Monday morning as we live blog the nail-biting descent, and the &quot;seven minutes of terror&quot;, during which the spacecraft must fly through the Martian sky, deploy a parachute, fire retrorockets, and lower the car-sized rover on cables to the ground. Touchdown is due at 6.31am BST.",

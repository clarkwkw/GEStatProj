    "text": "David Cameron has defended the government&apos;s commitment to overseas aid funding at a time of recession, as he prepares to co-host a hunger summit in Downing Street on the closing day of the Olympics. Despite admitting there was &quot;no one single answer&quot; to world hunger, the prime minister on Friday outlined his hopes for the outcomes of the summit of world leaders this Sunday. Co-hosted with Michel Temer, the Brazilian vice-president, where the 2016 Games will take place, the event is designed to show that the Olympic family is aware of the gaping inequalities faced by competitors. It is likely to set a target to reduce the number of children left stunted by malnourishment worldwide by as much as 17 million by 2016. Mo Farah, the Somalian-born British 10000m gold medal winner, is expected to be among a clutch of sports figures to attend. Cameron told ITV1&apos;s Daybreak: &quot;I wanted to do this during the Olympic Games. We are all thinking about the next gold medal, but there are millions of children around the world who are thinking: &apos;Am I going to get the next meal?&apos; &quot;There are 170 million children who are malnourished. In some cases it results in death, but in a lot of cases it results in stunting, it means people don&apos;t reach their full potential and have all sorts of restrictions and illnesses later on in life.&quot; In reference to the government&apos;s overseas aid funding level during a double-dip recession, the prime minister said: &quot;I think most people recognise that when there are 170 million people around the world suffering from malnutrition, when there are millions of people living on less than a dollar a day, even at a tough time in Britain, we are right to meet our aid commitments.&quot; Cameron made his comments on Friday as a petition from aid charities calling for action against global hunger signed by 500,000 was due to be delivered to Downing Street. Although it is not a pledge-making summit in terms of donations, the government regards the summit as a way to provide an international legacy of the Games and to show that Cameron wants to make malnourishment a big issue in the lead-up to the British presidency of the G8 next year. It will be the first time Britain has held the presidency since Tony Blair&apos;s aid-pledging G8 summit in Gleneagles in 2005. The primary goal is to highlight child malnutrition and its resulting physical stunting as the chief area where progress is lacking in the development field. A global target to reduce the number of stunted children by 40%, or 70 million, by 2025 has been agreed by the World Health Assembly. The summit is likely to focus on more short-term targets. On Friday US agriculture department will talk at the summit about how the worst drought in 60 years in the US midwest is pushing up global food prices and increasing hunger in Africa. Wheat prices rose by 19% on international markets in July alone. Andrew Mitchell, the secretary of state for international development, said on Friday that not enough was being done to tackle a problem that saw millions go to bed starving every night. It was an opportune time to galvanise support by putting a &quot;real flag in the sand&quot; about the importance of tackling malnutrition, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. &quot;We&apos;ve made good progress in a number of areas. We&apos;ve made good progress this year on family planning where British leadership will mean that up to half the women who want contraception today but don&apos;t have it will be able to get it,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;But not enough is being done to tackle malnutrition and this is a real chance for Britain and Brazil to say something about galvanising world support in this important area.&quot; Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of the charity Save the Children, said malnutrition was the achilles heel of development. &quot;We just cannot stumble from one food emergency to another. It is not just about how much people eat, but also the nutritional value, as well as breastfeeding. There are techniques to fortify crops, or provide specific products such as fortified biscuits.&quot; He said Cameron should be praised for tackling the problem. &quot;When Britain adopts an issue in the field of aid, the momentum changes. Probably a million lives have been saved since Cameron called the vaccines summit [in June 2011].&quot; Britain has been a supporter of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement since it began in 2010. The charity Oxfam warned ahead of the summit that rising global food prices could pile more pressure on an overstretched humanitarian system, which is already struggling to cope with food crises in the Sahel region of west Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Yemen. A recent multi-country study showed that for every 10% increase in levels of stunting among children, the proportion of children reaching the final year of school dropped by almost 8%. One study in Guatemala showed that improving growth in children aged under two resulted in a 46% increase in adult wages when those children grew up. It is estimated 80% of stunted children live in 24 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In 18 countries more than 45% of children under five are stunted. Forsyth said that while more children survived past their fifth birthday and attended school at the end of the 2000s than a decade before, a rise in acute malnutrition could undermine those unprecedented gains. The Department for International Development claims nutrition-specific initiatives, such as high-energy wheat biscuits, can only reduce global stunting by a third, the remaining two-thirds will need to be tackled through nutrition-sensitive development. This involves adjusting and redesigning programmes across a range of sectors, including agriculture, environmental health and cash transfer programmes, to ensure that they deliver nutritional results.",

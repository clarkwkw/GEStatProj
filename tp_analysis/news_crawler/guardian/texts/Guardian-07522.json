    "text": "Following the government&apos;s announcement in July that it plans to make all research open access by 2014, a heated debate has developed, questioning this radical decision. This comes in the wake of a boycott of the Dutch publisher Elsevier, launching this transformation of the academic world as we know it. As far back as 2004, former Guardian education editor Donald MacLeod described open access as the practice &quot;which would make scientific research freely available on the internet&quot;. Now the question has moved on from whether open access will be introduced to how it should actually be implemented. The option of &apos;gold&apos; open access, which requires the author to pay a publishing fee, is currently advocated by the Finch Report, a report of the Working Group on Expanding Access to Published Research Findings. Paul Ayris, the director of library services at University College London, warns: &quot;The gold solution carries considerable cost implications for universities, who will have to find money from existing budgets to meet the charges involved&quot;. Professor Stephen Caddick, vice-provost for enterprise at UCL, reiterates this, stating that it could lead to less research being made available. Dr Tricia Cusack, Birmingham, raises the question: &quot;Why should academic authors pay anything at all? They should be paid for their articles&quot;. An alternative to the gold model is a strategy known as &apos;green&apos; open access. Ian Sample, Guardian science correspondent, defines this as allowing &quot;researchers to make their papers freely available online after they have been accepted by journals.&quot; Sample goes on to add that &quot;it is likely this would be fatal for publishers and also Britain&apos;s learned societies, which survive through selling journal subscriptions&quot;. Whatever strikes you as the better (or least worst) option, here is a round up of coverage to catch you up on the debate. Links from the Guardian discussing open access in further detail: Free access to British scientific research within two years Radical shakeup of academic publishing will allow papers to be put online and be accessed by universities, firms and individuals Open access plan is no academic spring The decision the UK faces is not about whether access to scientific research should be free. Rather, it is about how this should be accomplished Why panning for gold may be detrimental to open access research The gold model for open access, supported by the UK government, could lead to significant savings - but only if all the policies surrounding research are joined up UK plan for open access to research is a golden opportunity, not a cost Criticism of the government&apos;s open access policy is largely based on an overestimate of the cost to researchers Other useful links from around the web Open access in the news A useful round-up from Cambridge University Library Predictable problems  the UK&apos;s move to open access Kent Anderson blogs about the possible consequences of open access Access approved? The government&apos;s response to the Finch review Spencer Thompson welcomes the commitment to openness in academic research European Union joins UK open-access bid The EC says it is aiming for 60% of all European publicly funded research articles to be open access by 2016. Be careful where you put that paywall Let&apos;s not celebrate the Academic Spring just yet, says Dr Brian Hughes, psychology lecturer at the National University of Ireland What about the authors who can&apos;t pay? Mark Carrigan asks what will happen to authors and early careers researchers who have not yet secured a steady stream of funding and cannot pay the upfront fees required of gold open access. Academic research shouldn&apos;t be made freely available to all Gold may shine brightly but, green is the more attractive option, argues professor Stephen Caddick, vice-provost for enterprise at UCL This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

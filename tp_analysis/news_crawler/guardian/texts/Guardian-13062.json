    "text": "Children don&apos;t usually get to design and undertake research outside their school classrooms. They certainly don&apos;t usually see their findings shaping government policy, or change the way society views an issue of importance to young people, rather than to the adults who typically run the show. The Children&apos;s Research Centre (CRC) run by the Open University turns children&apos;s experience of research - almost exclusively as subjects of academic scrutiny - on its head. Here, they are the ones who initiate and then drive research projects on topics that that they feel are important.  &quot;The CRC enables children and young people to have a research voice in society and to make valuable contributions to knowledge from their insider perspectives,&quot; says its director, professor Mary Kellett. &quot;They receive comprehensive research training and undertake their own research, leading all stages of the process from design to dissemination.&quot; In mobilising and empowering non-academics as young as nine to make their own enquiries into issues that matter to them, the CRC has seen children propel real changes to the way their worlds work. Great Ormond St Hospital has, for instance, changed its practice following work on social isolation for children with Graves disease following a project done by a 10 year old, and cyberbullying research carried out by children hit scores of media outlets and informed the campaigning messages relayed by National Bullying Week.  The model now has an international profile, with a similar centre established in Turkey; the CRC method is also being employed in the seven-country &quot;Children as Researchers in Primary Schools in Europe&quot; project.",

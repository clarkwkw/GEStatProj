    "text": "With its exuberant mix of cartoonish graphics, adolescent humour and preposterous violence, Borderlands was the surprise hit of 2009. But wouldn&apos;t the inevitable sequel just be more of the same politically incorrect shoot-and-loot action? Well, yes it is and thank goodness for that. Borderlands2 has, quite rightly, decided to stick to its guns. It&apos;s just made the guns better (and the gameplay slicker). The single-player game is significantly longer, even without the countless hilarious side missions, and takes place all over the planet Pandora, which now seems to have added glaciers and green fields to its previously unending deserts. Once again, the highlight is the multiplayer. Two people can play on the same split screen, but four (online) players will have the most fun  the fun of a Commando deploying a nuke-launching gun turret; the fun of charging into battle with a bazooka in each hand, as an aptly named Gunzerker; the fun of popping up behind your foes as an Assassin, the game&apos;s new boy. And although some Borderlands veterans may not agree, the fun of being a Siren that isn&apos;t totally invulnerable Roll up. Roll up. It&apos;s all the fun of Borderlands 2. Who wants some?",

    "text": "There is something about rock climbing and mountaineering that entices physicists and engineers. MIT even have a course on &quot;The Physics of Rock Climbing&quot;. A number of famous physicists have made an impression on the climbing community; Henry Way Kendall won the 1990 Nobel Prize for his work on the development of the quark model of particle physics. Simultaneous to carrying out this groundbreaking research, he was pushing the frontiers on California&apos;s Yosemite Valley with its spectacular kilometre-high vertical granite walls. More recently, after working as a professional physicist in Germany, Alex Huber quit to focus on climbing. He undoubtedly became the world&apos;s best all round climber. He and his brother, Thomas, set the speed record for climbing Yosemite&apos;s most famous climb &apos;The Nose&apos; in 2 hours 45 minutes; a climb that would take an experienced climber the best part of 3 days to climb! Alex has also summited a number of formidable 8000+ metre mountains in the Himalaya. Although the Mountaineering Club of University College London Union isn&apos;t conquering the world&apos;s highest mountains or accomplishing multi-day epics just yet, physicists and engineers are certainly over-represented amongst the membership. So what is it about mountaineering and rock climbing that attracts such large numbers of individuals from these fields? Is it the thrill of being hundreds of meters up a sheer cliff? Or the satisfaction of accomplishing a really hard climb? This sure does it for me, but there is more to it than this. Whether it is the problem solving nature of climbing or just playing with all the safety equipment, physics and climbing is a match made in heaven. Whenever and whatever you climb, your always thinking about the physics of what if I fall, whether you are aware of it or not. How high are you off the floor? How strong is the last piece of gear you placed? In fact the one thing to bring a look of fear to any climber&apos;s face, after rain clouds, has to be the phrase &apos;fall factor 2&apos;. Fall factor is a measure of how big a climbing fall is. To be precise it is the ratio of distance fallen divided by the length of rope available to absorb the fall. This fall factor is what determines how much force is placed on the rope and accompanying gear. With normal single pitch climbing, people rarely generate large fall factors. They are perhaps around 0.2 or smaller, and this sort of fall may produce 3-4kN of force. But on a multi-pitch you can have the potential case where the first climber advances and falls before they can place a piece of gear into the rock. They would then fall down past their belayer (partner giving and taking rope) and the same distance again; this would be a fall factor 2. Such falls can produce tremendous amounts of force even though the total distance fallen can be relatively small, it is falls like this that can snap ropes and yank bolts or gear out of the rock  some of the worst case scenarios for climbers.  Climbing rope is an amazing piece of material science; 60m long yet only 10mm thick, light and flexible enough to pack in a rucksack. My rope has categorically saved my life many times but however hard I try to prolong its lifetime, my rope goes through hell. If it is not catching 75kg of annoyed climber repeatedly falling off a route, it is being dragged through some muddy puddle in North Wales, freezing at -20C up In the Alps or bathed in heat and UV in the southern Spanish sun. One of the most interesting things about climbing rope is that it&apos;s designed to break a little bit every time you take a fall on it, hence the dislike of fall factor 2. This is because the rope needs to be dynamic and have some spring in it to slowly absorb the energy released when you fall. If this energy were not absorbed, your rope may stop you hitting the floor but it would feel like a car crash when it caught you. Now climbing ropes are becoming increasing thin and light; under 9mm thick and 50 grams per meter. The climbing hardware such as the karabiners and harnesses are being made lighter too, shaving off the grams with improved metal alloys. Today climbing is a relatively safe sport, but spare a thought for the early days of mountaineering when the equipment was homemade and before climbing shoes where even invented. There is no doubt that rock climbing appeals to the thrill seekers and adrenaline junkies out there, but for those with knowledge of physics, climbing offers something special. You are constantly aware of the forces acting upon yourself as you ascend a route and when you take a fall. Climbing a route is just solving the vertical problem in front of you, it&apos;s all to do with the sequence of moves and deciphering the rocks line of weakness to exploit. Playing with fancy new gear and hardware appeals to my engineering eye, and my love rock climbing is intertwined with my physicist&apos;s view of the world.",

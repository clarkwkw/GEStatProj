    "text": "  When Dan Kirby graduated with a first-class maths degree, choosing a career was not difficult. He had always enjoyed maths at school and knew he wanted to pass on his enthusiasm to others. &quot;I did a placement with an actuarial firm in Leeds during my degree. It was a great company, but I just didn&apos;t find the idea of sitting in front of a spreadsheet from nine to five very exciting,&quot; he says. Turning his back on the financial sector, he enrolled on a one-year postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) course at Oxford University, where much of his training was school-based, and gave up clock-watching. Once qualified, he had a choice of jobs. He picked The Cooper School in Bicester and was recently voted the most passionate teacher there by year-11 students. According to the campaigning charity National Numeracy, people&apos;s negative attitudes to maths are formed in school and stem from teachers&apos; inability to inspire passion for their subject. Maths teachers are in short supply. This year, with a 2:2 degree required, applications for maths PGCEs are down 10% according to the Graduate Teacher Training Registry. Professor John Howson, director of DataforEducation.info and a former government adviser on teacher supply, estimates there are 1.6 applications to fill every maths vacancy in schools, a fifth of the applicants for arts and humanities subjects. Quite simply, the pool of postgraduate mathematicians is shrinking. That pressure works through to schools, with maths vacancies often the hardest to fill. Joan McVittie, head of Woodside High School in north London, one of the Department of Education&apos;s top &quot;improved&quot; schools, is losing four outstanding maths teachers, three of them going overseas. Replacing them is difficult. She says some applicants lack a decent maths qualification and some don&apos;t have the communication skills: &quot;I&apos;ve interviewed a number of candidates whom I just wouldn&apos;t put in front of the children.&quot; There have been moves to ease the situation. Teach First, the charity set up in 2002 to bring top graduates into the toughest schools, points out that under-achievement among pupils from poor homes is far greater in maths than other subjects. Of the 1,332 teachers trained by Teach First over the past two years, nearly a quarter are maths specialists. Bursaries of 20,000 are now available for trainee maths teachers with first-class degrees and the Graduate Teacher Programme, an alternative to the PGCE, offers paid training on the job. The future for maths Anne Watson, professor of mathematics education at Oxford University, recognises the dilemma of broadening the appeal of maths teaching while maintaining its intellectual rigour. She receives many applications from people without the necessary academic background in maths. &quot;You&apos;ve got to understand the subject and have a breadth of knowledge to be able to teach it well,&quot; she says. &quot;We&apos;re looking for people with a creative approach to maths, who&apos;re not just test-driven.&quot; But maths remains an unpopular subject for many pupils. Despite recent increases, still fewer than 20% of young people continue with maths beyond 16, lower than in many other countries. The market, however, may eventually provide its own solution, as it did temporarily when the collapse of Lehman Brothers made teaching suddenly seem a safer bet for maths graduates. John Howson thinks that as schools become free to fix salaries we may see the start of a bidding war in shortage subjects. But for Dan Kirby, the reward is already there. &quot;It&apos;s a difficult job,&quot; he says, &quot;but if you have a bad day, you come back and try something different the next day. It&apos;s all about understanding the way the kidsthink.&quot;",

    "text": "For students who&apos;ve just graduated, how to approach the jobs market can be a daunting prospect no matter how many careers sessions they&apos;ve been to or how assiduous they&apos;ve been at sending carefully crafted applications to relevant employers.  To help students take that first crucial step of their career, rather than just take the first job they&apos;re offered, the University of Dundee has instigated a six-week intensive taught course that builds skills in self-awareness, how to solicit and create opportunities, and how to understand the commercial requirements of the sector they&apos;re trying to break into.  Students can choose to take options including leadership and negotiation and get to practise their interview technique with personalised appraisal and feedback from a team of careers advisers. This is backed up with a six month appraised internship with a Scottish employer.  Feedback from employers has been enthusiastic, with all but one graduate - who secured a job elsewhere - being retained from this year&apos;s cohort.  &quot;We are particularly proud of helping two graduates with 2:2 degrees gain entry onto the graduate training schemes of their placement providers, who normally only accept a 2:1 or above,&quot; says Graham Nicholson, Dundee&apos;s deputy director of student services. Graduates pay to enroll on the module, which is unique in the UK and attracts students from universities across the UK and EU. This year, it will be renamed the Global Internship Graduate Certificate, offering internships in Delhi as well as in Scotland.",

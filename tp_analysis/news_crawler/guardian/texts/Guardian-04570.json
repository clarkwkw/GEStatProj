    "text": "John Bunyan is said to have had south country hills in mind when he described the Delectable Mountains in Pilgrim&apos;s Progress. But Lakeland fells could have been his model recently during hours of radiant sunshine with the skylines sharp and clear and a stiff breeze ruffling the surface of the lakes. Gardens, woods and orchards were there, although vineyards and fountains were rather scarcer to find. Shepherds too were aplenty, snipping individual marks to the ears of an unusual plethora of twins born this lambing time. Twin lambs need to stay longer in the valleys while their mothers gain sustenance from the better grass, so they can yield the extra milk needed. For an enterprising couple of outdoor instructors, who run an adventure centre by Wastwater, it is vintage Bunyan land. This was not just because the &quot;delectable&quot; prospect of Yewbarrow, Kirk Fell, Great Gable, Lingmell and the Scafells soaring high beyond the gleaming lake enhanced the experience for their students. Rather, it was because the crags were snuff-dry for scaling on the safety of the rope, the water of England&apos;s deepest lake was on occasion so clear below the canoe gunwales it offered views like looking into a coral sea. These challenges tested outdoor students in the way the pilgrims Christian and Hopeful were challenged in Bunyan&apos;s account. Each had their individual Giant Despairs or Doubting Castles with pitfalls awaiting any failure. Though, when new arrivals to the great outdoors in wildest Cumbria tackled the obstacles, they found they were less dreadful than they feared.",

    "text": "Microsoft Studios&apos; creative director Adam Orth found himself at the business end of an online lynch mob after using Twitter to announce that the next Xbox would require &quot;always-on&quot; Internet access to work. Coming mere weeks after Electronic Arts&apos; always-on Sim City debacle, which left many paying customers unable to play the game, his comments were pitched somewhere between arrogance and hubris. Twitter&apos;s hive mind brought him to book, to which he responded &quot;#DealWithIt&quot;, prompting an official apology from Microsoft ... Games out this week include Jewel Quest IV Heritage (3DS), a four-year-old PC game repackaged for handheld with some bolted-on 3D frippery, adding nothing of note to the classic gameplay for which the series is famed; and Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst (DS), an even creakier and more venerable hidden-object-finding remake.",

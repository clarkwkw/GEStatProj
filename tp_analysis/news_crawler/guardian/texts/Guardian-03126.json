Well, today is one of those days where I am sharing this particular mystery bird because I never get tired of looking at this species. Can you identify this Central American mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Is this a male or female? Response: This is an adult blue-grey tanager, Thraupis episcopus, a lovely medium-sized songbird in the tanager (Thraupidae) family. These birds are common and widespread residents, ranging from Mexico to northeastern Bolivia, northern Brazil, and throughout nearly all of the Amazon Basin [map]. This species was introduced to Lima, Peru.  Adults have a light bluish-grey head and underparts, darker bluish-grey upperparts, and the bend of the wing shows yet a different (more intense) hue of blue. The eye is black and the bluish-grey bill is short and thick. Males and females look the same whilst immature birds are duller. There are 13-15 subspecies recognised, which are identified primarily by of the hue of blue on the bend of their wing, the rump patch and the body plumage. These birds are gregarious, occurring in noisy pairs or groups. They often form mixed flocks with their close relative, the palm tanager, T. palmarum. Blue-grey tanagers are permanent residents in lowlands, living and breeding in open woodland, cultivated areas and gardens, and they are quite tolerant of humans. Like many of their relatives, they feed mainly on soft fruits, such as ripe mango or papaya, but they also consume nectar and insects, which they may catch in mid-air, similar to flycatchers.  Here&apos;s a short video of a wild pair of blue-grey tanagers feeding on a banana plant in Costa Rica:             [video link].  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

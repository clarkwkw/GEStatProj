    "text": "The case made by Caroline Spelman (Britain is rising to the challenge of greening our economy, is woefully inadequate. We urgently need to redefine the way we measure economic growth. Green conservatism as mediated by George Osborne sees the natural environment as detached from the wider economy, when it underpins it. Natural capital must be conserved or transformed into other forms of capital  social, intellectual or physical  if we are to achieve economic growth that is genuinely sustainable. Rio+20 next month is an opportunity to redefine the model of economic growth for a century where the global population reaches 10 billion. I would encourage Mrs Spelman to read her own department&apos;s natural environment white paper before she boards the plane to Rio. It includes a commitment to embed the value of natural capital into the government&apos;s accounting framework. She needs to encourage other governments to adopt this approach; but she can only do so if she understands it herself.Barry Gardiner MPEd Miliband&apos;s special envoy on climate change and the environment",

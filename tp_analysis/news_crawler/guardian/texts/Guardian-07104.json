    "text": "Leading casual game developer Popcap has created a new app for fans of its hit tower defence title, Plants vs Zombies. Due out later this year on iOS devices, Zombatar will allow players to build their own 3D zombie characters  choosing each monster&apos;s trousers, shirts, hair and shoes  as well as a series of facial features and dance moves. Users can then interact with the creatures, pointing at the screen to get them to pull off a range of jerking responses.  Completing the package, players can choose to add 3D zombies to their own photos or videos  any snaps can be enhanced with small animated zombies superimposed over backgrounds. Images will then be available to download to computer or to share over social networks. Cleverly, Zombatar will also allow users to communicate with their zombie lessors. A speech recognition feature lets fans shout commands at their onscreen dead, only to hear responses being fired back by the rotting charges. It&apos;s an amusing little diversion, clearly aimed at fans who didn&apos;t want their zombie fiction curtailed by the stifling demands of the original story. It&apos;s not a game as such  more an extension of the zombie customisation elements in previous tittles. However, the sheer range of T-shirts, jackets, hats and shoes (with more available to those willing top pay via micro-transactions) will no doubt seduce fans.     Zombatar in action    Popcap has also confirmed that its latest casual gaming phenomenon, Solitaire Blitz, is coming to iOS devices later this year. The card game derivative will be compatible with iPhones and iPad, and cross-platform functionality will allow players to take part on PC or Mac, as well as smartphone. The touchscreen interface works well, especially as the card-sliding element speeds up to meet the increasing competence of the player. So, an app that allows you to superimpose zombies on your photos and an artful translation of Solitaire to iOS. This might not be the announcement bomb that some wanted from this week&apos;s Casual Connect conference in pop cap&apos;s home town of Seattle, but these are neat additions to the Popcap catalogue, and they&apos;ll do until the company finally reveals what its workers have really been beavering away on for the past 18 months.",

    "text": "The announcement of Assassin&apos;s Creed 4: Black Flag was rendered a bit less exciting by the sort of comprehensive leaks now familiar to gamers, though many are still optimistic about its theme of Caribbean piracy, featuring real historical detail along with the usual conspiracy hokum. It&apos;s due for release this autumn. Out now are Tomb Raider (Xbox, PS3, PC), Lara Croft&apos;s gritty reboot that comes with raucous action and some very elegantly designed physical puzzles in its dusty tombs; Starcraft II: Heart Of The Swarm (PC/Mac) expands Blizzard Entertainment&apos;s realtime strategy game with more single-player story and new units for multiplayer; Sim City (PC) gives would-be mayors the opportunity to connect multiple towns, sharing power and air pollution; and Total War: Shogun 2 Gold Edition (PC) brings together all the expansions and downloadable content for this great war game.",

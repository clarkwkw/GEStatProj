    "text": "On Tuesday, it was hurdles; today, it&apos;s hoops. Yes, Google has given over its Olympic doodle to another mini-game this morning. This time, visitors to the Google homepage get to lob basketballs through a hoop by pressing the space bar. It&apos;s a slightly more demanding simulation than yesterday&apos;s, and it took me a few goes to get the feel of it. You hit the bar once to prepare the shot, then again to launch the ball, and the timing between the two strokes denotes the power. As the seconds tick down, your player moves further from the basket, so you&apos;ll need to minutely adjust your tapping speed  if you&apos;re skilful enough you&apos;ll be able to get in a couple of three pointers before the clock runs down. While the hurdles game was clearly inspired by eighties coin-ops such as Hypersports, today&apos;s challenge is much more similar to all those smartphone titles where you lob crumpled pieces of paper into a bin (check out Paper Toss if you haven&apos;t already  that&apos;ll be the rest of the day wasted). Anyway, I&apos;ve just sunk 27, so that&apos;s the one to beat. Add your scores in the comments section below.",

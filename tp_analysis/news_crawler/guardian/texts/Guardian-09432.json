    "text": "Unfortunately it&apos;s just not possible to juggle the drama society with ju-jitsu, the student paper and football. After joining far too many groups at freshers fair, most first-year students will now be culling their student society commitments. And for many, subject-based societies will be the first to go. If you&apos;re studying a maths BA, why bother signing up to maths society? You&apos;ll be doing a fair bit of academic study already, you don&apos;t want to come across as too nerdy. Actually, after spending a year heading my university&apos;s psychology society, and studying the subject full-time at undergraduate level, I found that subject-based societies are the most underrated of all. Here&apos;s why. 1. Most people at university are committed to their subject and want to pursue it further  or, they are until the first essay crises kick in, anyway. Subject-based societies are a great way to meet people who share your interest and reawaken the enthusiasm you had for your field in the pre-Ucas days. 2. Your society will be there for the lows as well as the highs. Bond over your mutual sense of desperation when faced with end-of-term exams. They offer a chance to share your suffering. 3. Membership doesn&apos;t come with the same time commitments as a sports club. You can go to the events you want to but don&apos;t have to worry about letting the side down when life gets too hectic.  4. It&apos;s all in aid of your degree, so any time you do spend there is guilt-free  although, admittedly, free cocktails mean conversations don&apos;t always centre around coursework. 5. Most groups also put on talks featuring big-name academics. Unlike your usual lecturers they don&apos;t demand your attention at 9am after a big night out  and their talks usually veer outside the mainstream topics you cover on your course syllabus. The psychology of face transplantation certainly wasn&apos;t something I was expecting to pop up in my part-finals, but it was refreshing to be able to enjoy a talk on the subject without the pressure of having to learn every detail mentioned. 6. But, events aren&apos;t just for those who hope to pursue their subject beyond undergraduate level. Most societies also put on events to show the range of career options that are available to members after graduation. The society I attend has had plenty of sessions discussing the typical career choices followed by psychologists, but it has also hosted more unusual sessions, including a seminar in science writing. If you haven&apos;t found a society for your subject at university, then why not start one up? Take your academic interests outside the lecture hall, build your own curriculum and make friends.

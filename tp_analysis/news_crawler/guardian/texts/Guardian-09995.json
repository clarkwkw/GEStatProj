    "text": "Seumas Milne (31 October) condemns the obscene and ever-growing wealth of the richest people in the UK and how they and global corporations have avoided paying taxes estimated to be greater than the entire national debt. A few pages later, Alison Benjamin asks &quot;who should pick up the bill for our green spaces?&quot;. Why not let the public decide? Over the last 20 years we have seen the rapid growth of over 5,000 local friends of parks groups committed to rescuing our urban green spaces from the scandalous decline they were plunged into by public spending cuts in the 1980s. Despite this rescue act still not having been completed for most of the 30,000 such spaces, our parks are facing a national funding crisis yet again. As everyone knows, urban parks, despite being a non-statutory service, are a priceless environmental and social resource for every community, and are the most well-used and popular of all our vital public services, on a par with the NHS. It is unacceptable that they should be starved of the staffing, maintenance and management they need. However, there are real differences between now and the 1980s. First, we now know the disastrous problems caused by underfunding and neglect, and the huge cost and effort it takes to turn it back round. Second, we now have a popular, grassroots movement which is going to speak out and demand effective action. Let&apos;s all ensure there&apos;s an active and vociferous group for every green space. We call for adequate funding for all UK parks and a statutory duty to manage them to high standards.Dave MorrisCampaigns officer, National Federation of Parks and Green Spaces",

    "text": "UK foreign aid has been in the news recently, with international development secretary Justine Greening promising increased scrutiny of the Department for International Development&apos;s (DfID) spending record, and debate about the growing aid budget. Attention has also focused on UK aid to the Rwandan government, which is allegedly supporting rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to British development funding through the EU, some of which has been spent on relatively wealthy countries. Much of the drama hinges on questions of who does  and who should  benefit from the ringfenced British aid budget. Is it right that millions of pounds of aid are spent through a small group of, primarily British, consultants? How should DfID work with governments that have weak human rights records? Should it focus on the poorest countries or the poorest people (who predominantly live in middle-income countries)? This scrutiny of UK aid has revived old debates. In the 1990s, the Pergau dam scandal  UK aid for the hydroelectric project in Malaysia was linked to a major arms deal  raised questions about who was benefiting from UK funds. Ten years ago, the 2002 International Development Act legislated that UK aid focus explicitly on reducing poverty and be delinked from trade, commercial or other political goals. DfID, meanwhile, is only 15 years old: previously aid was managed by the Foreign Office. We&apos;ll be discussing these issues and more in October&apos;s Global development podcast, looking at the politics of UK aid, how it&apos;s changed over the past two decades and what will be the coalition government&apos;s legacy to the aid programme. As always, we want your comments to be part of the conversation, chaired this month by the Guardian&apos;s diary editor and Politics Weekly presenter Hugh Muir. We&apos;ll hear from guests including the World Development Movement director Deborah Doane, Overseas Development Institute research fellow Jonathan Glennie and Owen Barder, director of the Centre for Global Development Europe. We will update this post as others are confirmed. If you want to get a feel for the issues, Mark Tran wrote an explainer on the politics of UK aid and we&apos;ve compiled a list of key datasets, including details on who&apos;s winning DfID contracts. Last month, Christian Aid&apos;s Sol Oyela argued that Greening should develop a credible DfID exit strategy from aid, saying its &quot;policy must be driven by the principle that our aid should not be needed any more&quot;. Glennie has discussed former development secretary Andrew Mitchell&apos;s record and the Labour party&apos;s approach to development. Last year, we focused on the relationship between the UK&apos;s development programme and the government&apos;s foreign policy objectives in a Global development podcast presented by Madeleine Bunting. Let us know what you think. We&apos;re recording the podcast on Wednesday 24 October, and want to incorporate your views. What do you see as the key questions? What issues should we focus on? And what would you like to know about the British aid programme? Post your comments below. As always, we&apos;ll put a selection of your thoughts and questions to the panel. If you have any problems posting a comment, or if you would prefer to suggest a question anonymously, email us at development@guardian.co.uk and we&apos;ll add your views to the thread.",

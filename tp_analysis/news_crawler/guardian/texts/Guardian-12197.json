    "text": "Imagine the uproar if the Church of England announced that they were in debt and putting Canterbury Cathedral up for sale. &quot;It&apos;s OK,&quot; the Archbishop would say, &quot;we&apos;ll still take the Church to the people who need it, it&apos;s only a building. We can just move. Maybe somewhere a bit more modern, where the upkeep isn&apos;t so pricey. Or maybe just hold services in the pub every couple of weeks? People like pubs  &quot; The kerfuffle would be unimaginable, the press would be appalled. There would be columns dedicated to losing our heritage. You can touch the walls and feel the vibration of history running through your fingers. You sit down on a pew and feel the wood that thousands of bottoms have touched before. For Christians and many others, the building means something. In the past year, a building has had much that effect on me, though in a more secular way. That building houses The Royal Institution, and last Friday an announcement was made that they were being forced to consider selling up to pay their debts. There has been uproar on Twitter, campaigns begun, letters to The Times from former Christmas Lecturers, and even a petition  to the government to save it for the nation. Yesterday Martin Robbins made a persuasive argument that the bricks and mortar of the Royal Institution shouldn&apos;t matter, that modern outreach is all about grassroots events, and I&apos;ve seen a few voices echo agreement. But while I agree that science should be everywhere (indeed I said so myself in a blogpost 10 days ago), I still think The Ri would be bereft without its old home. I remember the first time I walked into the Faraday Lecture Theatre, in December 2011, to attend a charity night hosted by Robin Ince. I left at the end of the evening on a complete high, although that might have been something to do with the ether soaked cotton wool balls that UCL&apos;s Prof Andrea Sella left in front of me for two hours. I&apos;ve been back many times since. In fact, I blame the Royal Institution for several things, one of which is my enrolling to do a science degree. I even confess to sitting on the massive wooden desk in the deserted lecture theatre, pretending I was Carl Sagan and wondering what it would have been like to be at his Christmas Lectures. And it&apos;s not just the lecture theatre. I&apos;ve spent many happy hours roaming the corridors, poking my nose past doors left ajar, pulling books from shelves in deserted libraries. At the Royal Institution, I can do all that. It took me quite a long time to realise that nobody would question me for my imposition. That&apos;s because, somewhat uniquely, it&apos;s meant exactly for people like me. Me, a working class woman, without a degree, in a poorly paid job, with two kids. And I&apos;m sorry to say, but there are massive areas of science outreach that simply don&apos;t &quot;reach&quot; people like me at all. I can&apos;t always make those pub nights and pop-up events, and I can&apos;t afford a babysitter.  The Royal Institution has a sense of permanence. It soaks me in science at my own time and pace. It&apos;s always there when I have the time for it, not like that once-a-month sci comedy night in the pub that I can&apos;t make because my kid&apos;s ill. And it&apos;s not only there for social events. You can wrap yourself in solitude and silence in its corridors and side rooms, with barely the bang of a distant door for company. I&apos;m an introvert, I don&apos;t always want my sense of wonder at science to be accompanied by masses of people and beer (though I can have that too at the Ri if I choose).  Alom Shaha recently made an argument for a form of church for atheists, and while his emphasis was on the sense of community I also think atheists can appreciate a place to be quiet and think. The Royal Institution is my personal thinking place, and the fact that my hero Michael Faraday used to think there before me is a bonus. The Ri is a welcoming place. There are no stipulations to becoming a member beyond the annual fee so if, as Martin says, it&apos;s primarily &quot;rich old white establishment&quot; then it&apos;s up to people like you and me to change that. I&apos;m making a start, I joined last week, and I agree with Michael Brooks in The New Statesman that diversity would be fundamental to a new pathway. The building and contents combined create cohesion, and a sense of history that could not be conveyed if separated from each other. Yes, you could take Faraday&apos;s laboratory in the basement and recreate it at The Science Museum, but to me there is little sadder sight than Stephenson&apos;s Rocket on a plinth surrounded by white walls, when it should be in a railway yard somewhere in its wonderful dirty, oily context. If I saw Faraday&apos;s big wooden desk behind a velvet rope, I&apos;d be so sad I think I&apos;d never want to see it again. Objects mean something, but they mean even more when they&apos;re in the place they were invented at or intended for. Just ask any proponent of returning the Elgin Marbles, or the museums who &quot;save artworks for the nation&quot;. I agree with Martin that the government should not be our first call to save Albemarle Street. I would be looking to the Heritage Lottery Fund or the National Trust, or even its most natural partner, The Wellcome Trust. I also agree with Martin completely that the vision of the Ri needs a massive rethink. The bland, soulless bar and dining area were a horrible mistake. I would happily see them replaced by a hands-on area full of Archimedes screws and interesting contraptions (with &quot;adults only&quot; evenings because let&apos;s face it, the fun stuff like that is dominated by the under 10s).  But it&apos;s beyond the cosmetic, too. The Ri needs to consider the best way to put the building to use when it has such excellent outreach through its website, Twitter account and video channel.  I can love Showoffs and Skeptics events, I can get grubby and have fun in the grassroots and buy the speakers a beer after (I&apos;ve done that at the Ri too)  But yes, I am firmly behind the campaign to save Albemarle Street.  Sometimes, buildings matter. They mean something. Just ask anyone who belongs to English Heritage or the National Trust. To anyone with a passion for science, the Royal Institution should mean as much as any artwork or stately home. Not just its mission statement or outreach programmes. Bricks, mortar and all.

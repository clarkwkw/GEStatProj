    "text": "The coalition made &quot;a very bad mistake&quot; when it abolished the education maintenance allowance (EMA) in England aimed at helping poorer 16- to 17-year-olds stay on at school, Alan Milburn, the government&apos;s adviser on child poverty and social mobility, tells the Guardian today. Before publication of his controversial report into improving access to higher education, Milburn also warns that there is no evidence that money being spent on tuition fee waivers designed to help low-income students at university is &quot;in any way&quot; effective. Universities run various waiver schemes but students might have their first year of university paid for by the state if they had been eligible for free school meals. Milburn instead calls for much of the fee waivers money  the budget is due to rise from 94m this year to 261m in 2015/16  to be transferred to restoring a revised form of the EMA, scrapped in 2010. The suggestion is part of a wider assessment of how the government and universities spend nearly 600m to help children from poorer backgrounds attend higher education. Universities are estimated to spend as much as 81m on outreach. Milburn will call on them to standardise the way in which they measure the social deprivation of a school student applying for a university place, saying institutions use too many variables, ranging from family income, deprivation of neighbourhood or number of children on free school meals. He will also urge universities to do more to take into account how well a student is likely to do at university. &quot;Students should not be admitted according to how well they did at school, but how well they are likely to do at university,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not a reward for achievement, but a reward for potential to achieve.&quot; Numerous studies showed students from poorer backgrounds did as well or better at university than those from wealthier backgrounds with equivalent A-levels, he said. Milburn will also discuss the impact of the trebling of tuition fees, but will not call for the increase to be reversed. EMA was abolished by Michael Gove on the grounds that it was badly targeted and went to too many children who would have stayed on at school anyway. It was worth 30 a week for those whose household income is under 20,817. Its abolition prompted widespread protests alongside student demonstrations over the rise in tuition fees. Milburn will report that EMA was &quot;generally regarded by universities as an initiative that encouraged progression, attainment and good study habits because of the way it was awarded. &quot;Equally, teachers have expressed concern that EMA acted as a clear incentive for young people to stay on in education, and fear that its removal may have a damaging impact. Independent evaluations also found that it significantly increased staying-on rates and attainment.&quot; He also points out that when the Institute for Fiscal Studies looked into EMA, it found that it had significantly increased participation rates in post-16 education among young adults. It increased the proportion of eligible 16-year-olds staying in education from 65% to 69%, and of eligible 17-year-olds from 54% to 61%. Milburn criticises the government&apos;s alternative to the EMA, saying the bursary scheme is flawed since students have to apply for the bursary after enrolment. &quot;As a consequence students do not know, when applying for a place in post-16 education, whether they will receive a bursary  and if so, what its value will be.&quot; The replacement, called the 16-19 bursary scheme, is worth 1,200 a year and goes only to the 12,000 poorest or most vulnerable students. Milburn says: &quot;Research into those in receipt of the new bursary fund has found that, while it is too soon to quantify the long-term impact on student numbers, many young people are not receiving the financial backup they need to support their everyday living expenses.&quot; His report concludes: &quot;In summary, there is legitimate cause for concern that these changes may have a negative impact on widening participation.&quot; In the meantime, Milburn suggests that the government should increase the funding level and refine the targeting. He also proposes universities should consider providing EMA-style financial incentives directly for young people to stay on and succeed at school. He argues that the best way to increase social mobility is to increase the number of young people staying on at school to achieve good A-levels, and says universities have a role in securing this aim. He said: &quot;It&apos;s not acceptable for universities to say &apos;it&apos;s nothing to do with me guv, and it&apos;s all down to schools&apos;.&quot; The chances of a child who is eligible for free school meals getting good qualifications at age 16 are just over half those for better-off classmates: only about one-third of children eligible for free meals get five good GCSEs compared with about two-thirds of other children. This is reflected in the post-16 attainment gap, where 32% of pupils who were eligible for free meals at age 15 attain level 3 qualifications by age 19, compared with 57% of those who were not. Milburn quoted a Sutton Trust study showing that at highly selective universities, students from private schools are 22 times more likely to get a place than state school pupils eligible for free school meals. &quot;In 28 of the 88 universities in the Sutton Trust report, those who had been eligible for free school meals at age 15 formed less than 3% of their intake. Pupils eligible for free school meals at age 15 made up more than 10% of the intake at only 15 of the 88 universities.&quot; He wants the government to set a long-term objective for spending on higher education to reach the OECD average of 1.5 % of GDP.",

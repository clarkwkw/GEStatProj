    "text": "Wii owners have been starved of decent content recently, so the arrival of such a fine and absorbing RPG as TheLast Story is to be heartily welcomed. Taking place on the quasi-European island Lazuli, the game follows young mercenary Zael through a fairly typical anime-inspired adventure. No real points for originality, but the game shines none the less. Directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, it has the air of a creator freed to experiment in ways hewasn&apos;t able to in his Final Fantasy days.Zael and his allies engage in real-time battles, guarding and parryingenemy attacks in a rejection ofthe expected structure of Japanese role-players. It&apos;s actually rather simplistic yet surprisingly engaging, with strategy elements adding depth tothe action. The Last Story looks and sounds a treat, too, and in offering a lengthy and engrossing quest, this is likely to be one of the last great Wii games.",

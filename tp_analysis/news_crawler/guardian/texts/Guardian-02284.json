    "text": "And lo, Oliver Letwin&apos;s scythe swept through the &quot;red tape&quot; of environmental regulations. As I revealed on Friday, 73% of the 255 rules protecting the nation&apos;s land, air and water, and all that lives there, are affected. Caroline Spelman, the environment secretary, has now published the full document, an accurate summary of which I had obtained. Some of the regulations being scrapped are clearly obsolete, while others appear to be tidying up a few overlapping rules.  That would make the absurd secrecy and paranoia I encountered pretty laughable - no-one at all would speak to me - except for three things.  First, many of the regulations being cut remain a source of deep concern. Second, the government continues to spin this slashing of green regulations as led by the public, when that is demonstrably false. Third, it&apos;s not over yet. Work is now underway on a &quot;significant rationalisation of guidance&quot;, a phrase that tallies with Letwin&apos;s desire to see the 10,000 pages of guidance bolied down to 50, as has happened to planning regulation. However, let&apos;s hear from Spelman first. She wasn&apos;t actually at the key &quot;star chamber&quot; meeting in January, but she&apos;s leading the announcement of its results today. &quot;I want to be very clear that this is not about rolling back environmental safeguards, nor is it just about cutting regulation to stimulate growth. This was about getting better rules, not weaker ones,&quot; she said. &quot;The results of the red tape challenge (RTC) will be good for the environment and good for business, because as well as upholding environmental protection we will remove unnecessary bureaucracy to allow businesses to free up resources to invest in growth.&quot;  She reckons businesses will gain 1bn over five years as a result, but will that be offset by losses to others due to increased environmental damage? You can see all the measures here, but I have chosen a few examples for you to consider:  &quot;Reducing uncertainty about when contaminated land needs to be remediated&quot; will mean fewer sites are decontaminated, saving 140m (page 6)  More works can be carried out on common land without planning consent (p12)  Construction sites will no longer need plan how to manage their waste (p4)  The obligation for electrical equipment and battery manufacturers to take financial responsibility for their waste will be weakened (p3-4)  In wildlife and landscape management, 35 &quot;out-of-date&quot; regulations are being scrapped and 69 are being &quot;improved&quot; (p12)  The ban on selling second-hand goods containing asbestos will be scrapped (p6) Unconvinced this is all utterly benign? Blame yourself, because according to business minister Mark Prisk, it was you who wanted all these changes: &quot;The comments made on the website, by people who deal with these regulations every day, are what has driven this whole process, and I&apos;m pleased that so many people have taken this chance to have their say.&quot; Except that my analysis shows that 97% of the thousands of public responses on the RTC website demanded stronger protection or no change in the rules on air pollution, wildlife and landscape management. Futhermore, a robust opinion poll from YouGov/Greenpeace shows that when asked what you think about the current safeguards that protect Britain&apos;s wildlife and countryside, only 4% said they were too strong, with ten times more saying they were too weak, and 37% said they were about right. The businessman brought in as &quot;sector champion for the environment RTC theme&quot; describes the process rather more accurately, in my view: &quot;I&apos;m delighted that so many businesses have contributed to this unique opportunity to ease the burdens placed on industry by some overly complex and unnecessary environmental regulations,&quot; said Robert Hunt, executive director at the multinational colossus Veolia Environmental Services. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the wheels of Whitehall are still whirring on the red tape wheeze. The department for environment&apos;s (Defra) press release said: &quot;Many comments [sic] in the RTC suggested that the environmental framework - covering 257 regulatory instruments, over 10,000 pages of guidance and 397 data sets - is overly complex and inconsistent and gets in the way of businesses complying effectively with their environmental obligations. Defra will start work immediately with business and environment organisations to identify the scope for significant rationalisation of guidance.&quot; Wasn&apos;t that the point of the RTC in the first place? I&apos;m told Defra believe there&apos;s &quot;more we can do, that we couldn&apos;t do in the time available&quot;. Does that sound reassuring to you?",

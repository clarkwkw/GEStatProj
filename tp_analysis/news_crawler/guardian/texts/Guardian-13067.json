    "text": "There&apos;s money to be made out of rubbish it seems - or at least, significant savings. Over the last 10 years, Leeds Metropolitan http://www.leedsmet.ac.uk/ sustainability manager Mark Warner has become an expert on every possible way of reducing and recycling waste: what he and his team have achieved means, for example, that his employer is now able to offset all business travel against the university&apos;s reduced carbon footprint. The Zero Waste to Landfill contract was a goal that took seven years to reach, but Leeds Met&apos;s initial aims for the project now go way beyond that, influencing local recycling businesses decisions to invest in greater capacity and using the university&apos;s procurement power to ensure that, for example, contractors must now meet a 90% recycling target for refurbishment and construction projects. Educating design teams, contractors and their various suppliers in how to use the WRAP Net Waste Toolkit [http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/net-waste-tool-0] has boosted skills levels in local companies that they can market to other clients. On campus too, the Zero Waste to Landfill project has involved educating, incentivising and inspiring staff, students and visitors to the university to take action to reduce their environmental footprint.  The project is entirely self funding through the savings made in landfill tax, and in some cases, the university makes money through its recycling efforts, with contractors paying back a percentage of their profits.",

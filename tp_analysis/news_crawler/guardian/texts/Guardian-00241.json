    "text": "Everyone knows that the best Halloween costumes are the topical ones. And usually the worst, too. On top of the obvious ones  there are going to be a lot of Trumps and Clintons hitting the streets at the end of this month  theres the all-important meme selection to pay attention to. Harambe costumes are easy enough: just dress up as a gorilla and carry a doll. Ken Bone, who is a man who asked a question, requires nothing more than a red cardigan and an air of bafflement. But the Galaxy Note 7 is harder to pull off. That did not deter Imgur user excit3d.     The costume.   Yes, thats a smoking stack of Note 7 boxes. The phone, which has been on fire (not figuratively) for several weeks now, has officially crossed the threshold to Halloween costume. As well as giving a brief breakdown on how he made it (spoilers: a lot of empty boxes and a tube for blowing smoke through them), excit3d also described his fiances matching costume: The finished costume will add caution tape and my fiance is dressing as a firefighter and she will be following me around with a fire extinguisher. It might not be such a good idea to copy him unless youre pretty sure you wont need to go in a public space wearing your costume, though. Even online, people have confused his costume for a fake suicide vest to the point where he had to post a disclaimer. The Galaxy Note 7 sizzles and catches on fire, which is really shitty but it doesnt explode like everyone in the media is saying. So though it may LOOSELY resemble a suicide vest, that was not my intent. Please do not get shot by police who think you are wearing a suicide vest. That would be a bad Halloween for all.  Samsung owners furious as company resists paying up for Note 7 fire damage ",

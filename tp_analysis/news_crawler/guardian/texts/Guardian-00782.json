    "text": "           National Grid&apos;s job is to connect people to the energy they use. From the warmth and light we rely on at home, and the power which keeps our factories and offices going, to the infrastructure that are essential parts of our modern lifestyle. National Grid owns and manages the grids to which many different energy sources are connected. In Britain we run systems that deliver gas and electricity across the entire country. In the North Eastern US, we provide power directly to millions of customers. We hold a vital position at the centre of the energy system. We join everything up. That puts National Grid at the heart of one of the greatest challenges facing our society; the creation of new sustainable energy solutions and the development of an energy system that can underpin our economic prosperity in the 21st century.",

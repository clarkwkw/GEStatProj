    "text": "     They may lack the exotic ring of Venice&apos;s Piazza San Marco or Marrakech&apos;s Djemaa el-Fna, but Norwich&apos;s planned Rain Square and Flood Park may one day earn a little renown of their own in the epic battle with the weather. After England&apos;s wettest year on record, planners this spring will be asked to grant consent to 670 homes by the confluence of the Wensum and Yare rivers featuring these new public spaces, where half the site has a high probability of flooding and its edge is only 45cm (18in) above sea level. The project, described as a folly by opponents, is a bellwether for Britain&apos;s readiness to tackle the twin pressures of rising floodwaters  which the Environment Agency estimates put one in six homes at risk  and ever increasing housing demand in popular places such as Norwich. In a counter-intuitive attempt to persuade homebuyers to set aside their fear of the rising tide, the scheme proposes homes around marshes, squares that are designed to become ponds, and parks that become small lakes. Other plans are afoot too. Next month the UK&apos;s first floating house will go on site by the Thames at Marlow, while a scheme has been proposed to flood 100 hectares (250 acres) of threatened farmland at Littlehampton to create a lagoon development. But amid the innovations, involving water architecture specialists and Dutch engineers, there are questions about the willingness of national and local politicians to fully grasp an issue that saw swaths of the country affected by floods over Christmas and the new year. The Guardian has learned that the government chose to delay the introduction of critical anti-flood measures until 2014 after lobbying by Britain&apos;s biggest house builders. Regulations to demand better drainage of new housing developments using wetlands, reed beds, drainage channels and porous driveways to help prevent run-off flooding that threatens an estimated 2.8m homes was postponed last year after the Home Builders Federation complained to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) about the cost. Barratt Homes, Redrow, Bovis and other house builders were supposed to take responsibility for building systems to ensure water that drains from new estates soaks into the ground rather than running off to cause flooding locally. But they have written to Defra minister Richard Benyon saying the standards, which have been championed by ecologists and flood experts, are &quot;flawed and would raise design, cost and other problems for house builders&quot;. They also warned the scheme would &quot;present a significant risk to the delivery of new housing&quot;, and the government announced an 18-month delay. A spokeswoman for Defra said there should be &quot;no extra burdens on property developers which impact on the drive for growth&quot;. The regulations have also been challenged by councils worried about who would pay for upkeep. Philip Atkinson, planning consultant on the Norwich project on the Deal Ground area, is at the sharp end. As his shoes squelched through the sodden moss where children may one day play in Flood Park, he expressed frustration at politicians&apos; aversion to tackling the flooding problem creatively. &quot;Rather than being fearful of the flood event you could look forward to it because at that point your environment changes in an exciting way,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a counter-intuitive way of planning because people normally argue you should build up to avoid floods,&quot; added Robert Barker, director of Baca Architects, the company which helped design the scheme, as well as the plans at Littlehampton and Marlow. &quot;We are saying let water in rather than letting it flood properties further downstream. Working with the water has made for better planning, with more green areas, more play areas, car clubs and cycle paths in areas of flooding. It encourages healthier, more people-friendly plans.&quot; Making room for water in housing developments is controversial and opponents describe the scheme at Deal Ground, between Norwich city centre and the Broads, as foolhardy and contrary to the natural role of flood plains as marshy sponges, not forecourts to developments. Matt Williams, chairman of the Norwich Rivers History Group, showed the Guardian photographs of the 1912 flood, when bridges, factories and houses collapsed and four people died. The implication was clear: much of the site is susceptible to a 100-year flood (ie, a flood level that has a 1% chance of happening in any year) and is ripe for a repeat. &quot;This over-the-top, greedy proposal goes against the grain and we have no confidence that the designers, however well-motivated, can engineer away the profound flood risk,&quot; said Williams. &quot;When the water isn&apos;t there the drainage channels between the buildings will be horrible smelly holes with supermarket trollies pushed into them.&quot; But with Met Office scientists predicting an ever wetter Britain and the government estimating the cost of flooding in England is more than 2bn annually, something has to happen, said the Environment Agency. &quot;There is a recognition that we need to take this very seriously,&quot; said Paul Lockhart, area flood risk manager for the agency. &quot;If you look at the climate change predictions for the east and West Midlands, winters are going to get 25% wetter and summers will be much stormier. What we have seen in the last six months is what the climate change predictions suggest.&quot; In West Sussex, where local authorities are considering a proposal to flood 100 hectares of vulnerable land by Littlehampton to create a lagoon surrounded by new development, some people are concerned at official inertia. &quot;This type of thing is difficult because it takes imagination, vision and money and a committee of councillors is unlikely to agree to do it,&quot; said Robert Boyce, who owns a redundant boat yard on Littlehampton&apos;s west bank and is backing the lagoon plan. &quot;Climate change is happening and it&apos;s important we use it for the benefit of the environment and nature as well as for those of us who live and work in flood risk areas.&quot; Farmers whose land would be flooded are opposed. Further upstream on the river Arun, the Environment Agency is about to open a consultation on weakening some flood defences. The problem is stark. &quot;There are 76 properties at risk of flooding in this area right now with defences in place,&quot; the agency said. &quot;We estimate there will be 867 properties at risk of flooding and erosion in this area in 100 years if we do nothing to manage those defences and as sea and river levels rise with climate change.&quot; As the appetite for waterside living increases, along with pressure on space, last year developers submitted plans for close to 28,000 homes on land prone to flooding, though some experts point out that development on higher ground is increasingly a flood risk too. &quot;We have tarmacked and paved and when we get the deluge there is nowhere for it to seep into the ground so it runs straight into the drains far too quickly,&quot; said Mary Dhonau, the chairwoman of the Flood Protection Association, a pressure group that calls for greater action to prevent flooding. &quot;In the 2007 floods most of the insurance claims were for surface water flooding, not for river flooding. Flooding is an issue for every new development, not just those on the flood plain.&quot; Back on the Norwich flood plain, Atkinson is convinced there is little choice but to be bold: &quot;The levels are rising, so everyone has to understand we have to start living with the water.&quot;",

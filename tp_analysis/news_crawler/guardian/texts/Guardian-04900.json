    "text": "The latest figures out from the Higher Education Statistics Agency may well fuel fears that grade inflation is rife in UK universities. The statistics show the proportion of undergraduates being awarded first-class degrees has risen rapidly in the last four years. The latest figures, from 2010-2011, reveal that almost one in six undergraduates at UK universities achieved a first (15.5%). This compares to one in eight (12.6%) in 2006-07. The proportion of firsts for each university will be published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency on 23 February. It will be interesting to see whether particular groups of universities are awarding many more firsts than they used to be, or if all are. So is this grade inflation or has the calibre of students attending UK universities dramatically improved? Bahram Bekhradnia, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says it may be a combination.  This is a huge increase. I suspect students have become more serious as the job market becomes tougher. They are pulling their fingers out.  Bekhradnia says teaching may well be better. Lecturers now face rigorous training before they teach undergraduates.  There&apos;s no doubt that one can be concerned about grade inflation. But we don&apos;t know how much, if at all, this has contributed.  Geoffrey Alderman, a professor of politics at Buckingham University and a former university administrator, says that universities that experience a jump in the number of firsts should conduct inquiries into why this might be. The Higher Education Statistics Agency says the firsts do not disproportionately come from overseas students.",

    "text": "While universities continue to be deeply concerned about the impact of government policy on the recruitment of international students, a new threat is seen as emerging in the form of the increased scrutiny being given by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to compliance with their sponsor duties. This is despite the fact that the vast majority of universities will come through the inspection process relatively unscathed provided they recognise compliance is an important issue and take steps to address it. All education providers taking international students on long term courses must be licenced by the UKBA, which takes the view that those who benefit most directly from migration should help to prevent the system being abused. Education providers are given a range of sponsor duties for record keeping, monitoring and reporting students. They must satisfy themselves that an international student is able and intends to follow the course and keep records of the students&apos; passport, qualifications, attendance and contact details. They must monitor and report to the UKBA if a student fails to enrol on the course, withdraws or misses 10 consecutive contacts or there are other changes in a student&apos;s circumstances. The UKBA police the system through announced and unannounced visits. Failure to comply can lead to the suspension or revocation of a sponsor&apos;s licence or a reduction in the number of international students that the institution is allowed to recruit. If a licence is revoked the institution will no longer be able to recruit international students. Existing students will have their permission to stay curtailed. There is no right of appeal against the revocation of a licence which has led to a huge upsurge in judicial review cases. Private colleges have long been accustomed to the strict application of these standards and many have suffered the consequences. Universities have fared much better despite bitter criticism from the private sector over a perceived disparity in treatment. Several universities have had licences suspended but so far no university has had its licence revoked. But a recent increase in UKBA visits to universities has caused many to ensure that they have their houses in order. Despite some universities saying that UKBA demands are unreasonable and that they cannot or in extreme cases will not meet the requirements, they are achievable. A small amount of pain may be involved but generally significant improvement can be achieved at relatively low cost. In most cases, it comes down to organisation. All relevant departments need to be aware of the part they play in compliance and the importance of the preservation of the university&apos;s UKBA licence. The university must show that it understands and is in control of its sponsor duties and is not relying on reputation alone to see it through. The UKBA is not necessarily looking for perfection but for evidence that institutions are taking compliance seriously and making efforts to fulfil their sponsor duties. The key to assessing readiness is in the triangulation of systems, documentation and evidence of implementation. Everyone must understand and be capable of describing their role. Procedures should be documented to ensure that they are capable of being applied consistently. Where commitments are made to a process or procedure, there must be evidence of implementation. UKBA inspections may include examinations of files and interviews of staff and students. There is no point in describing a system for recording student contact details if on examination half of them are missing. Nor will it help if the university states that tutors are responsible for recording attendance but records show that it is not being done. Despite all of the scare stories, sponsor compliance should not be allowed to get out of proportion but should be part of normal procedures. The UKBA is not setting universities up to fail. Compliance is achievable and can also contribute to improving the student experience through the provision of better quality information. Equally, universities cannot close their eyes and hope for the best as they may well be called to account.

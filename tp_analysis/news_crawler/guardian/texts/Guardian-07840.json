Question: This large and distinctive Australian mystery bird is part of a group of birds that has a remarkable evolutionary history. What history is that? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is an adult white-bellied sea-eagle, Haliaeetus leucogaster, a member of Accipitridae, the hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures -- large raptors.  The white-bellied sea-eagle is a large raptor with long, broad wings and a short, wedge-shaped tail. Adults&apos; upperparts and underparts are mostly white, including the head, leg feathering and tip of the tail. The primaries are black and the base of the tail is grey. The hooked bill is blue-grey with a black tip, irides are dark brown and legs and feet are pale pink. Juveniles have mostly dark brown upperparts with buffy or creamy markings and the head is pale creamy-white. The underparts are dark brown. Adult plumage is achieved over a period of years during a series of moults.  White-bellied sea-eagles are resident in India, Sri Lanka, southern China, and ranges south through southeast Asia, the Philippines, Wallacea and New Guinea to Australia. They associate with water -- large rivers, wetlands and coastal areas and they also inhabit nearby islands in tropical and temperate areas. White-bellied sea-eagles feed opportunistically on a variety of animals -- fish, birds, reptiles, mammals and crustaceans, and on carrion and offal. They also steal prey from seabirds and other raptors, and sometimes follow dolphins to feed on fleeing prey. The genus, Haliaeetus, is quite interesting for several reasons. Almost all of these birds are &quot;species pairs&quot; of reciprocal sister species that consist of a white-headed and a brown-headed species. The white-bellied sea-eagle&apos;s species pair is Sanford&apos;s sea-eagle, H. sanfordi, which is endemic to the Solomon Islands, an island cluster located east of Papua New Guinea. Interestingly, with the exception of this species pair, adults of all Haliaeetus sister species pairs have all-white tails.  Another interesting bit of information that I dug up is this genus is amongst the oldest living genera of birds: fossil evidence [free PDF] shows this genus predates modern humans by millions of years.

    "text": "Just 2% of the British public believes that David Cameron has been successful in his pledge to lead the &quot;greenest government ever&quot;, a new YouGov poll reveals. Respondents were asked to rate the government&apos;s green credentials, including how well it has lived up to the promise that the prime minister made just three days after he took office. In a visit to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, Cameron told Chris Huhne and civil servants that &quot;there is a fourth minister in this department who cares passionately about this agenda and that is me, the prime minister, right. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.&quot; But cuts to renewable energy subsidies, anti-environment rhetoric by the chancellor, George Osborne, and a letter from 101 Tory MPs attacking onshore wind power have raised fears among environmentalists and business leaders about the coalition&apos;s commitment to the green agenda.",

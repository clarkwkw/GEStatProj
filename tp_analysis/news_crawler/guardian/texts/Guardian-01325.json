    "text": "Puzzle game Puddle asks nothing moreof the player than to guide a smallbody of fluid into a goal by tilting each 2D level left and right and allowing gravity to do its thing. In reality, navigatingPuddle&apos;s winding mazes and obstacles is remarkably tricky. It&apos;s a testament to the work put into a title that won an award in the student section at the independent games festival; ithas some brilliant touches, with the streamlinedcontrol system and varietyof ideas keeping it fresh and rewarding throughout. However, any player familiar with gaming innovations of the past few years will have seen a lot of what&apos;s on offer here already, much of it deliveredwith a little more flair elsewhere (Sony&apos;sLocoRoco, for example). And yet, while occasionally fallingfoul of some of the cliches of hipgame design, it&apos;s visually splendidand, at just under 7, represents good value for money.",

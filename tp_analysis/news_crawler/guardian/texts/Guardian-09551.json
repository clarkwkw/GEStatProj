    "text": "This atmospheric first-person puzzler has more than a little in common with Valve&apos;s spatial-awareness masterpiece (and, really, thank videogames for making such an unlikely phrase into reality) Portal. Instead of firing wormholes to short-circuit geography, though, here it&apos;s balls of black paint to reveal geography, giving shape and perspective to an otherwise blindingly white and impenetrable maze. Also, as with Portal, it feels like the mischievous world-tinkering came first and the story was filled in later, though the tale of an orphan exploring the unfinished artworks of his absent mother is a fine fit with the game&apos;s hushed monochromatic feel. Not that it stays monochromatic. Feeling a path with paint is just the first stage of what builds into an ever more complex set of puzzling scenarios  spreading climbable vines through an abandoned castle by firing giant drops of water, using a glowing ball to light a path through a dangerous shadowy forest, and eventually building blocks, steps and towers to negotiate taxing 3D obstacles. It&apos;s wonderfully inventive and, being a downloadable title, relatively short, which means none of the various mechanics feels over-used. Critically, despite requiring the occasional bit of nimble jump-and-dash co-ordination, the game is rarely frustrating, making The Unfinished Swan an ingenious, challenging joy.",

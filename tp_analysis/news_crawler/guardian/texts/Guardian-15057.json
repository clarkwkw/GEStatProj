    "text": "TweetDeck Limited has been struck off the register at Companies House after Twitter directors repeatedly failed to file formal accounts for the company over the last eight months. San Francisco-based Twitter bought TweetDeck, a popular Twitter app among users, in 2011 for an estimated 25m. Founder Iain Dodsworth was removed as director of TweetDeck Limited and replaced with Dick Costolo, Twitter&apos;s chief executive, and Alex Macgillivray, head of trust and policy. Companies House has formally written to both directors and issued them with a series of nominal fees for failing to meet the filing deadlines. Companies House records now show TweetDeck Limited as formally dissolved. A spokesperson for Twitter said: &quot;TweetDeck the product continues to thrive as part of Twitter, but the old company has been dormant for some time, with no outstanding liabilities; hence our agreement with the move to dissolve it.&quot; Twitter is continuing to develop and refine the TweetDeck product, for which it acquired all intellectual property and assets under terms of the acquisitions. This week it is shutting down the Android, iPhone and Air versions to prioritise development of the more complex desktop tool. Nine full-time developers work on the product in London and more developers are being recruited. The closure of TweetDeck Limited will have no impact on users or the performance of the software.",

    "text": "The summer migrants have arrived. The swallows and sand martins are skimming over the fields, and doing acrobatics in the sky. The hedgerows are shimmering green with the hawthorn breaking into leaf, interspersed with a sprinkling of blackthorn blossom. Fieldsare chequered with golden crops of oil seed rape, but the winter barley looks cold and parched. To my right the sky is bright and sunny but to my left it is an ominous indigo colour. Nevertheless, I set off from Kiplingcotes station, near Market Weighton, following the disused railway track, which is part of the Hudson Way. However, the black clouds soon win the battle overhead and it starts to rain,heavy drops to begin with, but I soon realise that this is not just asharpshower, it has set in for the afternoon. These April showers are muchneeded. I stop on the bridge that takes the track over the country lane, and as I look out over the wolds I hear a buzzard mewing as it soars and circles around, before heading off to a David Hockney-like stand of winter trees, just waiting to have leaves painted on them. There is a familiar chuffing sound, and I spy a pair of red-legged partridges in the field below: sensing me watching them, they were frozen to the ground. Along the track are spikes of white dead-nettle in a sheltered spot, bejewelled with many seven-spot ladybirds, although the clumps of violets and cowslips have their heads bowed to therain. All along the way I heard the plaintive notes of willow warblers and two-note calls of the chiffchaff: these arevery insignificant birds to look at, but they are a distinctive sound of summer.",

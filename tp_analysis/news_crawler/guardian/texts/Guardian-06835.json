    "text": "Publisher Collins has announced that for the first time members of the public will be able to submit new words for possible inclusion in future editions of its dictionary. And yes, it has already taken delivery of &quot;omnishambles&quot;, which made its original outing in The Thick of It, and was then used by Ed Miliband at PMQs this April. Original coinages are a long shot  all nominations will be assessed on usage  but Collins&apos; editors aim to review words after a year, so you&apos;ll have a chance to popularise your invention. The following are humbly submitted for approval: Amazebollocks. adj. Cautious, have-it-both-ways interjection that combines amazement with profound scepticism. G4S-tation. n. The catastrophic clearance of the landscape of all private security personnel, generally through incompetence; the polar opposite of recruitment. Dreckfest. n. Mid-morning meal, normally consumed in front of whatever happens to be on ITV2 at that hour. Ausumn. n. A season of cold, wet weather, characterised by high winds, heavy rains and restricted daylight, which immediately precedes winter and begins on 1 June. Pre-cession. n. A former period of economic stagnation that, in hindsight, seems really great compared to now.",

    "text": "A lot of cars now have arear-view camera tohelp with parking. You put it into reverse, the camera comes on, and an image of what&apos;s behind you appears on a screen on the dashboard. Quite handy  especially for ladies you might say (if you were a sexist, but I&apos;m not so I&apos;ll say especially for women). C&apos;mon, let us have parking, we&apos;ve relinquished everything else. And I&apos;ve found a study, actualstatistics. Anyway, you generally find rear-view cameras only on quite posh cars, ones that have screens for satnavs and all the multimedia stuff. This isn&apos;t a posh car, it&apos;saFordFiesta. There&apos;s no satnavscreen. So where does the rear-view camera display appear? Inthe rear-view mirror. Perfect  that&apos;s where you&apos;d expect to look to see behind you. And you can check the camera&apos;s view against the mirror&apos;s, to make sure one of them isn&apos;t lying. The only puzzling thing is that the first time it comes on, a warning sign pops up, along with what looks like a picture of a book. This has me and my girlfriend (there she is!) wondering what book it might be. Alice Through The Looking Glass? Mansfield Park? Stuart: A Life Backwards? Etc. Or possibly it&apos;s telling you to refer to the manual. Oh, the rear-view camera is an extra  an extra 475. Nah, forget it. Especially if you&apos;re a fella, ella ella. Be a man, look over your shoulder. What about going forwards then? Well, it&apos;s really rather good. As afamous motoring journalist, I drive a lot of new cars. And to be honest they&apos;re all pretty good these days. But also very few stand out, unless they&apos;re either something cute (Fiat 500, say) or quick (Nissan GT-R) or stately (Bentley Mulsanne). The humble Ford Fiesta manages to stand out without being any of those things. Well, stand out a bit  Imean it&apos;s not going to turn many heads. But I do really like it, and it&apos;s not often I think that about a car. That&apos;s it, it&apos;s a very likable car. Why? Well, mainly because it&apos;svery nice to drive. Nothing blistering, but it&apos;s agile round town, precise and well-behaved. And on the open road it seems to grow by a few inches, feels like a more grown-up car. It&apos;s comfortable, the seats are great, the ride is good, inside it&apos;squite stylish. Iteven looks niceon the outside, too, certainly much more elegant than the previous model. That&apos;s enough, isn&apos;t it? A small car that&apos;s fun to drive, nice to look at and doesn&apos;t cost too much. And which, for an extra 475, will certainly help you park whether you&apos;re a he or a she, and possibly also encourage you to read.

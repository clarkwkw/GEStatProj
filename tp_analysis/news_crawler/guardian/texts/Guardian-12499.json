    "text": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team What are the new connectors on the bottom of the Surface Pro for? &gt;&gt; Reddit To which the reply from the Microsoft Surface team is:   &quot;Wow - I&apos;m pumped you caught that - we haven&apos;t announced what they are for but they aren&apos;t an accident! At launch we talked about the &quot;accessory spine&quot; and hinted at future peripherals that can click in and do more. Those connectors look like [they] can carry more current than the pogo pins, don&apos;t they?&quot;   As if you&apos;d have connectors there by accident. Wireless charging or battery-enabled keyboards, for sure. (Thanks @mbrit on Twitter.) Interactive generative art &gt;&gt; Silk Your timewaster for today. Has different colours, symmetry and also sound. (Implemented in Javascript.) Samsung Ventures adds Cloudant to its portfolio of leading mobile service solution and data network companies &gt;&gt; SourceWire  Cloudant, a leading provider of a globally distributed database-as-a-service (DBaaS), today announced that Samsung Venture Investment Corporation (Samsung Ventures) has made a strategic investment in the company. The funding will be used to advance research and development to further improve global data distribution technologies and mobile application data management.  Global data distribution, mobile replication and synchronisation, expert monitoring, and scalable performance are key features demanded by government agencies, enterprise customers, and small- to medium-sized businesses.   Wonder what Samsung would want by investing in that? Global data distribution is the sort of thing you&apos;d do for, say, maps or email. BlackBerry Statement &gt;&gt; Yahoo! Finance  &quot;In Canada, yesterday was the best day ever for the first day of a launch of a new BlackBerry smartphone. In fact, it was more than 50% better than any other launch day in our history in Canada,&quot; said Thorsten Heins, President &amp; CEO of BlackBerry. &quot;In the UK, we have seen close to three times our best performance ever for the first week of sales for a BlackBerry smartphone.&quot;   That&apos;s great! Er... which was the previous best launch, then? Can&apos;t seem to find that. Is this like those magic tricks where we think of a number and then treble it? Say what you like about Apple (and so many do) but at least it gives quantifiable figures when it trumpets things. Is Pebble Shipping? &gt;&gt; Pebble At the time of writing, 2,280 have in the US, 420 to the rest of the world, 13,370 made. As a reminder, the Pebble is the &quot;wearable&quot; smart watch for iOS and Android. Analysis of tablet and smartphone users debunks printing, scanning, and document management myths &gt;&gt; IDC  The explosion of smartphone and tablet adoption will impact printing, scanning, document management, and print volumes in surprising ways over the next five years. According to a new International Data Corporation (IDC) survey of 800 unique respondents, smartphone and tablet users - whom the survey found to be younger, more likely male, have higher incomes, and increasingly hectic travel schedules - are surprisingly more likely than non-users to drive print. Smartphone and tablet users are more likely than non-users to print 16 of 20 business applications from their PCs . The share of users printing from their smartphones and tablets will increase dramatically if users have their way, and the need to enable print and educate users how to print is clear. The percentage of users who printed from their mobile devices increased dramatically in 2012, and the percentage of those who do not print, and do not want to print, will decline from almost 50% in 2012 to just 25% in 2015 according to respondents. However, a large percentage of smartphone and tablet users do not know how to print from their devices, and a large share say their company has not yet enabled mobile printing.   Should be a relief for printer-reliant HP, at least. Free as in unlicensed: why the FCC isn&apos;t giving away wireless service to anybody &gt;&gt; Project Disco  A front-page story in the Washington Post offered a simplified, optimistic read on part of this effort: a proposal to invite unlicensed use of some frequencies liberated by rearranging TV channels. Cecilia Kang&apos;s piece included caveats further down about the limits of any free service, but if you stopped at the headline and opening paragraphs that used &quot;free&quot; as a synonym for &quot;unlicensed&quot; - or read glib rewrites elsewhere - the story shouted &quot;Free Public WiFi!&quot;  The reality has no exclamation point and many question marks.   Sorry to reality check y&apos;all. Sorry, Google+ users, those Super Bowl hashtags really were for Twitter &gt;&gt; Marketing Land Danny Sullivan:   Soon after our post about Twitter being referenced in 50% of Super Bowl commercials, and Google+ being shut out, the Google+ defenders started complaining. Since Google+ supports hashtags, was our analysis biased toward Twitter? Nope, some further analysis shows.  You can see some of the complaints in the comments to our original post, and I received a few when I shared our story to Google+ yesterday. As a result of that, I started doing some counting yesterday, to see if those hashtags really were aimed at Google or not.   A definitive analysis involving tumbleweed.

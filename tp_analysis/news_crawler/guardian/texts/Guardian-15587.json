    "text": "    The latest in a long line of government spending reviews, this one covering the period 2015-16, is looming - and many in the science community are getting worried. In the last such review, in 2010, the UK&apos;s science budget was nominally frozen and is supposedly protected from being raided by the parent ministry, the department for Business, Innovation and Skills. However, rumours abound, and the coincidence of a spending review in which non ringfenced departments such as BIS have to find major savings with the Triennial Review of the Research Councils has left some worried that major structural changes may be in the offing. The latest such rumour, reported by Times Higher Education, concerns the Medical Research Council. It has been suggested that ministers may be considering shifting the MRC&apos;s 500 million plus budget to the Department of Health. This is certainly in line with rumours that a number of cabinet ministers have been seeking to reclassify spending from their own departments into those areas such as health, education and international development which have been ringfenced. And the idea of merging the MRC with the Department of Health&apos;s research programmes to create a single entity has been floated before. A move would certainly help relieve pressure on BIS to make further cuts, especially if responsibility for meeting the costs of medical education were also transferred to the health department, as is also rumoured. But there are difficulties: the MRC, like all the research councils, has a UK-wide remit whilst the main focus of the Department of Health is on health policy for England only. And it is not entirely clear (to me anyway) whether it is the Department of Health&apos;s budget as a whole that is ringfenced or just that of the (English) NHS, the major component, so the precise arrangements might matter a great deal to the chances of medical research spending being protected.  So how likely is a major structural change like this, and what might be the consequences? The Medical Research Council is actually the longest-lived of the UK&apos;s research councils, having received its charter in 1920 but tracing its origins back to the National Insurance Act of 1911, and the establishment of a fund for medical research from national insurance contributions under the control of a Medical Research Committee. In 1918 the Haldane Report into the machinery of government recommended, partly inspired by the example of the Medical Research Committee, that funding decisions about research &quot;of a general character&quot; be kept at arms-length from the big sectoral ministries (which should however continue to fund research to support their own needs and policy goals). Thereafter, the Committee was transformed into a research council and aligned with existing arrangements for generally-applicable science and technology  the set of structures which evolved into the modern research council system.  The so-called Haldane Principle may, in its various modern incarnations, be an invented tradition but the general idea that there is something to be gained from an arms-length approach is a long-standing feature of UK science policy. Only recently, ministers have restated their commitment to a version of this principle. I find it hard to believe ministers would have the stomach for introducing such a major structural change, whatever the short-term advantage in meeting Treasury targets, and regardless of what the triennial review might conceivably recommend (paywalled link). And surely neither BIS ministers nor HM Treasury will want to give the appearance of jeopardising what is widely regarded as an important investment in the future at a time when they don&apos;t have too many other positive investment stories to tell. Of course I could be wrong, but I hope not. There may be legitimate questions about co-ordinating MRC and Department of Health/NHS research spending - though some effort has already been expended in this regard. And perhaps it might be possible to attribute a portion of the MRC spend to the Health budget without changing structures. Certainly, making structural changes in an established system is always risky. And the UK science base is a highly geared, fiercely competitive system - even seemingly straightforward changes could have major consequences. Making such changes for reasons of short term expediency would seem to me to be particularly courageous, in the Yes, Minister sense.

    "text": "Vodafone is warning UK customers with iPhone 4S handsets not to update to iOS 6.1. The software update from Apple went out at the end of January, but Vodafone appears to have had customers reporting difficulty. In its statement, Vodafone says &quot;Some customers may occasionally experience difficulty in connecting to the network to make or receive calls or texts or to connect to the Internet. Apple is working on a solution to their software issue. These connection problems are intermittent.&quot; It says that the bug affects 3G performance. Other users on different networks have not reported any problems. Michelle Murhead, based in Glasgow, tweeted a screenshot of the warning. Vodafone UK is referring customers to the statement. Apple hadn&apos;t responded to a request for comment by publication. Update: users on Three&apos;s network in Austria are being given the same advice if they have a 4S handset. Here&apos;s the original statement, repeated by a user on Facebook; the Google translation reads: &quot;Dear 3 customer! The update of the iPhone 4S on iOS 6.1 can currently cause connectivity problems. We responded quickly and are working with Apple on a solution to the problem. For this reason, we recommend not to install the update for the time being. We will inform you immediately if there is a solution. Your 3 ServiceTeam.&quot;",

    "text": "People who send their children to private schools are seeking to buy an advantage for them (I might send my son to private school  Clegg, 25 January). These schools perpetuate inequality of opportunity, not because the teaching in them is better, but because they enjoy resources state schools cannot aspire to and because they are still an integral component of a wider system in which background, class and financial circumstances are huge factors in a young person&apos;s prospects. Many parents who want the very best for their children could never afford to have them educated privately; others choose not to do so because they recognise that political beliefs and principles are meaningless if we apply them only to other people and not to ourselves or our own children. Nick Clegg needs to recognise that he cannot be one person as a parent and another as a politician; David Hanson (Letters, 28 January) should understand that there are indeed very many deeply conscientious and committed parents who will not put the &quot;interests of their children&apos;s education first&quot; if that means colluding with a system riddled with unfairness.Jane Duffield-BishHethersett, Norfolk",

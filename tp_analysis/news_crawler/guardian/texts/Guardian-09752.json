    "text": "  'Breathe' by Dryden Goodwin - Video documentation from Dryden Goodwin on Vimeo.   Monet painted some his best impressionist pictures of the smog-bound Thames and the Houses of Parliament from a second-floor terrace at St Thomas&apos;s Hospital. Today they are recognised as pretty accurate representations of London&apos;s air pollution at the end of the 19th century. The famous London &quot;pea-souper&quot; smogs, caused mainly by coal-burning in hundreds of thousands of homes and factories, have now gone, only to be replaced by a cocktail of equally toxic, invisible chemicals emittted by vehicles, and yesterday the government issued a &quot;high&quot; air pollution alert for London and south-east England. But should the politicians in Westminster look back across the Thames, they will see a short animation film of a child projected on to a giant video screen in front of the same St Thomas&apos;s hospital that Monet painted from. Called Breathe, the film is made up from more 1,000 pencil drawings of London artist Dryden Goodwin&apos;s five-year-old son. The film will be played every night this week with the intention of highlighting the fragility of children living in polluted cities, and the dangers that pollution posesx. Goodwin created the work after he was linked by art curator Alice Sharp to Prof Frank Kelly, an expert on lung health at King&apos;s College London and an adviser to the government on air pollutants. Kelly&apos;s recent research has focused on the effects that measures such as the congestion charge and the low-emission zone have had on the lung health of children living in east London, whose developing respiratory systems are particularly sensitive to changes in air quality. Kelly says: &quot;Children are more vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs are underdeveloped at birth and mature slowly during childhood. Several studies have shown that breathing polluted city air is associated with significant adverse effects on children&apos;s respiratory health.&quot; London is one of the most polluted cities in Europe, with several thousand premature deaths attributed to air pollution a year. Levels of air pollution across London frequently exceed EU limits and breach World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. The WHO estimates that urban air pollution is responsible now globally for about 8% of lung cancer deaths, 5% of cardio-pulmonary deaths and about 3% of all respiratory infection deaths. Goodwin&apos;s film is the second in a series called Invisible Dust. Earlier this year in the run up to the Olympic Games, London artist Faisal Abdu&apos;Allah, also working with Kelly, showed how air pollution affected athletes.",

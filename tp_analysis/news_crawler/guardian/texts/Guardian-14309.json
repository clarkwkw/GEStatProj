    "headline": "Ban on London Met University enrolling foreign students lifted", 
    "text": "The Home Office has overturned a ban on London Metropolitan University admitting students from outside the European Union after agreeing it has made sufficient improvements to its monitoring systems. In August, the university became the first in the UK to be stripped of its right to sponsor students from outside the European economic area after evidence was uncovered of widespread abuse. The decision sparked anxiety at universities across the country amid fears it would damage the UK&apos;s reputation for higher education and deter applications from overseas students. Many institutions rely heavily on income from international students&apos; fees. A UK Border Agency investigation into London Met last year found that in more than a quarter of the cases it sampled, students did not have permission to stay in the country and a significant proportion did not have sufficient English. There was no proof that half of those sampled were turning up to lectures, UKBA said. The university had a &quot;serious systemic failure&quot; in its monitoring of overseas students. Mark Harper, the immigration minister, said a series of inspections over the past six months had shown the university had made the necessary improvements to its systems and administration. The university will be on probation for a year &quot;to build a track record of compliance&quot;, but can admit international students again, he said  although numbers will be restricted. Harper said it was &quot;in the interest of international students that all institutions take their immigration responsibilities seriously and demonstrate that they comply with the rules. We have worked closely with university staff to ensure that London Met standards were improved. As a result, the university now meets the required standards and we are able to grant a licence. We will continue to welcome the brightest and best students to our world-class universities.&quot; There are about 300,000 non-EU students at British universities at any one time, worth 5bn a year to the economy. The London Met decision left more than 2,000 international students in limbo. A temporary reprieve allowed students with full immigration status, who had already enrolled or been offered a place, to stay on until the end of the academic year or the end of their course, whichever was sooner. But two months after the decision, fewer than half the international students eligible to stay on had opted to do so. London Met said taking away its right to sponsor overseas students created a 30m hole in its budget. It was already having financial problems leading to a 70% cut in the number of its courses since 2009. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the academics&apos; University and College Union, said institutions had not yet felt the full impact of the UKBA&apos;s decision on Britain&apos;s reputation overseas. &quot;Hundreds of students faced a worrying period of insecurity and unnecessary costs as they tried to find somewhere else to study,&quot; she said. &quot;We are pleased the university has got its licence back, but feel the UKBA should have taken a less draconian approach and avoided the mess that so many students, the university and our international reputation got caught up in.&quot;",

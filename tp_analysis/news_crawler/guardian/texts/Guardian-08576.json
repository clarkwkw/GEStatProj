    "text": "Six degrees of Elizabeth Olsen? Or how about six degrees of Sean Connery? Depending on the way you play the game, these actors make a more logical choice for the popular game which claims that it is always possible to connect Kevin Bacon to another Hollywood actor in six or fewer associations. To aid the search for those connections, Google incorporated an Easter Egg search function on Thursday that makes it possible for people to search &quot;Bacon Number&quot; followed by an actor&apos;s name and see how many steps it takes to link them to the Apollo 13 star. With the introduction of this new function, it quickly became clear that the Bacon Number is not the hallowed symbol for Hollywood connectivity it once seemed, with most results showing an easy four or fewer associations to get to the actor. &quot;Anybody who is in modern Hollywood is basically two degrees from Kevin Bacon,&quot; said Patrick Reynolds, a computer scientist who runs the Oracle of Bacon site, which has been doing basically the same thing as the Google function since 1995 using the Internet Movie Database to analyze connection data. What&apos;s more, said Reynolds, approximately 99% of the 2.5 million actors in the IMDb are four degrees or fewer from Bacon. Which is why those seeking a true six-degrees challenge, should pick someone like young actress Elizabeth Olsen (Bacon Number: 2). The rising indie-film star is one of a few notable people who doesn&apos;t have a result on the Google Bacon Number function. This is because they use information from their Public Knowledge graph, which is based on search data, not the IMDb. Reynolds categorized the few people who surpass the Bacon four degree threshold in his data set as &quot;old, foreign and obscure&quot;. People like William Rufus Shafter, an army officer from the American civil war, who appeared as himself in two short silent films from 1898, and is one of 27 people who are a rule-breaking eight degrees from Bacon. And the notion that Bacon can always be reached by six degrees or less as the most connected actor in Hollywood is resoundingly false. There are 196 other actors whose connection is greater than the six-degree mark, which is one reason why the site has Bacon currently ranked as the 444th most connected actor in Hollywood. He cedes top billing as the most connected to Sean Connery, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Lee who are regularly at the top on the site&apos;s thousand most-connected actors list. &quot;It&apos;s mostly whose careers were active in the 60s, really for 40 or 50 years, and have international experience,&quot; Reynolds said. The connection data constantly fluctuates because every time a new movie comes out, actors get closer to being connected to Bacon.",

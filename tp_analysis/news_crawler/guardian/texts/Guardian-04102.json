A degree in economics will help you to explore these questions and much more. Its an exciting time to study this area - theres intense debate about the structures that underpin our economic systems, and the impact these have on our society and politics. Following the recent financial crisis, many courses have adapted their modules to reflect new ways of thinking. Youll learn about how wealth is created, or lost, what influences income, and how all of this information can be used to influence policy. Youll study the work of some of the worlds most high-profile economists, researching how and why their ideas were developed and how successful they were, and get the chance to think through a few of your own. Economics students can focus on particular areas of the subject, such as money, banking and finance, international economics and the EU, industrial policy, or public services such as health and education. By the end of your degree youll have a greater understanding of the financial markets and economic welfare, know what is meant by the phrase balance of payments, and will be quicker to realise how much the taxman is taking from your salary. You will learn how to assess expenditure decision, both in government and the private sector.

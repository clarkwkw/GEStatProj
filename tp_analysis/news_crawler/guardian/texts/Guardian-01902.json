    "headline": "Live Q&A: Climate scientist Michael Mann on the 'hockey stick' controversy", 
    "text": "The climate scientist Prof Michael Mann is one of the most divisive figures in the climate debate. His so-called &apos;Hockey Stick&apos; graph - which shows the rapid up-tick in global temperatures during the the 20th century - has become an important part of the evidence behind the idea that the climate is warming due to human activities. But it has attracted vehement criticism from those seeking to caste doubt on mainstream climate science.  In a recent interview with the Guardian he said: &quot;I think because the hockey stick became an icon it&apos;s been subject to the fiercest of attacks really in the whole science of climate change.&quot; But he accepts that criticism - which is often very personal - has become &quot;part of the job description&quot; for climate scientists. In his new book, The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the front lines, Mann tells the story of the science and politics behind the Hockey Stick controversy. He also gives an account of the fall out from the unlawful release of emails between climate researchers at the University of East Anglia and their colleagues around the world - including Mann himself. Questions poured in from Quora and in the comments so quickly that the man behind the &quot;hockey stick&quot; controversy struggled to keep up. We&apos;ve put together the results of the &quot;fast and furious&quot; conversation for you here:  Mortice opened the session:   Dear MikeThanks for agreeing to answer questions.Do you think we are seeing a change in the role of the scientist from disinterested producer of knowledge, to one that by necessity also includes public advocacy (we see this in particular in response to external attacks on science by the politically and financially motivated).If so what are the pluses and negatives for this shift.Great book by the way, real eye-opener.   Answer: michaelemann   thanks so much Mortice (#1). Its my pleasure to field questions from folks about the book and related topics. Your question about the role of the scientist and &apos;advocacy&apos; is a great one, and its something I explore particularly in the epilogue of the book, where I describe my own evolution from, as you say, a &apos;disinterested producer of knowledge&apos; to an &apos;advocate&apos; of sorts. But I do draw an important distinction here. I believe that my role as a scientist, and now public figure, is to advocate for the need of policy to be informed by an accurate and honest assessment of the science and the uncertainties therein. I leave it to the public and policymakers to debate the solutions--there is a worthy debate to be had there. But there is no good faith debate to be had, any longer, about the reality of the problem.   Question: JasonP 28 February 2012 3:35PM   Hi Michael, thanks for taking the time to do this.In the presentation that you&apos;ve put together to accompany your book you compare projections from James Hansens&apos; climate models in the late 80&apos;s with actual observed data from weather stations and describe Hansen&apos;s Scenario B projection as &quot;pretty much spot on&quot;.Obviously other folk have made similar comparisons and concluded that Scenario B turned out on the high side. Which doesn&apos;t seem wholly unreasonable to my layperson brain as Hansen assumed a climate sensitivity of 4.2 Celsius per doubling of CO2 (which is somewhat high by current thinking) and following the collapse of the USSR real world emissions ended up being somewhat different to those assumed in Scenario B.Can you maybe talk (type?) very briefly about the discrepancy there and what you think Hansen got right and wrong.   Answer: michaelemann   Thanks Jason P (#2). Great question. Yes, the situation w/ the Hansen &apos;88 projections is a bit more nuanced, and its tough to get into all of the nuances in any short discussion. The bottom line is the equilibrium sensitivity of the model was a bit on the high side (about 4C/2xCO2---most models now have it closer to 3C) while the forcing scenario (B) was a bit on the low side. These two issues essentially cancel, and thus the observations roughly do follow scenario B.   Question: ArecBalrin 28 February 2012 3:38PM   In the aftermath of the release of the CRU e-mails, one good thing did come out of it: the debunking of the misrepresentations of their contents. Among these was the &apos;hide the declined&apos; one where certain outlets inaccurately said this referred to temperatures when it meant the decline in reliability of tree rings to read historical temperatures.Tree rings apparently stopped being accurate measures of historical temperatures around 1980. Has there been any explanation for why this is and are tree rings ever likely to be used to accurately read historical temperatures again?   Answer: michaelemann   Arec (#3): Thanks for your question. Actually, the &quot;hide the decline&quot; quote referred specifically to a set of tree-ring density measurements by Keith Briffa and colleagues. These are quite different from tree-ring *width* measurements, which are what my colleagues and I, and many other researchers, have often worked with.Briffa and colleagues were clear from the start (i.e. in their original &apos;98 Nature article presenting the data set) that these data do not reliability reflect temperature in the latter part of the 20th century (after 1960 certainly, and perhaps even after 1940). Tree-ring width data don&apos;t obviously show this problem, though there are indeed other issues (for example, my colleagues and I published a paper in Nature Geosciences just a few weeks ago showing that tree-ring widths from treeline locations may underestimate the large cooling events following particularly large volcanic eruptions). It is for these sorts of reasons that I have always advocated &apos;multiproxy&apos; reconstructions, which attempt to pull information from a diverse complementary set of proxy sources (tree-rings, corals, ice cores, speleothems, sediments, etc).   Question: SynchronisedDogmas 28 February 2012 3:39PM   Professor Mann,- At what point did you realise that &apos;climate skepticism&apos; is on the whole a denialist movement rather than a sceptical one, and can you remember what it was that brought about that realisation? Was it a road to Damascus moment, or a gradually dawning realisation?- As a scientist how difficult did you find it to initially understand the nature of denialist methods (which are antithetical to the scientific method), and how nave do you think the wider scientific community still is about the nature of anti-science denialism?Thanks   Answer: michaelemann   thanks Sychronized (#5) for the question, its a good one. I recount in my book the process by which I gradually recognized that many of those who were criticizing my co-authors and me were not engaged in good faith scientific debate, but instead were simply trying to discredit us, and climate change research more generally. I realized that such individuals are wholly undeserving of the term &apos;skeptic&apos; as they are anything but! Skepticism is an equal opportunity proposition, and must be applied to all sides, not just one.  Midway through the conversation, Michael apologized for not being able to keep up with the questions:  Folks, thanks for all of the questions. I have to apologize in advance that they are coming in so fast and furious that I won&apos;t be able to respond to all, but will do my best. Forgive me if some of my answers are necessarily short. Many of these questions alone are deserving of an hour-long discussion!   Question: paulja 28 February 2012 3:46PM    Dear Mike, Why, when the IPCC acknowledges that the effects of clouds and water vapour on climate sensitivity are poorly understood, do all GCMs assume strong positive feedback? Is there any science backing this, or is it just making use of the precautionary principle?ThanksPaul   Answer: michaelemann   Paulja: thanks for your question. Well, the models don&apos;t actually make any assumptions about these feedbacks. That&apos;s the beauty of it. They do their best to represent in some way the fundamental processes (cloud microphysics, conective instability, radiative transfer, etc.) and the feedbacks (i.e the impact on atmospheric and surface temperatures resulting from combination of albedo i.e. reflection, interaction with IR radiation, etc) emerge from the inclusion of those processes. Now, some of these processes are still rather uncertain, and can only be represented in the climate models through statistical representations (called &apos;parameterizations&apos;). It is these uncertainties that lead to the rather wide estimate of cloud radiative feedbacks seen e.g. in the most recent IPCC report. The most recent research however (e.g. the work of Andy Dessler of Texas A&amp;M) suggests that the true answer may be closer to the high end (i.e. clouds being a net positive feedback, rather than as previously thought, a net negative feedback). A good reminder that uncertainty doesn&apos;t necessarily break in our favor, when it comes to climate change projections.   Colin Gerber, Neuroscientist, Question submitted on Quora:   What does he think of Richard Muller&apos;s recent work on global warming? Have Muller&apos;s findings supporting your &apos;Hockey Stick&apos; graph changed the politics of climate change? Does being able to say &quot;Look even one of your guys has done the research and come up with the same results.&quot; help convince politicians that global warming is a serious issue? Has the work he has done (since it was done by a skeptic) help to change the minds of other skeptics who believe that the original data was faked or sloppily done?   Answer:michaelemann   Thanks for asking. I have mixed feelings about the Muller episode. It is useful that even one regarded as somewhat of a contrarian in the climate change debate, after taking a close, independent look at the observations, reaffirmed the work of dozens of scientists conducted over several decades. However, the idea that the entire community of climate science needed a &apos;maverick&apos; from the outside to confirm their findings is misleading at best. As my colleague Kerry Emanuel once put it, &quot;&quot;mavericks are indispensible to the progress of science&quot; but that those &quot;who make mascots out of mavericks are invariably engaging in advocacy.&quot;   Question: liamduff 28 February 2012 3:47PM   Prof. Mann, I would first like to thank you for your extraordinary work which is geared towards saving the planet and humanity from itself! The value of your work and the work of your colleagues will contribute massively to wellbeing of all.My question is: Given that the proven fundamental of climate change science are fairly basic and easy to understand (even to the layman if vaguely interested) why is it that society is allowing the debate on human caused climate change to continue and what does that say about society today in your opinion?   Answer: michaelemann   thanks LiamDuff, this is a question I&apos;ve pondered quite a bit, and talk about at some length in the book. Without going on at great length, suffice it to say that the implications of climate change are quite threatening, both to some special interests who profit greatly from our current addition to fossil fuels and obviously like the status quo in that regard, and even honest, well-meaning individuals who perhaps feel threatened by the projected impacts of climate change and would like to believe that is either not real or greatly overblown. Unfortunately, there are disingenuous individual, front groups, and politicians who are more than happy to feed them that message.   Question: fjpickett 28 February 2012 4:00PM   What happened to the Medieval Warm Period?   Answer: michaelemann   Well, I&apos;ve written about it extensively. Scientists prefer the term &quot;Medieval Climate Anomaly&quot; because the globe wasn&apos;t uniformly warm, some regions (like a large part of the tropical Pacific) appear to have been cold, and the largest signal appears to be in rainfall and drought patterns, not temperature itself. You might check out my article from Science from a couple years ago, &quot;Global Signatures and Dynamical Origins of the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly&quot; available here.   Question: meepmeep 28 February 2012 4:17PM   How do you feel about losing out on the Best Picture to Million Dollar Baby?   Answer: michaelemann   It was tough. But I got over it.   Question: Hoggle 28 February 2012 4:03PM   Michael How do you think we can improve the education system in the US and UK to give future generations the chance to avoid the ignorance and stupidity of the average science-denier argument?   Answer: michaelemann   Well, I think we need to teach students by not just throwing facts at them (as we all too often tend to do), but also by educating them about the process of science, how it works, how science advances through the testing of hypothesis, and the intrinsically self-correcting nature of science. I talk about this quite a bit in the book. Only if someone understands how science actually works will they be in a position not to fall pray to the dishonest attacks that are being directed at science and scientists themselves (as my story attests to) today.   Question: mammuthus 28 February 2012 4:20PM   Dear Mike,What do you make of the recent Miller et al paper in GRL on a volcanic link to the &quot;little ice age&quot;?Bit of background here for those interested.   Answer: michaelemann   Its an interesting paper. I&apos;m a bit skeptical that the volcanic eruptions can have the multidecadal impact argued for in this paper. It depends very specifically on the ice and ocean dynamical responses present in that particular model, and this effect is not seen in the many other simulations of the past millennium that have been done. So, like all matters in science, it will be a matter of other scientists independently assessing the degree to which the hypothesis holds up in future studies. What is certainly true, as argued in the study, is that volcanic forcing is a major factor responsible for the cooling of the Little Ice Age (along w/ modest changes in solar output).   Question: RobinsonRM 28 February 2012 4:19PM   Mr Mann,Don&apos;t you think that a very good test of the validity of a proxy is that it matches the instrumental temperature record? Given this is the case, doesn&apos;t the divergence problem tell you that tree rings aren&apos;t a very good proxy for temperature? And given that this is the case, why attempt to hide the divergence?   Answer: michaelemann    Hmmm. I have to wonder if you read my earlier response. Nobody tried to &quot;hide&quot; the divergence problem (a problem with tree-ring maximum latewood density as used by Briffa and collaborators). There original paper was *about* the divergence problem! And as should be clear to anyone following the science, I myself have published analyses that detail potential biases in tree-ring proxy estimates. See my recent Nature Geoscience article: &quot;Underestimation of volcanic cooling in tree-ring- based reconstructions of hemispheric temperatures&quot;. Science is about truth. Nothing more. Nothing less.   Question: OPatrick 28 February 2012 4:27PM   In your earlier comment you suggested that water vapour itself might turn out to be a negative feedback - did you mean this?   Answer: michaelemann   Oh. Certainly not. The fact that water vapor is a positive feedback (with a feedback factor close to +2) is well established. If you point out to me where specifically you think I implied otherwise (????) I&apos;d be happy to respond.   Question: aphillips 28 February 2012 4:34PM   Dr. Mann,James Hansen is widely quoted as saying that climate-sensitivity is &quot;nailed&quot; at 3C by paleoclimate. What are your views on this?PS, loved the book.   Answer: michaelemann   Thanks for the kind words about the book. Jim is a great scientist, who has made substantial contributions to our field, and I never take anything he has to say about the science lightly. I am surprised if he stated this, as there is still a very vigorous debate within the climate research community about precisely how much constraint we can put on equilibrium climate sensitivity. In my own (somewhat expert) assessment I would suspect that the range is somewhere between 2-4C for the &quot;fast feedback response&quot;, but larger, for the long-term response where land surface and carbon cycle feedbacks fully kick in. but here especially there are many &apos;known unknowns&apos; and almost certainly quite a few &apos;unknown unknowns&apos;. As I remarked earlier, there is no reason at all to assume that uncertainty will cut in our favor. Indeed, there is more reason to be believe it will cut against us, because of the possibility of some very high cost albeit low probability impacts.   Question: lionelsacks 28 February 2012 4:40PM   As someone who did not cope well with the level of bullying that can occur in academia, between colleagues! ... I was deeply moved, reading your book by what you and others been subjected to. Being anti-science is one thing, but the violence that&apos;s involved in this debate is astonishing...What can be done to re-civilize the debate on climate change policy?   Answer: michaelemann   thanks for your comment. well sadly, I think it is symptomatic of something much deeper, at least in the U.S. Its part and parcel to the poisoning of our public discourse, where every issue seems to have to be construed as falling along partisan political divide, and immediately you have gridlock and stagnation when it comes to advancing policy solutions to read problems. Part of the problem is the loss, in our media, of an honest broker. It wasn&apos;t that long ago that, as legendary New York Senator Patrick P. Moynihan once said, &quot;you&apos;re entitled to your own opinion, but not your own facts&quot;. Unfortunately, it now seems that with climate change---and so many other matters of policy relevance--people seem to think they are entitled to their own facts. Sadly, much of that is evident even in some of the comments that have been posted here today. There seems to be a loss of good faith in the public discourse. And until we solve that problem, I see little hope for substantial progress in solving just about any substantive problem faced by society.    Question: PaulGButler 28 February 2012 4:45PM   Professor Mann,You refer here to the &apos;fast feedback response&apos;:I would suspect that the range is somewhere between 2-4C for the &quot;fast feedback response&quot;, but larger, for the long-term response where land surface and carbon cycle feedbacks fully kick in.Do we have a good idea of the timescale of this response? Can you point to the relevant research?Thanks, incidentally for taking part in this discussion   Answer: michaelemann   So many good comments &amp; questions, so little time left. I would refer you to the site &quot;RealClimate.org&quot; I co-founded. If you do a search on terms like &quot;climate sensitivity&quot; on the site, you&apos;ll turn up some really good backgrounders on this topic by Gavin Schmidt and others.   Question: Salamano 28 February 2012 4:48PM   Thank you for your consideration :) My sister-in-law had you in class as a student at UVA...My question concerns the &apos;loading the climate dice&apos; studies that are starting to pop up in the literature. What are your thoughts on the validity of such studies? In my view, it&apos;s either the methodology is uniformly applicable, skillful, and revelatory, or the methodology is flawed.For example, Stefan Rahmstorf&apos;s study showing the &apos;loading of the climate dice&apos; when it comes to attribution of the Moscow heat wave (y&apos;all discuss this at RC as well) ... What if his same methodology (or others like it) were to be applied to the extreme cold gripping Eastern Europe / Balkans this winter?Thank You.   Answer: michaelemann   Thanks. Please say hi to your sister for me. I hope she had a positive experience! Your question is a great one. Generally speaking, we expect the &quot;climate dice&quot; to be increasingly loaded towards more &quot;sixes&quot; (extreme heat) and fewer &quot;ones&quot; (extreme cold). Certainly, we see that for the U.S., where the incidence of extreme heat over extreme cold has doubled over the past several decades to where the records run 2-to-1 (in the absence of climate change, it should be 1-1). Last summer in the U.S. it was closer to 10-to-1. So we are seeing climate change in the collective rolling of the weather dice. W.r.t. the Moscow heat wave, the Rahmstorf finding was recently reaffirmed in an independent study using so-called &quot;detection-plus-attribution&quot; approaches by some scientists at Oxford. Now, the extreme cold during parts of the winter in Europe for the past few years is very interesting. I would have guessed that there was no particular connection to climate change. However, a number of recent peer-reviewed articles have argued that there may indeed be a connection: the loss of Arctic Sea Ice in the summer and the impact that has one the transfer of heat form the Arctic ocean into the overlying atmosphere in fall and winter, may be perturbing the jet stream in such a way that you get more frequent wiggles favoring northerly (arctic) air flow over parts of Europe during winter. But the jury is still out on this. That&apos;s what makes the science so interesting. There are real uncertainties &amp; controversies, and they have implications. Were that the discourse was over these issues, rather than the false debate we&apos;re still having in the public discourse about whether or not climate change is even real :(   Question: PietroMercurios 28 February 2012 4:08PM   Thanks for coming online to answer questions, Mike.Could you let us know how the, so called, &apos;medieval warm period&apos;, fits in to the great scheme of things, with regard to your work on Global temperatures and climate change? Have you any thoughts on the subject?I&apos;ve found some of the information on that particular period very conflicting and realise that not all the global statistics, or evidence, are in on that one, yet.It&apos;s one of those anomalies that deniers like to throw out as an example and its hard to counter.   Answer: michaelemann   Thanks for the question. Indeed, much of my recent work has focused on the lessons we can learn from the natural climate changes of the past millennium. I&apos;m particularly interested in the role of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to past changes in natural (volcanic+solar) radiative effects, and how this can potentially inform the still quite uncertain issue of how ENSO will be impacted by human greenhouse gas increases. Since ENSO has such a profound influence on weather patterns around the world, including the U.S. where it influences rainfall and drought in the desert southwest, and Atlantic hurricane activity. In the book, I talk about my interest in these sorts of questions, and how the &quot;Hockey Stick&quot; was really almost a distraction from the more fundamental science questions that drove our research on paleoclimate in the first place, more than a decade ago.   Question:thefandango 28 February 2012 4:47PM   MichealGiven that the term &quot;denier&quot; has obvious holocaust denial connotations, do you think that your use of that word is:1. unacceptable for a scientist to use2. one that could incite certain elements to violence against people who question the concensusOr do you consider it a reasonable term?   Answer: michaelemann   Frankly, I think those who complain about this are often just producing crocodiles tears. As someone who lost relatives to the religious persecution of the jewish people, I would be as sensitive to anyone if I really though the use of the term has anything whatsoever do do with the holocaust. I find that argument quite disingenuous if not downright dishonest. For those who are denying mainstream science, the logical thing to call them is &quot;deniers&quot;. they are certainly not &quot;skeptics&quot; and even &quot;contrarian&quot; doesn&apos;t always fit the bill. Given that some of the fiercest of our detractors have proudly declared themselves deniers (one such individual even wrote a book &quot;The Deniers&quot;) I find that this argument has no currency at all. I suspect its often used as a somewhat disingenuous ploy to get journalists and other commentators to grant the highly undeserved term of &quot;skeptic&quot; to those who are nothing of the sort.  And finally, Michael closed the discussion:  Well folks, hard to believe it is over. So many very good questions (albeit a few odd ones too), and I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t give justice to all of the deserving questions and commentary. Please do consider reading the book, where I go into great detail on a number of the matters raised in the discussion.It is in stock at Amazon in the U.S. as well as the U.K. You can also continue to follow me at facebook:http://www.facebook.com/MichaelMannScientistand at twitter (MichaelEMann).thanks again everyone for a wonderful discussion. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.Mike Mann ",

    "text": "This week in Tech Weekly with Aleks Krotoski we look at the perfect storm of litigation on the horizon for Google, why the BlackBerry might be saved by a boom for the handsets in Africa, will the next director general of the BBC be a digital supremo and rumours of a Steve Jobs biopic by Aaron Sorkin. Aleks is joined in the studio by the Guardian&apos;s technology editor Charles Arthur and digital media correspondent Jemima Kiss. Charles also meets the VP of Nook the e-reader device which services the Barnes &amp; Nobel book retailer. Charles discusses the technical specification of the soon to be released devices and if they can prosper against such giants such as Amazon&apos;s Kindle and Apple&apos;s iPad.",

    "text": "Education and evidence were on my mind a lot last week, which may or may not make me a good academic. I&apos;m a parent governor at our local primary school and we had a spate of meetings in the last few days. A training session, a committee meeting and a full meeting of the governing body. This is something I agreed to do a few years ago and even during the frenetic days of poring over early LHC data, I was also poring over key stage one maths results, SATs, pupil progress reviews, raiseonline and the rest of it. Not to mention rogue mushrooms in the nursery garden. We are amateurs, but I don&apos;t recognise the slackers Sir Michael Wilshaw is concerned about amongst our governing body. That said, the job is more important and demanding than I expected, and if there are poor governors around, OFSTED are right to be concerned. One thing which came up is that fact that the &quot;National Expectation&quot; for children at the end of &quot;Early Years Foundation Stage&quot; (i.e. children who are five years old) includes the ability for them to &quot;write simple sentences which can be read by themselves and others.&quot; The document can be found here and is full of sensible-looking stuff. But this demand is a rather high one. Some children will do it easily, some won&apos;t, especially given the spread in birthdays (some will be only just five, some nearly six - that&apos;s a 20% spread in ages, on top of wide intrinsic variations in the speed of development). I have no problem with children being encouraged to do this and many will breeze it. Many who struggle will breeze it six months later and zoom onward. Also they aren&apos;t assessed in exams, thank goodness. But this is a major raising of this particular bar and it may in some schools have a big effect on teaching. Cue visions of reception classes putting away the lego to practice writing about Cats Sitting on Mats. Now I don&apos;t know, maybe that&apos;s good. Maybe children who have that expectation put upon them age four and five go on to learn more later and have more fun, more options, more success. Or maybe they get stressed and kick back. Or maybe it&apos;s different for different children and you have to spot that. In Germany, school attendance isn&apos;t even compulsory until age six, and they seem to do ok. But then there are many other differences between Germany and the UK. The point is I don&apos;t know. And I am not sure whether anyone knows, or how I can find out. This is a change with potentially huge implications for children in schools, including the one my kids go to, and I can&apos;t find compelling evidence that it will help. Or even that it will not harm. Of course this leads straight into the business of Ben Goldacre trying to shake the whole thing up with this talk and report for the DfE. He proposes using techniques from science and medicine, especially &quot;Randomised Control Trials&quot; (RCTs) in some circumstances, to evaluate whether educational interventions actually work. He also acknowledges that this is not trivial to do and not applicable in all circumstances. This sounds horrendously uncontroversial to me. However, I live with someone who has a science PhD and is a qualified teacher. As she went through teacher training, I heard several rants to the effect that ideology-based evidence rather than evidence-based practice is rather widespread.  I&apos;m aware that&apos;s an anecdotal sample space of one person, but this response from the British Educational Research Association (BERA) isn&apos;t terribly reassuring. The tone of grumpiness at an outsider popping up to tell you how to do your job is understandable, but its implication that trials and evidence have been tried before (as outlined in a book from the 1960s referring to failures in the 1930s), that they don&apos;t always work, and that therefore they can&apos;t revolutionise practice now, is a bit disappointing. RCTs only became widespread in medicine in the later part of last century (the first one was published in 1948) and practitioners and researchers acknowledge it as &quot;a dynamic methodology, [...] its present and future are informed by its history.&quot;** Anyone under the impression Goldacre thinks RCTs are a panacea clearly hasn&apos;t read his &quot;Bad Pharma&quot;, and everyone should. Anyway I really hope that doesn&apos;t turn into a slanging match, even if Michael Gove appears to want to make the Marxist &quot;Blob&quot; his enemy within. Teachers and children deserve better than to be collateral damage in such a battle. Some reactions have been encouraging, like this conference perhaps, and I hope constructive engagement can survive the unhelpful polarisation. It would be great if we got an educational culture that is confident about demanding, obtaining and interpreting evidence, and routinely cites and respects it, even when it is uncomfortable or doesn&apos;t fit a political standpoint. Such a culture would be far more robust against political and ideological fashions. &quot;A culture...&quot; That&apos;s a vague sentence. Here are two examples of what I mean. Physicists do education too of course. We had a Physics and Astronomy staff meeting last week at UCL where we discussed admissions. We have had 20-25% increases in applications in both of the last two years. We are at capacity, and our current offer is AAA or AAB at A level, which is lower than many approximately equivalent departments. So why not raise our offer? Here is a big reason: we have evidence that students with grades below AAB struggle more with our courses than those who attain it but that having AAA or A*s makes no significant difference, on average. So if we raise our grades, we might not be selecting on ability to do physics, but on something else. And it might be bad, for example, for widening access*. Points to note in this example are firstly that the whole discussion was framed by the best evidence available, and secondly that I have no idea how you do an RCT on this. If anyone knows, do say. I don&apos;t think we&apos;d be allowed to. Physicists do politics too. A glamourous highlight (not) of last week was attending my first closed session of the CERN council, the body that governs the lab where I currently do my science. This is a rather political body. Every delegation sits behind the name tag of their country; many are not scientists and most are not particle physicists; national and European finances are big issues; and we were discussing the European Strategy for the next few years of particle physics, where conflicts of interest and other non-scientific factors abound. Nevertheless, the single biggest factors, which changed the ongoing discussion utterly last summer, were the discovery of a Higgs boson and the measurement of the third neutrino mixing angle. These are what have revolutionised my field - not the latest bright idea or political polemic. The data. And the future possibilities are dictated by available technology even more than by available money. Even CERN council is evidence based. I&apos;m not suggesting particle physics research as a paradigm for educational research. We particle physicists seem to be finding underlying laws which are widely applicable. There may be few, if any, of these in education. Also, protons are all identical, everywhere. Children are not. (Yes, I noticed.) I just offer them as examples of a culture where evidence is an integral part of any decision, even those where many non-scientific factors play a role. Massive changes in classroom practice should be driven by widely-accepted educational breakthroughs, just as massive changes in particle physics are driven by widely-accepted new results. If researchers and politicians are going to change teaching practice, teachers have a right to ask &quot;What evidence is there that this change will be an improvement?&quot; And they, the children and parents have a right to an answer. The answer might be along the lines that the evidence is inconclusive but there&apos;s a plan to improve and evaluate it as the change progresses. It might be that some things (e.g what historical facts need to be known, perhaps) are intrinsically political. But back to the initial example, is there evidence that pushing five year olds to write in sentences means they are eventually more likely to &quot;acquire the stock of knowledge required to take their place in a modern democracy&quot;? Is there evidence it harms them? Obviously performing an RCT on this would take a long time, but surely we ought to have some evidence, or a plan of how to acquire some, either way? If such things exist, they are not well cited in the policy. I know there are lots of teachers who want to base their teaching practice on evidence. This aspiration should not become collateral damage it an ideological war. lf Gove says he wants evidence, his challenge should be taken up. And he should accept that some of the results might not confirm his prejudices. How he reacts would tell you whether he really has children&apos;s interests at heart. * Not by coincidence since all universities are wrapped in admissions right now, one of my favourite bloggers recently discussed similar issues at Sussex. **Meldrum, 2000. Oh I wish that paper was Open Access. Jon Butterworth is Professor of Physics at UCL (where he has been known to teach undergrads and postgrads and knows it is nothing like teaching 3-16 year olds) and works on the LHC.

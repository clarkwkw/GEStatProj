The once-Teflon secretary of state seems to be more on the back rather than front foot these days, not helped by the well documented and thoroughly unpleasant activities of a few key advisers. Very bad politics on the part of someone who aspires to be a party leader, in my opinion. But it is the progress of his substantive reforms that, on closer examination, provide a textbook example of how hasty, over-promoted, ill-thought-through policies usually come back to bite. The short-term legacy of the Academies Act  not in the coalition agreement, pushed through parliament using a form of legislation previously reserved for combating terrorism, supported by the supine Liberal Democrats and supposedly a cure-all for the nation&apos;s education ills  is distinctly mixed. The original Labour academies mission is so diluted that the performance of academies is now no different from similar maintained schools and conversions have flattened out. The vast majority of schools in the country are still maintained but there is still understandable widespread concern about what sort of middle tier can hold schools to account in an increasingly fragmented landscape. Some schools have been supposedly freed from the dead hand of the local authority, only to find themselves subject to the corporate uniformity of expansionist, pan-regional pseudo-local authorities, otherwise known as academy chains, some of which are already under the DfE spotlight on quality grounds. Meanwhile the DfE has quietly announced that many new free schools will be delivered via local authorities  whose role in planning places should never have been doubted in the first place. The &quot;witch finder general&quot; process of forced academisation, which Rhonda Evans&apos;s recent film, The Parents, the Politician and the Carpet Bagger, clearly demonstrates is both arbitrary and unaccountable, is meeting fierce opposition and resentment in some communities and highlights the sheer hypocrisy of the &quot;big society&quot; concept trumpeted by the secretary of state and his boss. On the one hand, the coalition government is happy to give entirely new institutions to groups of parents and others who have little or no experience or education. On the other, parents who want a say in how their existing local schools develop are met with bullying, intimidation and are effectively told their views don&apos;t count. But it is not all doom and gloom. As I predicted in these pages back in 2011, sometimes things have to get much worse before they get better. The debacle over GCSE marking and reform of KS4 examinations has given birth to grassroots campaigning groups like the Headteachers&apos; Roundtable, whose work on an alternative rigorous and inclusive qualifications and assessment system is going on apace and continues to inspire. Surely it&apos;s only a matter of time before something similar comes out of the review of the absurdly named &quot;national&quot; curriculum, which a significant minority of schools now don&apos;t have to use. It is completely illogical that a failing school, converted to academy status, should get freedom in this area, while a good maintained school should not. There is such anxiety about the proposals for primary schools that some heads are openly speculating that the new curriculum has been made as unattractive as possible to try and nudge the bulk of non-converters across the line to avoid it, which, in itself, speaks volumes about the relationship between the DfE and professionals. A stimulating, creative curriculum that embraces knowledge and skills, is flexible and attractive enough to give schools some autonomy but, equally, makes them want to sign up surely isn&apos;t rocket science, but my strong instinct is that it needs to be devised from the bottom up rather than imposed from above. Meanwhile there are signs that in many areas schools, whether academy or maintained, are forming new relationships with each other and with their local authorities to avoid isolation or the predatory chains. It is evidence that people want community and solidarity rather than competition and the market. One fairly cast-iron rule of politics is that once the shine comes off politicians, it is hard to polish them up again. Labour opposition to Gove is still too vague and these &quot;green shoots&quot; are springing up in a rather haphazard way. But it is encouraging and revealing that much of the interesting thinking is taking place among the professionals, not the policymakers. Alternatives are taking shape, which, for the first time in decades of education reform, could mean the people lead the politicians rather than the other way round.",

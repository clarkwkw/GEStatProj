    "text": "Apple has removed claims that its new iPad has &quot;4G&quot; capability from its UK and other non-US online stores, after complaints that its high-speed mobile connection could not work outside the US.     'Cellular' has replaced '4G' in the mobile capability of the new iPad in the UK Apple Store    The UK Apple Store now describes the mobile-capable device as having &quot;cellular&quot; capability, rather than 4G. The latter offers superfast mobile connections at speeds of up to 100 megabits per second.  But in the UK there are no publicly available 4G networks, and those which are expected to come into service from the end of this year will run on a different frequency from those used in the US, where 4G (or &quot;LTE&quot;) networks are being deployed. That means the latest generation of iPad will not be able to hook up to them, though it will be able to connect using 3G and the faster HSDPA and HSDPA+ connections. Previously Apple had been reported to the UK&apos;s Advertising Standards Authority for including the claim that the new iPad, released in March, had &quot;4G&quot; capablity. The ASA had said it had had more than 40 complaints.     The Swedish online Apple Store still offers 4G, though compatibility is less clear    Similar complaints have been made in Australia and in European countries including Sweden, where the Swedish Consumer Agency had been planning to launch an investigation. The Swedish online Apple Store still offers &quot;4G&quot; capability, although none of the networks in Sweden is understood to be able to connect to the 4G/LTE functionality.",

    "text": "The decayed stump, with ragged pennons of loose bark, looks dead and useless, but it is a refuge, a city of slumber for small invertebrates. Behind a few strips which I pulled off to-day found the silken cocoons of sleeping pupae, few very young larvae, waiting for the opening of the buds, resting woodlice and centipedes, and one or two spiders with their legs gathered beneath their bodies. Against the decomposing wood, amongst the vegetable life of fungoid growth, merely sheltered by the bits of bark, they had survived the frost and eluded the eyes of the birds. Instinct led them from the living plants which would vanish during winter to the dead plant which would persist, and the brain-possessing birds had not had sense enough to pull off those frail coverings, an easy task, and find them in their refuge.",

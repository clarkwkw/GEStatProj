    "text": "Our second Apps Pitch comes from Swedish developer David Sjlander, explaining his Build Cars with Edward and Arthur children&apos;s app. What&apos;s your app called and what does it do? Build Cars with Edward and Arthur is a creative game where kids can create thousands of fun cars and then test-drive them on the race track. Depending on what parts you use the car will behave different when driving, you&apos;ll need better tires to splash through mud, bigger engine to go faster etc. While playing you&apos;ll collects stars that unlocks more car parts, and even additional race tracks with new challenges! You can also gain stars by building certain complete cars, or by building a very light car that can cross an old wooden bridge. This game is for children 3-7 years old. While the app does contain some text, it is designed to be played by non-readers. The goal for me was to create a game that parents will enjoy playing together with their children. What devices is it on, and what are your plans? It&apos;s currently available for both iPads and iPhones. I&apos;d be happy to create versions for other platforms but those platforms are a lot more complicated with lots of different marketplaces and screen sizes. What&apos;s the business model and why have you chosen it? The game cost $2, and has no advertising links, social media connections or in-app-purchases. I would probably get more money if I used in-app-purchases to unlock more car parts, but as a parent I don&apos;t like that model in games targeted at children. What&apos;s innovative about the app  what sets it apart? I&apos;ve put a lot of work in creating a game that is both creative and fun with quite advanced car-building, while still being intuitive for small children.  I also hope that both children and parents see all the work and love I&apos;ve put into the graphics. I tried to create something feels different from most iPhone games, and I&apos;m very happy with how the game turned out graphically. What&apos;s the competition  who else is out there in this area? There are lots of apps for children on the App Store but, only a few good ones. I&apos;ve got very positive reviews so far so I&apos;m confident that the game is good, but it&apos;s still a major challenge to break through the noise in the App Store. As a Swedish game developer you may get great reviews and sales in Sweden, but it&apos;s extremely hard to reach parents in other countries. Tell us more about the company behind it While I&apos;ve been building games for a long time, this is my first app of my own. I recently moved to the countryside on the Swedish island Gotland, and I guess the team consists of me and my two children. The developent basically worked like this: in the morning my four-year-old gave me assigments, like which new parts he wanted etc. When coming back from kindergarten he tested the game and hopefully gave it thumbs-up. He was a very strict project manager... What are your future plans? If there is big demand I&apos;m open to create more car parts for the game. In the future I&apos;d like to create more games with Edward and Arthur and develop their personalities a bit more than I did in this game. I originally created the characters for a children&apos;s book and would still love to see that printed. Both me and my children have lots of ideas of other games that we want to create!",

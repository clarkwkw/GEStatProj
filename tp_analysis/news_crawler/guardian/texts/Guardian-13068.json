    "text": "For the last four years, charities in the south west that need help with any aspect of their work have been able to look to Plymouth University academics for in-depth analysis of an issue, and then apply for a community research award to bring that same academic rigour and independent view to a challenge they might otherwise struggle hard to overcome.  Every year &quot;the university pledges 50,000 and the support of its academic body to at least five specific research challenges from the voluntary sector,&quot; explains Professor John Scott, Plymouth&apos;s pro vice-chancellor for research. The process begins with groups being invited to attend an afternoon of workshops to explore the issue in question: for some, it gets resolved, but others may choose to work with researchers who have relevant areas of interest to develop a submission for a Community Research Award. Winners are teamed with academic experts who help them work through the project in hand: the 23 award holders to date have been drawn from a range of sectors, from national charities to social enterprises and community groups.  The projects that ensue often leave a legacy, explains Scott: these have included changes to government policy; greater understanding of challenges faced by children with a parent in prison; better recruitment and retention of charity volunteers; better GP training on handling dementia; and a national project on &apos;sexting&apos; and e-safety tools for schools to protect children in the online environment.",

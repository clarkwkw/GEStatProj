    "headline": "G8's new alliance for food security and nutrition is a flawed project", 
    "text": "This weekend, the UK government will host a &quot;nutrition for growth&quot; summit in London. The meeting is expected to expand the G8&apos;s new alliance for food security and nutrition, a special initiative launched in 2012 to mobilise private capital for investment in African agriculture. We all agree that African agriculture is in need of support and investment. So it&apos;s good news, right? Sadly, no. The new alliance prioritises unprecedented access for multinational companies to resources in Africa. To access cash under the initiative, African governments have to make far-reaching changes to their land, seed and farming policies. For a disturbing read, take a look at the new alliance&apos;s co-operation frameworks with countries. Mozambique, for example, is committed to &quot;systematically ceasing to distribute free and unimproved [non-commercial] seeds to farmers except in emergencies&quot;. The new alliance will lock poor farmers into buying increasingly expensive seeds  including genetically modified seeds  allow corporate monopolies in seed selling, and escalate the loss of precious genetic diversity in seeds  absolutely key in the fight against hunger. It will also open the door to genetically modified (GM) crops in Africa by stopping farmers&apos; access to traditional local varieties and forcing them to buy private seeds. Already, under the guise of helping to fight poor nutrition in Africa, genetically engineered bananas and cassava are being tested  despite concern about their impacts, and the existence of better conventional varieties. Several countries have been asked to speed up the takeover of land by foreign investors. Ethiopia, for instance, will &quot;Refine land law, if necessary, to encourage long-term land leasing&quot; (pdf), while companies are already asking for up to 500,000 hectares (12.35m acres) of land in Ivory Coast under this scheme. Countless studies, including one by the UN special rapporteur on the right to food (pdf), have shown that large-scale land acquisitions and leases destroy the livelihoods and food security of thousands of communities, and that access to land (pdf) is essential for the right to food. This lends more than a touch of irony to the commitment by David Cameron, the UK prime minister, to address land grabbing in this G8 through the much-criticised land transparency initiative. Already, multinational GM seed, fertiliser and grain companies such as Yara International, Monsanto and Cargill have signed up to benefit from the new alliance, and six African countries  Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique and Tanzania  have signed co-operation agreements. Most of these have barely been subject to democratic scrutiny, and undermine African-led democratic initiatives to tackle hunger such as the Maputo declaration (pdf) to raise public spending on agriculture and regional agriculture policies in west Africa. No wonder the runup to this weekend&apos;s summit has been greeted by an outcry. Networks of smallholder farmers, pastoralists, indigenous peoples and environmentalists from across Africa have called the scheme &quot;a new wave of colonialism&quot; designed to secure profits and royalty flows out of Africa. Global civil society agrees. It&apos;s not as if there is a dearth of opportunities for G8 countries to reduce hunger. They could scrap targets for crop-based biofuels, which are linked to hunger by a growing list of bodies including the World Bank. They could follow the advice of the UK parliament to address overconsumption of meat and support services to smallholders. They could regulate investors to stop land grabbing. And they could fund the legitimate and democratic global governance space on hunger  the committee on world food security  instead of competing with it. But the new alliance marches on under the banner of &quot;investment&quot;. So there is a bigger question here  is all investment equal? No. The type of investment, where it comes from, and in which parts of the sector it happens, will determine whether we solve hunger or not. By focusing on corporate investment, Cameron is missing the point. Enabling smallholders to produce food for themselves and local populations is key. The majority of the African population continues to rely on agriculture as its main source of income and livelihoods, and smallholder food production is also key to food security. About 70% of the world, mostly rural populations, is fed by smallholders as opposed to corporate farming, which tends to focus on exports and rich markets. Pumping huge sums into corporate farming may also flop, judging by the failure rate of such ventures in Africa. Most importantly, smallholders are also the biggest investors in agriculture. According to the UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), in low- and middle-income countries farmers invest about $170bn a year  three times as much as all other sources of investment combined. This is where we need to focus: on policies that encourage farmers to invest more themselves. The new alliance is a flawed project. Continuing to pursue it will cast a shadow on Cameron&apos;s commitment to ending hunger.  Kirtana Chandrasekaran is a campaigner with Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

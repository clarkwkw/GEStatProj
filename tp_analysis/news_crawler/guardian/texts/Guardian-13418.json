    "text": "   Abubakar Kikambi Photograph: Abubakar Kikambi    From my experience, one of the major causes of domestic violence is poverty. If the man does not buy meat at home, if he does not buy a dress the wife expected, these things cause conflicts. If a parent does not have enough money to send all children to school, the easy decision is to take the boys and leave the girls at home. What I have done is to sensitise people about the advantages of modern farming as a means of fighting poverty. We encourage people to work extremely hard because if you are so busy, you can hardly get involved in violence. I have demonstration plots and I use them to promote farming. Fights come out of simple things. Another thing my neighbours can learn from me is I do not discriminate my children; my girls and boys are educated. Current government policies have helped to get women to participate in leadership and all structures from the village to the government. The women have been educated and know that they can do anything that men do. On local administration councils a third [of seats] has been reserved for women; but I think this affirmative action will soon end because people are so sensitised and women are equals. Our area MP is a woman; our district speaker is a woman. These seats were contested with men and won. I think world leaders can help, especially with poverty, because it is a major cause. If we can fight poverty, we can reduce domestic violence. People need to be educated and sensitised about how to get themselves out of poverty and how to avoid violence. You have to notice that many of our people are not well educated. If one is not educated, some of the things they do are akin to animal behaviour  like a woman hitting her husband because he did not buy meat, or a man hitting a woman because the food was badly cooked. High-level meetings per se are helpful; you can&apos;t help people if you are not interfacing. But for us to gain from them, we need to reach a certain level of integration in the global information age; people should be meeting in New York while we in my village have internet and can follow the proceedings. People should be educated so they can know what has happened in Germany or New York. A lot of the time meetings take place but the implementation systems do not work. But if we sort these out and we fight corruption so that the benefits can come down to the grassroots, these meetings can be helpful.",

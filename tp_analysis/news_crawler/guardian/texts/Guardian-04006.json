In fact, some at Yahoo now want Bartz back. 3D Systems CEO: We want 3D printing to be as big as the iPad &gt;&gt; VentureBeat  &quot;3D printing will be the canvas of the 21st century.&quot;  That&apos;s the prediction being made by Abe Reichental, the CEO of 3D Systems and biggest cheerleader of the Cube, his company&apos;s first 3D printer built with the mass market consumer in mind. While 3D Systems more or less created the industrial side of the 3D printing business, the Cube is its foray into a more fledging, uncertain side of the industry.  Reichental, however, is certain of his goal: To democratize creativity. &quot;My assertion is that everyone can be creative if you remove all the friction and intimidation,&quot; Reichental told VentureBeat at a press event in New York City.  [Honeypot Alert] (UPDATE) Active Exploit Attempts for PHP-CGI Vuln &gt;&gt; SpiderLabs Anterior  As you may have heard, some security researchers recently released information outlining a long-standing vulnerability within the PHP-CGI code. The short of it is that remote attackers may be able to pass command line arguments in a query_string that will be passed directly to the PHP-CGI program.   Disable CGI if you use PHP, first. AT&amp;T&apos;s Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket HD will not be released &gt;&gt; The Verge  In a conversation with Samsung&apos;s Ryan Bidan today, we learned that the company&apos;s Galaxy S II Skyrocket HD, announced at CES earlier this year, has been shelved. He explains that it simply didn&apos;t make sense in light of the Galaxy S III announcement, leaving the product &quot;orphaned&quot; in AT&amp;T&apos;s lineup -- it&apos;s hard to justify an updated 720p version of the existing Skyrocket with the S III on the horizon.   How does it happen that you announce a handset at CES when you must know the bigger successor will imminently be appearing? Either Samsung US or AT&amp;T wasn&apos;t fully informed. Not a cheap mistake to make, either. Google: if you can&apos;t fight &apos;em, buy &apos;em &gt;&gt; Wayne&apos;s World  Google is offering billion dollar checks to labels for blanket rights to their entire catalogs, according to highly placed digital music sources.  According to one source, &quot;Google has offered at least one label over a billion dollars for all the rights in every country for every piece of music and for every platform.&quot; This means that Google could potential be writing checks for a total of well over $5 billion, if they&apos;re crazy enough to actually go through with it. By comparison, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry&apos;s (IFPI), total revenue generated by the global recorded music industry in 2011 was $16.6 billion.   Isn&apos;t going to happen, though it might sorely tempt some labels. Problem for Google is that (if the report is correct) it has a slight air of desperation, which is never a good way to look in negotiations. Pirates beware: DVD anti-piracy warning now twice as fierce &gt;&gt; Wired.com  Hollywood and the federal government have partnered to create updated and even more annoying anti-piracy warnings that will be included in new home-release DVDs and Blu-ray discs beginning this week, the government said Tuesday.  The new warnings now have three scary logos intended to deter those who might violate copyright law by making a back-up copy, ripping a movie to a tablet-friendly file, uploading it to a peer-to-peer network or make illegal copies to send to military service members in Iraq.   Someone should do a study of how pointlessly bad ideas promulgate. Quite possibly these are simply there for legal reasons - so that in prosecutions there is no defence that &quot;I didn&apos;t see the warning&quot;. Still as backward as a window tax, though.

U.S. sales are bright spot for Nokia&apos;s Lumia &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  Though demand for Nokia&apos;s new Lumia smartphones has been spotty across the globe, the Lumia 900 continues to sell reasonably well in the U.S. Retail checks conducted by Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt suggest that the device is the second-best-selling device at most AT&amp;T stores, after the iPhone.

    "text": "They say games are getting harder and harder to separate from reality, but this may be taking it a little too far.  In a report on BBC news last week, a reference to the UN&apos;s Security Council was accompanied by a large graphic on the screen next to presenter Sophie Raworth. The problem is, the UNSC icon depicted had nothing to do with the Security Council  in fact, it was the badge of the United Nations Space Command, the military agency depicted in space shooter Halo.  Viewers quickly spotted the error and the icon was replaced in later editions of the bulletin. A spokesman said: &quot;BBC News makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of all images broadcast. However, very occasionally mistakes do happen. Unfortunately an incorrect logo was used during a segment on last week&apos;s News at One bulletin and we apologise to viewers for the mistake.&quot; But of course, YouTube has a clip of the original report:            The channel can at least &quot;console&quot; itself with news that it is not alone. As discovered by tech site Venture Beat, the CanAsian Times has the same logo in its own story about the Security Council.",

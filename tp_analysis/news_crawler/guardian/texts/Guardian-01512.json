    "text": "Uniform intervention Michael Gove has made no secret of his belief that blazers and ties are the key to educational success. But residents of Totnes, Devon, couldn&apos;t have been more surprised to hear that the education secretary has voiced strong opinions on plans to introduce uniform at their local school. According to the internet radio station Totnes FM, Gove personally backs the move to introduce uniform at the King Edward VI community college. In fact, he is quoted on the radio station&apos;s website as saying: &quot;It is no coincidence that many of the best-performing state schools have proper school uniforms. If a school, such as KEVICC in Totnes, does not have a uniform, I would urge it to reconsider its policy.&quot; His comments have left parents, some of whom are campaigning against the plans, bemused. One, who did not wish to be named, told Education Guardian: &quot;The rumour is they [the school] want to introduce blazers and ties, Michael Gove-style. We just don&apos;t understand why he&apos;s so interested in what is going on at our school and talking to an internet radio station about it.&quot; The Department for Education says the comments were made to Totnes FM owner David Parsley, who previously worked for News International (as did Gove) at &quot;a private breakfast event&quot;. A spokeswoman said she did not believe Gove had intervened in the running of the school. &quot;The secretary was asked for his view and is perfectly entitled to give a view as the head of education in England.&quot; King Edward VI community college isone of just a handful of schools in the country not to have a uniform. Its headteacher, Kate Mason, who has previously defended the school&apos;s policy on the matter in Education Guardian, did not respond to our requests for comment. A-level reality check Some maths A-level students were panicked last month after being faced with a seemingly unanswerable exam question. Some of the same pupils had been affected by an impossible question on a maths AS exam paper last summer, for which the OCR exam board was forced to apologise. The January A2 mechanics paper, also set by OCR, contained a question that required students to calculate the distance a car has to travel before reaching a certain speed. But some students claim the way the question was worded was confusing. One posted on the Studentroom website: &quot;All in all, the question didn&apos;t make much sense...&quot; Another said: &quot;I thought the exam boards would have gotten their act together this time round; if there is actually another mistake it really doesn&apos;t reflect well on OCR.&quot; One teacher says: &quot;Some of the students who sat last month&apos;s mechanics paper were affected by the mistake on last year&apos;s maths AS exam. So when they saw another seemingly impossible question, they just panicked.&quot; A spokesperson for OCR said the question in last month&apos;s exam, which made up 7 points in a 72-mark paper, wasn&apos;t impossible, but admitted that the question was unrealistic, and had wrong-footed some candidates. &quot;There is no faulty formula within the question and it is certainly not impossible  the very low level of feedback from schools and candidates suggests that the scenario will affect few candidates, but our checking and monitoring processes will ensure that we pick up evidence of any confusion being caused and we will ensure that no candidate is disadvantaged.&quot; A model apprentice In the run-up to Apprenticeship Week last week, the public relations industry went into overdrive, clogging up journalists&apos; inboxes with offers of stories about successful stonemasons, plumbers and engineers. This year, one particular email, though, from a &quot;senior PR consultant&quot;, caught our eye. Ah yes, an offer of an exclusive interview. &quot;I&apos;ve found that one of my clients, a housing association, has a young, female apprentice, who is the only female carpenter in a team of 47, who is very glamorous (slim and blonde and attractive) and is one of triplets.&quot; The offer was from a firm that describes itself as one of the &quot;UK&apos;s leading public sector communications agencies&quot;. Still, it could be an honest mistake: perhaps the message was intended not for Education Guardian but for page 3 of the Sun?",

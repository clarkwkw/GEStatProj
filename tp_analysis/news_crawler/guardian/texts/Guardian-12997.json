    "text": "General Akamoto is angry. Fresh from being murdered by one of his samurai, he turns up for the afterlife to discover a massive queue to get in. So he does what any wronged general would, and recruits warriors to jump the queue and enact his revenge. Clearly Skulls of the Shogun doesn&apos;t take itself seriously. Yet lurking behind its irreverent story, stylish cartoon visuals and self-referential humour is a turn-based strategy game with surprising depth. Beginning proceedings with just four unit types, the game gradually expands over 20levels, allowing players to summon magical monks, recruit new warriors and level-up soldiers and, with battle a fast-paced affair, it makes for an addictive experience. Although tricky in places, seasoned strategy fans won&apos;t have any trouble. And while at times the game&apos;s control system can prove fiddly, with its clever, accessible single-player and robust multiplayer modes, Skulls of the Shogun is well worth a download.",

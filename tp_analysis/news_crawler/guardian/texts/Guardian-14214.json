    "text": "Baroness Northover failed again to answer the question I raised (Letters, 2 April): will the government join Norway in calling for the inclusion of abortion in all medical services in humanitarian settings and in urging the US to lift its ban on abortion services for victims of rape in war? US policy is crucial: by banning the use of US aid for facilitating abortion in any circumstances, it prevents humanitarian organisations that receive its funds from enabling abortions for victims of wartime rape. Of the major humanitarian organisations, only the World Health Organisation and Mdecin sans Frontires segregate US funds. When I was a minister three years ago, I would certainly have taken action if I had known there was such serious operational impediment to the use of UK humanitarian funds for the provision of abortion to women and girls impregnated through rape in war. Since she does know about it and is, plainly, decently motivated, will Baroness Northover now take action? Glenys KinnockLab, House of Lords",

    "text": "The most eye-catching feature of Nasa&apos;s proposed budget for 2014 is the inclusion of a future unmanned mission to capture a small asteroid and drag it into a stable orbit within the Earth-Moon system where it may be visited by astronauts. In the short term, the budget doubles Nasa&apos;s investment in searching for asteroids that sweep near the Earth, with the aim of identifying a suitable candidate by late 2016. By suitable, it must be 7-10 metres wide, in a reachable trajectory, and not spinning too quickly. Meanwhile, Nasa has huge challenges in developing the technologies to rendezvous with, capture and retrieve its quarry. These include new light-weight solar arrays and a powerful solar electric propulsion system, as well as the capture mechanism itself, possibly a large inflatable bag or cone with the equivalent of a draw string. One wildly optimistic timeline has the resulting craft launching in 2017, capturing its target in 2019 and returning it to trans-lunar space by 2021. The initial unmanned flight of Nasa&apos;s Orion capsule, designed to carry astronauts beyond the Moon, is due next year with the first launch of the SLS (Space Launch System) heavy-lift rocket not expected until 2017. All being well, they would come together to allow astronauts to visit and sample the relocated asteroid in advance of the goal that President Obama set in 2010 of sending humans to an asteroid by 2025. On the other hand, politics and austerity may yet scupper the entire venture.",

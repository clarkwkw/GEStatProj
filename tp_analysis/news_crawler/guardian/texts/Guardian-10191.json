    "text": "Black Ops 2 is out, you may have noticed. Some 319 Game stores throughout the country stayed open until midnight on Monday to serve the nation&apos;s most fervent fans. The flagship HMV store on Oxford Street held the official consumer launch event, with developers on hand to sign copies; the first person in the queue was media student Taylor Pelling, who had been there since 7 November.  Activision UK, meanwhile, held a big launch bash at the Bloomsbury Ballroom, inviting celebrities such as Jack Whitehall and Olympic gold medalist Louis Smith to indulge in the multiplayer mode. There will doubtless be mainstream news coverage throughout the day. Everybody knows what Call of Duty is, after all  the last Black Ops title, released in 2010, sold over 25 million units.  Can it last? That is no doubt the question Activision&apos;s shareholders will be asking as they greedily watch the sales ticker spin. There are, after all, signs that the massive sales, which have put Call of Duty above the box-office takings of any Hollywood movie of the last five years, are falling. Slightly. Industry reports suggest that last year&apos;s Modern Warfare 3 sold fewer copies than its predecessor  although it still managed to rake in $775m within five days of launch. The title has also had to fight for online multiplayer dominance with its close rival, Battlefield 3. Black Ops 2 doesn&apos;t have such a capable competitor this year  EA&apos;s Medal of Honor: Warfighter has come in for something of a critical mauling. However, there have been some very strong releases elsewhere, including Halo 4, of course, as well as Assassin&apos;s Creed III, stealth adventure Dishonored, RPG blaster Borderlands 2, and sci-fi strategy title XCom  most of them offering very different experiences to the now hugely familiar military shooter recipe.  And it is hugely familiar. Call of Duty has dominated the console sales charts for the last four years, with only the major sports titles (Fifa worldwide and Madden in the US), Halo and Grand Theft Auto getting close. It is up there with Mario, Pokemon, the Sims and GTA as a mega-franchise, boasting sales of more than 100 million. Some interesting things are happening in the industry now, though. We have the rise of indie gaming, spearheaded by Minecraft, which last month overtook Modern Warfare 3 to be the most played game on Xbox Live; smartphone and tablet devices are also continuing to cut in on the traditional games market, drawing attention away from retail console releases. We are also on the verge of a new console generation. Launching this Christmas, the controversial Wii U will be at the vanguard, but next year&apos;s E3 exhibition in Los Angeles will surely see announcements from Sony and Microsoft about their next machines. And in the past, new console generations have often led to disruptions in the software market, with previously healthy genres falling out of favour as gamers seek new experiences to test new architectures. The transition from the 16bit consoles to the PlayStation era, for example, saw the focus shift from traditional isometric RPGs and 2D beat-&apos;em ups to flashy 3D arcade conversions like Tekken and Daytona. The PS2 brought with it an age of third-person platform adventures and stealth campaigns as gaming demographics widened. All trends are cyclical, and statistically almost nothing survives beyond five years. The big Japanese publishers such as Nintendo, Capcom, Square Enix and Konami have managed to maintain interest in their legacy brands, but the likes of Final Fantasy, Super Mario, Gran Turismo and Street Fighter tend to be either radically overhauled to fit with the prevailing trends, or developed over periods of two or three years ensuring a welcoming fanbase when the release finally comes. The big challenge for Activision now is in ensuring Call of Duty can play an important role in showcasing the technology of the coming generation. Already, gamers are getting excited about relative newcomers such as Watchdogs, Star Wars 1313 and Team Bondi&apos;s Whore of the Orient. Can Treyarch and Infinity Ward make that difficult generational leap? Will we care about authentic military shooters next year or the year after? Black Ops 2 has done a couple of very telling things. By setting the game in the future, it has introduced CoD fans to the idea of science fiction; perhaps this will be something of a Trojan horse. Back in 2008, Infinity Ward, the creator of the Modern Warfare titles was rumoured to have been working on a sci-fi shooter before the fall-out with studio heads Jason West and Vince Zampella. Now those two are working on what appears to be, yes, a sci-fi shooter at their new place, Respawn Entertainment, but perhaps their old colleagues are also continuing their own plans in this direction.  The latest Black Ops also introduces a branching story and real-time strategy elements to its single-player campaign. Critical responses to both have been mixed so far, but there&apos;s an indication that Activision knows its corridor shooter formula is looking staid in comparison to open-world adventures like Dishonored.  Dominant genres rise and fall. JRPG, RTS, arena shooter, stealth shooter, gangster shooter... all have risen to the top, peaked and faded. It will be fascinating to see how Black Ops 2 fares this Christmas, but more importantly, how long it keeps its stranglehold on the multiplayer gaming scene, and where its fans are likely to look when E3 arrives and brings with it the promise of something entirely new, or at least not entirely 10 years old.",

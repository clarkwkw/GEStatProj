    "text": "Farlington Marshes has been used for grazing cattle ever since it was reclaimed from Langstone Harbour in the late 1700s, but during the winter months the cattle give way to vast flocks of migratory wildfowl. Dark-bellied Brent geese feed on eelgrass when they first arrive in Hampshire from their summer grounds in Arctic Siberia, but by early November the eelgrass beds have been exhausted and they turn their attention to the reserve&apos;s lush pasture. The geese are predictable in their choice of feeding sites, with more than a thousand birds plucking away at the grass, nipping off the tender tips with their stubby bills. Small gaggles break away to join the peroxide mohicaned wigeons paddling in bomb crater pools, formed during the second world war due to an unintentional act of habitat creation by the Luftwaffe. The sky is overcast. Colour seeps out of the landscape, leaving it bruised in tones of grey and brown. To the west a pillar of smoke rises from the Portsmouth incinerator, while to the north articulated lorries and cars thunder along the A27. The geese maintain a constant guttural gabble as they feed, contact calling to their nearby family members. They seem oblivious to the surrounding urban sprawl and unconcerned by our presence on the sea wall path, but I notice that sentinel birds on the periphery of the flock are ever watchful. Suddenly a Labrador freed from its lead slips under the fence like quicksilver, plunges through the drainage ditch and bounds towards the flock. The sentinel birds fall silent. Heads up, necks extended skyward, they signal a warning. A surge pulses through the flock. There is a beat of trembling silence, then whoosh, they erupt into the air in a thrash of wings. As the geese rise and scatter a skein flies directly overhead, so close that I feel the rush of air on my face from the downbeat of their pinions.",

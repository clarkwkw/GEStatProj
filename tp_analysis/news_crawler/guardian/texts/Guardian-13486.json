The intention is different, the methods are different, and a baby free from mitochondrial disease has nothingto do with the design of appearance, or any characteristics otherthan the presence or absence of such debilitatingand life-threatening disease. In the UK, the amount of compensation payable to egg donors is limited - unlike in the US, where foolish individuals may choose to pay apremium. There is little if any advantage to be had from using eggs donated by Ivy League students, and any purchasers who think otherwise areignorant of genetics.

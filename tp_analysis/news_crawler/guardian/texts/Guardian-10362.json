    "text": "When, if ever, does one stop being an academic? Is it a case of once a doctorate always a doctor? In a world of increasing self-publishing, whether of blogs, websites, e-books or physical books, does the traditional definition of academic still stand? I would argue the term is no longer restricted to those who have a university job, but is now relevant to a broader constituency. An old paradigm has shifted. Academics no longer have to be in an ivory tower lecturing, writing peer-reviewed articles or even attached to a university. There are historians who have abandoned PhDs but written books, enthusiastic &apos;amateur&apos; historians whose knowledge of their field would put dons to shame, and degree-less journalists who present whole TV series on history. When I read a comment under a Guardian article by someone with a &apos;mere&apos; BA in history describing himself as a professional historian, I found myself feeling rather huffy. Surely one needs at least a PhD to use that label? Can I still call myself a historian, given my day job and the fact I haven&apos;t been to a conference on my subject for more than a decade? If I&apos;m honest, the desire to pursue a PhD in history came out of my sheer lust for books. My fantasy of a professorial room came from the realisation that I needed a job to accommodate my ever expanding library. Writing a doctorate was a way of fulfilling my twin ambitions: to have lots of books and to write a book. The years I spent shut away in archives and libraries researching early modern Polish witchcraft trials were a privilege. As the stories of men and women long dead came alive in the record books, I grew to resent leaving the peace and quiet of the reading rooms. And as a student at Warsaw and Oxford universities, I certainly felt like an academic. But it was a selfish existence. I loved teaching and developing courses on &apos;the history of the devil&apos; (who wouldn&apos;t?) but I didn&apos;t want to teach general history all year round. Nor did I want to move from institution to institution on fixed term contracts. Already in my early thirties, I craved social and financial security. So, despite having delivered papers at international conferences, organised seminars and published research, I chose to leave academia. I now work as equalities officer at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers. The job allows me to use my existing research skills, as well as gaining knowledge in many new areas. But I am still in thrall to my first love, and in the evenings, at weekends and during annual leave, I become the &apos;secret academic&apos;. Snatching time to work when my young son is asleep is not a problem. My partner is also an academic outside academia and understands that I&apos;m not being anti-social. A fellow doctor, he has published several textbooks and a scholarly monograph, so talk around the kitchen table is often of synopses, pitches and other such writerly matters. Whereas we used to spend Saturdays together in the British Library, now we do shifts, alternating between playground and publications. Still I cling on to my identity as an academic, bolstered (in my mind at least) by being in the middle of the publishing process. Awaiting the report of my anonymous reader, I wrote two reviews of recent books on early modern witchcraft, keeping my hand in and getting my name out there before my own book, Witchcraft in Poland 1500-1800, is published. There&apos;s no doubt that publishers like to see affiliations  the &apos;independent researcher&apos; tagline does not always cut it. The advantage of operating outside the often bitchy world of formal academia is that reviews of your work do not depend on whose student you failed at a viva, or someone else&apos;s bitterness at not giving a keynote speech at a conference you organised. Once the thrill of seeing my own book in all its physicality has waned, will I still be an academic? I am deeply inspired by CJ Sansom and Dr Philippa Gregory, better known as historical novelists. And this time I am going straight for the book option too. No titles, no vivas, no professorial room. Writing history without footnotes. Academics outside academia: promoting yourself  Keep on eye on books you can review  you won&apos;t always be paid, but you will be read  Social media is a must  spend time on Twitter, Facebook and blogs (your own or other people&apos;s)  Don&apos;t forget JiscM@il and other relevant listservs connecting scholars to their peers Dr Wanda Wyporska is equalities officer at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers  read her writing blog and follow her on Twitter @WandaWyporska.

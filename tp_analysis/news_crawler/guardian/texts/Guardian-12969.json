    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Silhouetted against a set of serene multi-coloured sunsets and introduced only by a lonely paragraph or two of text, NightSky is an unusually atmospheric and beautiful set of physics puzzles that involve rolling a ball from left to right across the screen. Levels often bring new rules and challenges  sometimes with a few words of explanation but often without  as you learn to interpret the starkly drawn landscape and mechanical contraptions that help you manoeuvre your oddly personable little ball to the end. There are vehicles to drive, gravity to invert, and a button that lets you stick to sloping surfaces more effectively, but all these are mutable, turning themselves on and off as circumstances dictate. The puzzles are exquisitely simple, with solutions always directly in front of you even if it&apos;s not obvious at first glance how a traversal would even be possible. There can be moments of frustration when two particularly fiddly sections fall within the same checkpoint, but it&apos;s largely a delightful journey.",

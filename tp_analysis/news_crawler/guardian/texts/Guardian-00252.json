    "text": "A biologist who came up with the idea to release small, non-lethal cane toads into the wild to teach snakes and lizards a life-saving lesson in bush tucker has been awarded the 2016 prime ministers prize for science. Rick Shine, from the University of Sydney, has led the world in cane toad research, and successfully taught quolls and goannas not to eat cane toads by feeding them sausages made from cane toads. After eating a non-lethal dose of cane toad poison, the predators learn not to eat large toads that will kill them. Cane toads are a rampant introduced species that kills predators such as quolls and snakes when eaten due to poison in the amphibians glands.

My science doesnt have lots of big machines with flashing lights and it doesnt have much technical jargon. But I think what it does is show us how we can conserve an absolutely unique resource, Shine said. Shine will share the podium on Wednesday night with Michael Aitken from the Capital Markets Cooperative Research Centre, who produced software that has made stock markets fairer and more efficient, winning him the 2016 prime ministers prize for innovation.           Research teaching animals to avoid eating cane toads wins top science prize    Aitken and his team created software that captures two million stock trades per second, enabling rapid analysis of markets. He then created a system called SMART that detects fraud, and is now used to watch over global stock markets. The team is now using the same strategies to examine health, mortgage and other markets. One of the more important opportunities here relates to the efficacy of health intervention itself; this requires an evidence-driven approach to identify which treatments deliver improved quality of life to consumers and which dont, Aitken said. Australias chief scientist, Alan Finkel, who led the judging panel, praised the winners.   Related: Science is back! To help educate quolls about cane toads. With sausages | First Dog on the Moon    Science, and follow-on innovation, represent our path to that future; from cutting-edge research, to the development and commercialisation of new products, through to the dedicated teachers who inspire our next generation, he said. The prizes recognise outstanding individuals from all of these fields. But more than that  they recognise the importance of these groups working together with the community to reach Australias best future. Five other awards will be presented at the prime ministers prizes for science on Wednesday, sharing in a total of $750,000 in prize money.  Colin Hall from the University of South Australia will receive the prize for new innovators for developing a manufacturing process that will allow manufacturers to replace components made from glass  in white goods, cars, aircraft and spacecraft  with plastic, making them lighter and more efficient.  Kerrie Wilson from the University of Queensland will receive the Frank Fenner prize for life scientist of the year. Her work has provided the evidence-base for conservation decisions by putting a value on clean air, water, food, tourism and other benefits that the natural environment provides. Richard Payne from the University of Sydney will receive the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year for re-engineering peptides from ticks, bacteria, and leeches to create new drugs for strokes, tuberculosis, and malaria. Suzy Urbaniak, a teacher at Kent Street senior high school will receive the Prime Ministers Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Secondary Schools. She developed a program called the Centre of Resources Excellence (CoRE), which treats the classroom like a workplace, and the students as scientists. Gary Tilley, a teacher at Seaforth Public School, will receive the Prime Ministers Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Primary Schools. He has mentored young teachers at his school, and helped train maths and science teachers at Macquarie University. ",

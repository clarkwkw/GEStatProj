    "text": "For a first-time visitor to the Electronic Entertainment Expo in LA, there&apos;s just one word to describe the experience: overwhelming. For three days each June, the games world  from publishers, developers and industry publicists to retailers, we media types and, now, bloggers  descends on the Los Angeles Convention Centre for a glimpse at what will be released over the next 12 months. Actually, overwhelming doesn&apos;t really do it justice. The show is spread over two massive halls at the convention centre  West and South. And the two halls are a five-minute walk apart, which means that visitors get plenty of exercise. The West hall is dominated by the big three  Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony. Nintendo, of course, is showing off the new Wii U console, which should be in stores before Christmas (the company is yet to reveal the release date). The Wii U games look terrific  particularly Nintendo Land, New Super Mario Bros U, Lego City: Undercover and ZombiU. Disappointingly, Nintendo would not be drawn on the specs of the new unit, so we don&apos;t know yet just how powerful it is, or even what media the games will come on (it does have a disc slot, so my guess is Blu-ray). The South hall houses many of the third-party publishers and developers  Disney Interactive, EA, Ubisoft, Activision, Bethesda and others  along with smaller indie developers and peripheral manufacturers. Both halls are a sea of people standing or sitting in front of screens with a controller in their hands. The South hall, though, feels more like a nightclub than an exhibition space, a cacophony of light and sound. It&apos;s where trailers for all the bigger, louder games  such as Crisis 3 from EA, Assassin&apos;s Creed 3 from Ubisoft, Devil May Cry from Capcom and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 from Activision  can be seen on massive screens above the booths. Of course, the hardest thing to do at E3 is play games. Many of the bigger titles  such as Halo 4, God of War, The Amazing Spider-Man and Beyond  have long queues of eager gamers lining up for a quick play. The biggest surprise of the show is the booth babes, surely an unnecessary anachronism in 2012? A booth babe row sprung up this week over a tweet from Asus at the Computex technology show in Taiwan. No such silliness here at E3, but surely most people would agree that everyone attending the show is here for one reason and one reason only: the games. And driving home just how out-of-place these booth babes are is the fact that as you look around, you notice that almost half the people attending E3 are women  media, industry PRs and yes, even game developers. So here&apos;s a thought for next year, E3  for the sake of balance, how about some booth boys too?     Booth boys?

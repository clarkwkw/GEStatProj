    "text": "There are signs of the start of a revolution. For decades, education has subjected itself to fads that emerge offering hope and promise, but that just as quickly fall from favour with little explanation as to why. Those of a certain age are even convinced they can spot the same good idea coming round for a second time. Yet education may be changing its ways. Stephen Twigg is beginning to sketch out the Labour party&apos;s future education policy, recasting Tony Blair&apos;s &quot;Education, education, education&quot; as&quot;Evidence, evidence, evidence&quot;. Hisproposal for an Office for Educational Improvement, which wouldbe independent of government and, among other responsibilities, would quality-assure evidence, is a &quot;bigidea&quot;, and has the potential to redraw the boundary between education and politics. It wouldn&apos;t remove politics from education  nor should it  but it would mean that future education secretaries would have to justify the evidence underlying their policies in a way that no education secretary has had to before. Given the totally arbitrary way in which the present government uses evidence, an Office for Educational Improvement could start to rebuild trust. Other parts of the education service lay claim to promoting evidence. The Sutton Trust-led Education Endowment Foundation is to spend up to 200m over 15years making sure children from economically poorer backgrounds do better from the education system. Initially, the foundation was seen by some as replacement funding for schools in challenging circumstances. Yet the criteria are broader than the background of children in participating schools. The focus will be on scaling-up projects that are cost effective and replicable and to &quot;aspire to the highest scientific standards when evaluating the impact of innovative projects ... to include randomised trials and quasi-experimental methods&quot;. This is quite a shift in our approach to school improvement; if Twigg&apos;s new organisation will require politicians to work in a different way, the endowment foundation is demanding change from both researchers and teachers. It throws out a huge challenge to the academic community: in order to secure funds, research will have to show a direct link to raising standards in the classroom. Equally, it questions some attitudes held by teachers. Many believe that it&apos;s not possible to replicate pedagogic practice across schools. The argument goes that each classroom is unique and children are individuals who will respond in different ways. &quot;It might work for them but given my class it wouldn&apos;t work for me&quot; has too often been a response to someone else&apos;ssuccess. This view is perhaps understandable given the wealth of data on the impact that factors outside the classroom can have on a child&apos;s education success and the wish to treat each child as an individual. There is a fear that classrooms will be turned into laboratories and teachers into technicians if all that is asked of them is to replicate someone else&apos;s practice. Yet this isn&apos;t about off-the-shelf guaranteed success; it&apos;s about backing approaches that consistently show greater impact. It can&apos;t be acceptable for a teacher to ignore proven best practice, or, at worst, to continue with methods that are shown not to work, in the name of professional freedom. A move to evidence-based education will require teachers to be as robust in questioning the way they make decisions in their classrooms as it will call upon politicians to be open as to how they develop policy. For too long the question as to whether teaching is an art or a science has been a polarised debate. It is both  and the skill of the teacher is in deciding when to use which. I don&apos;t underplay the need for further innovation in education but we have an improving schools system with many successes. The challenge is to find a way to spread these throughout the system. This will need the ambition and skill to put evidence at the centre of the decision-making process both in Whitehall and in the classroom. Twiggand the Endowment Foundation are in different ways pointing in the same direction.",

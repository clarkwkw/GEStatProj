    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Released more than a year ago in Japan, Ni No Kuni has benefitted from a staggeringly long localisation process, possibly most evident in your beguilingly undiplomatic sidekick, Drippy. Easily the Welshest videogame character in history, he calls good things &quot;tidy&quot; and his favoured exclamation is &quot;knickers!&quot;. Taking in two parallel worlds and the sort of jaw-dropping vistas familiar to fans of Studio Ghibli (who worked alongside developers Level-5 to perfect the animation) this is an adventure that surpasses its occasionally mundane mechanics with characters and scenery that possess extraordinary levels of charisma. Your quest to save the world is closely linked to hero Oliver&apos;s mission to bring his mother back to life, a job that gently tugs at the heart strings while bringing a shade of originality to the familiar themes of almost all Japanese role-playing games. Grand in scope and gorgeous to look at, Ni No Kuni is a thing of absorbing beauty.",

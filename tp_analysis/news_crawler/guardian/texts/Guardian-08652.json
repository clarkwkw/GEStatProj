    "text": "Young journalists have to work hard to be taken seriously, the boyish writer and commentator Owen Jones warned students on Tuesday. &quot;Sometimes I get people asking me if I&apos;m doing the paper round.&quot; He was one of the guests at the NUS-Amnesty student media summit in east London. The event was designed to help student journalists pick up useful advice from figures in the industry. It&apos;s tough to get a start in journalism these days. The journalism industry has shrunk considerably over the past decade, with a study conducted in 2010 estimating a 27% to 33% reduction in paid positions. Applications to undergraduate journalism degrees were down 18.95% this year, according to statistics from Ucas. This compares to a 7.5% drop in applications to university in general. The slump in the journalism jobs market means advice is more welcome than ever. BBC special correspondent Sue Lloyd-Roberts talked about her experiences of foreign reporting in places such as Bosnia, North Korea and most recently Syria, where she had to use disguises to get across the border.     Eva student journalist Photograph: Guardian    Eva Chaideftos, 22, a law student at King&apos;s College, was inspired by both the speakers and the audience. &quot;I&apos;m still trying to figure out my interest in journalism, but everyone here is so committed and ambitious. It&apos;s an extraordinary profession and the day has been so eye-opening.&quot; Despite difficult conditions in the media job market, many attendees were still optimistic.      Aileen Duffy Photograph: Guardian    Aileen Duffy, 17, from Gloucestershire said she realises it&apos;s a very competitive industry but you should keep trying despite knock-backs. &quot;If I sit back and do nothing, then no-one will know. If there weren&apos;t any reporters, none of the serious issues would come to light,&quot; said the second-year college student. Jones highlighted the challengers of young would-be reporters: unpaid internships, the decline of local newspapers and the expectation of employers that you will have completed an expensive education. But he said there were also many opportunities, citing his career as an example. &quot;The rise of social networking [offers opportunities], particularly Twitter which gives a platform to aspiring student journalists.&quot; Jones started a blog only last year, and it came to the attention of an editor after he started tweeting his articles. Many of the speakers talked about the need to communicate the stories of marginalised people and those suffering in conflict areas. Andrew Carter, a freelance documentary-maker who has helped to produce films for Unreported World, said: &quot;I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s significantly harder to get a job now. It&apos;s just about persistence, stubborness. &quot;Resources and money will always be an issue. But we have to focus on the continuing importance of what we do.&quot;     Guardian students sign up banner  ",

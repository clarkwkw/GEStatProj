    "text": "Deep puddles ripple and swirl around each of the standing stones which make up the prehistoric Nine Stones Circle on Bodmin Moor. Set on a slight rise of ground between the bogs of Redmoor and Watery Marsh, this ancient site is overlooked by the Ridge, where cairns and tumuli have long been despoiled and used as a source of building stone. In 1889 the antiquarian AH Malan was invited by Mr Rodd of Trebartha Hall in the Lynher Valley to investigate the hilltop cairn that his men were dismantling. They were carting away stones for a new wall being built around a plantation and Rodd was curious to discover if the core of this solidly built relic contained a burial cist. Nothing obvious was found. Today the tumbled cairn and a hollowed-out mound, with its attendant gnarled and leaning hawthorn, are blasted by the south-west wind. On the intervening land splashy depressions reflect blue sky, and lower down a heron flaps upstream from the flooded ford below the mire. On the opposite side the turfy slope is green with moss and strewn with a &quot;clitter&quot; of granite boulders and worked moorstone. Miniature quarries, once excavated with hand tools, brim with water and, on the rocks, waterlogged tufts of moss gleam like emeralds against the afternoon sun. From Fox Tor, rain sweeps across higher moors to the north-west, beyond the A30 trunk road. Here the trig point (323 metres) is backed by a rainbow with its southern arc plunging towards Bathpool. Towards the sun, clumps of grass and withered gorse cast dark shadows. Beyond the undulating skyline, a herd of cattle shelter near Greymare Rock; snipe dart towards the watery bottom by Rushyford Gate and ponies have moved nearer Carey Tor. Deep ruts converge on the exit from the moorland and the farmsteads within enclaves of pasture are scattered with the remains of medieval settlement and hut circles.",

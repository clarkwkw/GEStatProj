    "text": "Vast sums are about to be spent on improving access to university. It&apos;s the bonus from higher student fees. But will it be spent effectively, so as to unblock the clogged arteries of social mobility? I fear not. Instead of helping bright but disadvantaged school students to achieve the qualifications needed to enter the best degree courses, the cash will go mainly towards recruitment incentives designed to give individual universities an edge in undergraduate marketing. It could be so different. It&apos;s a silver lining of higher fees that universities must spend some of their extra fee income on improving access. According to last month&apos;s annual report from the Office for Fair Access (Offa), by 2015-16 some 758m will be spent each year on access measures, representing 28% of fee income and a massive increase on current spending. But the signs are that not enough of this money will go on the key outcome that really makes a difference: raising pupil achievement. Already Offa has reported that &quot;access has not improved at the most selective third of institutions&quot; where top grades are essential. Instead, in 2012-13, the vast bulk of access funds will go on bursaries or fee waivers. These are, in effect, inducements to those already planning to apply to higher education to opt for one university over another. Indeed, just last week, Oxford University launched a 300m scheme of financial support for undergraduates from poorer homes. That is fine, but it won&apos;t help a single bright but disadvantaged youngster to achieve the grades needed to get into Oxford in the first place. It is only outreach  starting with school students well before GCSEs and tracking them through to A-levels  that will really affect social mobility. Yet the funds earmarked for outreach are tiny compared to the sums allocated to bursaries and fee waivers. This is a scandal. And it must be the right sort of outreach activity. There is an easy test of what is effective. As Richard Gould, director of the Villiers Park Educational Trust, told a conference this month, it is only working if substantially more of those students targeted get the exam results needed to win places at leading universities. As he points out, raising aspirations through campus open days, school visits, better advice and information is fine, but achieves nothing unless the young people get the necessary qualifications. There are a few good university-run outreach schemes  for example, Sheffield&apos;s Access to Medicine  but most focus on one-off events to inspire students to aim for university. There is also anecdotal evidence that the new funds are increasingly being eaten up by hiring more staff for already large university access teams. By contrast, the Villiers Park Educational Trust (of which I declare an interest as a trustee) does deliver on fair access. The charity&apos;s scholars programme works with students from years 10 to 13 from poorer backgrounds, offering a cohesive and ongoing programme of school-based mentoring, master-classes, residential schools and, crucially, advisory support within schools. The aim is simple: to ensure students get the grades to win top university places entirely on merit. Of the current year 13, over three-quarters have received conditional offers, including many at leading universities such as Oxford, Bristol, Nottingham, Southampton and Warwick. Most of the rest are either taking a gap year or have won top-level technical apprenticeships. In short, Villiers Park has shown that the right outreach, starting young, working with schools, focusing on achievement, works. Its success was confirmed by an independent evaluation by Sussex University. But, despite the money now sloshing around in access departments, it has proved almost impossible to get universities to fund scholars programmes in their areas (with the honourable exception of Bath University). Yet without external funding the programmes cannot expand. Could this be because the universities see no guarantee that these young people will end up at their campus? Are universities more concerned with boosting their own numbers than improving fair access more generally? Universities might argue it&apos;s not their job to raise achievement in schools. But successive governments have failed to grasp the nettle of helping bright, disadvantaged pupils and the main social mobility tool, the pupil premium, primarily targets low-achieving students. So, by quirk of policy, it is the universities that are sitting on a cash-pile earmarked for fair access. Until they put more of that money into outreach schemes, with proven and measurable outcomes in terms of higher pupil achievement, social mobility will remain blocked.  www.mikebakereducation.co.uk",

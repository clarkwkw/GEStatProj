The Kyoto protocol, the world's only binding climate agreement, expires at the end of 2012 Photograph: Katsumi Kasahara/AP       Gore delivers an opening speech at the ministerial conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in Kyoto, western Japan, December 8, 1997. Two decades ago, at the 1992 Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro, countries joined an international treaty, UNFCC, to co-operatively consider what to do against global temperature increases and the resulting climate change, and to cope with its impacts. The highest body of this UNFCC is the conference of the Parties (COP), which comprises representatives from nearly 200 countries and meets once a year  Photograph: Katsumi Kasahara/AP       Environment ministers Dominique Voynet, left, of France, Angela Merkel, centre, of Germany, talk with an unidentified delegate as they wait for a session to begin in Kyoto, December 11, 1997.

Bush was meeting European leaders to discuss the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which was signed by former vice-president Al Gore on behalf of the US, but never ratified by the Senate. In late March 2001, Bush announced that the US would withdraw from the Kyoto protocol, and later in June said that instead of committing to the protocol standards, it would combat global warming in other ways Photograph: Wolfram Steinberg/AP       Activists clad in polar bear outfits hold a banner in the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo, 16 February 2005, to celebrate the Kyoto protocol, which took effect that day with the support of 141 nations Photograph: TORU YAMANAKA/AFP       UNFCCC executive secretary Yvo de Boer (left) breaks down in tears next to UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon (centre) and Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (right) during the 2007 climate talks in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. Ban Ki-moon expressed his disappointment about the lack of progress and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan. After almost a fortnight at the Bali negotiations in December, as talks hit their umpteenth buffer, de Boer had to be led away from the chamber in tears, and became known as the 'crying Dutchman' Photograph: Mast Irham/EPA       A woman works on a visual update with reflections, comments and explanations set up in the Bella centre at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, 14 December 2009.

The talks descended into disarray after developing countries reacted furiously to leaked documents showing that world leaders would be asked to sign an agreement that hands more power to rich countries and sidelines the UN's role in all future climate change negotiations Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images       Behind-the-scenes negotiations between world leaders at the Copenhagen climate summit on 18 December.

Bickering over the fate of the Kyoto protocol cast a cloud over talks on future climate action, with Japan putting its foot down and refusing to extend the treaty named for its ancient capital Photograph: Omar Torres/AFP/Getty Images       Informal consultations including US climate negotiator Todd Stern (fourth from the left) and Chris Huhne, the UK energy and climate change secretary. The UN climate talks in Cancn were delicately balanced between a positive outcome and a 'car crash' because of the divide between rich and poor countries over the future of the Kyoto protocol, Huhne said at the time Photograph: IISD       Members of environmental groups take part in a protest march in Cancn  Photograph: Roberto Escobar/EPA/EPA       Then Indian minister of environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh (left), and Chinese minister and China's chief climate change official, Xie Zhenhua (right).

Negotiators agreed to start work on a new climate deal that would have legal force and, crucially, require both developed and developing countries to cut their carbon emissions.

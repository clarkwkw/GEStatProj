    "text": "    At the BSA Science Communication conference this week, I was invited to speak about science policy, under the title &quot;All hail to the chief&quot;. Except, I think science involves way too much hailing already. I&apos;m not about to start bowing to Sir Mark Walport, just because he&apos;s the government chief scientific adviser. Neither do I think we should be worshiping Science Media Centre CEO, Fiona Fox as a &quot;high priestess&quot; (Roger Highfield&apos;s rather telling nickname for her). Science today, and the way we share it with the rest of the world, is based on layers upon layers of deference. We spend our lives crawling up to senior scientists, and those who pay them, sitting and waiting to be told what to think. We shouldn&apos;t be so complacent. The Government Office of Science and Technology, the Science Media Centre, journalists, museums, school curricula and a host of other systems for sharing science act as filters for scientific information, choosing which is the most important and useful. This is what makes them so useful, but such choices are always going to involve more than simply science and we need to recognise this.  We&apos;ve been here before. It&apos;s the critique of the so-called &quot;deficit model&quot; many of us have been dancing to for decades. The deficit model, if you&apos;re lucky enough not to have come across the term, assumes science has the knowledge the public are deficient in, and that many of our social ills will be solved if we all listened to the experts. It&apos;d be a nice idea maybe if science, the media, policy or people were that simple, but they&apos;re not (I talked about similar issues in my Radio Four piece on scientific literacy last year). The deficit model sticks around partly because it feeds scientists&apos; social status, implicitly underlining their powerful position as people who get to define what counts as important, true, reliable knowledge. Stephen Hilgartner put it well back in 1990, saying such top down approaches implicitly provide the scientific establishment with the epistemological right to print money.  Something we don&apos;t appreciate enough though is that also serves the handmaidens of the deficit model  science communication professionals, less powerful scientists, many science &quot;fans&quot;  offering them some social status by association. Play into a game of hierarchies, and even if you don&apos;t get to the top, you get to climb a bit. Pierre Bourdieu, in his classic sociology of the university campus, Homo Academicus, talks about the way students are happy to submit to the idea that they are inferior to senior academics because doing so earns them subsequent admittance to a distinguished club of graduates. I think we can see similar patterns at work in terms of the way academic ideas are shared outside of universities too.  Less cynically, top down models also stick around because scientists do, genuinely, have special ideas and information to share. We pool our resources to allow a few people to cut themselves off and become experts in particular subjects. We do this so that they might feed back their knowledge and we can, collectively, try to make a better world. We should listen to them.  As David Dickson wrote in 2005, factual reporting of science can be socially empowering for audiences. It&apos;s worth remembering this. Political systems of scientific advice in government are built partly for this reason too, to make best use of scientific expertise. I don&apos;t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and lazy critique of science is not just silly, it can be dangerous (if you&apos;ve never read Merchants of Doubt, do). But valuing expertise in society doesn&apos;t mean you have to unquestionably listen to those labelled as expert. Earlier this week, George Monbiot neatly pulled out Mark Walport&apos;s suggestion that a prime function of his role in government was to ensure science translates to economic growth. Firstly, is that really Walport&apos;s job? Really? Secondly, even if it is, what kind of growth are we talking about? To serve which parts of society? To go in what directions? Drawing on what resources? These are very serious questions with multiple possible answers, many of which science will be a necessary, but insufficient part of. We should be invited to access, or at least view, these less than simply scientific decision-making process.  When I was looking into the Big Bang Fair last term, I learned that volunteers were briefed not to get pulled into debating &quot;politics&quot; of arms dealing or the fossil fuel industry, lest it distracted from the science. I&apos;ve since heard similar briefings have been issued for science events running over the summer. It&apos;s also a line I heard all too often when I worked at Imperial College.  It&apos;s bullshit. Simple bullshit. Politics doesn&apos;t distract from the science. An over-emphasis on decontextualised science is used to distract from the politics.  It is often assumed science is somehow above political issues, but just because disinterestedness is an aspiration doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s true in practice. It can be hard to spot ideologies you&apos;re part of, so decent public engagement  which is honest about the uncertainties and arguments in science and actively invites questioning  can help science uncover itself more clearly. This is vitally important, because if you don&apos;t recognise how routinely political science is, you just get played by those who do.",

What behaviour is that? Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult male spotted pardalote, Pardalotus punctatus, a small passerine that is endemic to Austalia. The pardalotes are also known as peep-wrens (a name I really like). They are very small, brightly coloured birds with short tails, strong legs, and stubby blunt beaks. These Australian endemics form their own little family, Pardalotidae, that comprises just four species, all in the genus, Pardalotus.  The spotted pardalote is one of the smallest birds in Australia. Their range encompasses the fertile areas from the eastern coast, around the southeast, and through the southwest corner of that continent. They are fairly common but are not often seen because of their habit of spending their days high in the tops of gum trees, feeding on insects. They are more often heard than seen, and in fact, their call and song is probably the best way to identify them.  The spotted pardalote is sometimes known as the &quot;headache bird&quot; because of the continuous &quot;sleep-may-be&quot; call that it gives during the breeding season. During breeding season, this cavity-nesting species often digs holes in the ground to nest in -- very unusual for arboreal passerines -- when tree hollows aren&apos;t available.  Here&apos;s a video of a spotted pardalote (it looks like the female) leaving its nest burrow after feeding its chicks. The song of this species is included in the video (uploaded 31 October 2010):             Visit 3977wampy&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].

    "text": "G8 leaders gather in Lough Erne next month for the first UK-hosted summit since the 2005 Gleneagles meeting  when commitments (pdf) to double aid to Africa by 2010, scrap unaffordable debt and spend 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development assistance were made. What&apos;s happened since? How have development debates changed? What&apos;s at stake for developing countries at this year&apos;s summit? We&apos;ll ask these questions and more in this month&apos;s Global development podcast, and we want your thoughts and comments to help shape the debate. We&apos;re recording in front of a live audience at the Guardian in London  see details below if you&apos;d like to attend. Tax, trade and transparency, central pillars of David Cameron&apos;s &quot;golden thread&quot; narrative, will be high on the agenda. But what can the G8 do to tackle these issues? What role could the G8 play in pushing forward a fairer global tax system and helping poor countries mobilise domestic resources for development? And with the rise of China, and the increasing importance of the G20, how relevant is the G8 today? The Make Poverty History (MPH) campaign mobilised millions of people to march and take action before the Gleneagles summit. This year the IF campaign is calling for policy changes to address the root causes of hunger  but so far it&apos;s been a &quot;mere shadow&quot; of MPH, says the Guardian&apos;s economics editor Larry Elliott, who says G8 leaders are &quot;under zero pressure to deliver&quot;, with Cameron &quot;treated with kid gloves by most of the UK development charities&quot;.

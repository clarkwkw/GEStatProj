    "text": "We&apos;ve tried and, even with Ian Sample, some ping-pong balls and a bag of sugar, understanding what the Higgs boson is  and how scientists will know if they&apos;ve found it  is proving difficult:    	 	 	 	 	    Can you help us break it down into even simpler terms? If you&apos;re a scientist, a teacher or a physics fan with a knack for explaining big ideas and small particles, we&apos;re imploring you to help.   How would you explain Higgs boson to a seven-year-old?  Which analogy best explains what&apos;s happening at Cern? Can it be described in 200 words? Share your explanations in the comments below and tell us what you think the public need to know about Higgs boson. Imagine you&apos;re answering this question from reader allanclare on our live blog from Cern:  As if speaking to a small child, could somebody please explain the benefits/importance of this? I&apos;m not being cynical, I&apos;m genuinely interested.  We&apos;ll be asking our Twitter followers on @guardian for their #Higgshelp too.",

    "text": "As the teaching year draws to a close and I finish my first year as a lecturer, it doesn&apos;t feel very long ago that I was juggling job applications, part-time university sessional work and hourly-paid private tutoring, all while trying to do unfunded research and find ways to attend conferences that I didn&apos;t know how to pay for. Those times were not easy. For me, it was being open to jobs outside the UK that helped me carve my way through. In September, I made the move to Kuala Lumpur to take up a post at the University of Nottingham&apos;s Malaysia campus. After a whirlwind month of planning, packing and goodbyes, I left Birmingham International with an overweight suitcase jammed full of 19th-century novels, with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. As I had expected, learning how to be a bona fide lecturer while adapting to living in a new country isn&apos;t easy. The tax system is, quite frankly, baffling, and the Kuala Lumpur roads seem to have been planned on purpose to make you get lost. But what I hadn&apos;t fully anticipated is just how much I&apos;d love teaching in a different cultural environment, or how rewarding and thought-provoking I&apos;d find the experience. Teaching 19th-century literature often involves unlocking a culture that many undergraduates find alien and far removed. If this is true in Britain, where most students have studies the industrial revolution at school, visited a Victorian museum as a child, or even just walked around a city with recognisably 19-century architecture, then it is much more so in the Malaysian classroom where, by and large, students haven&apos;t. Rather than being an obstacle, this unfamiliarity has enriched my teaching: the students here have helped me to see my subject with fresh eyes. Their thoughtful, and often illuminating, responses to a literary and historical culture which is entirely new to them have made me more aware of the cultural assumptions that I bring to the texts I teach. It&apos;s something of a commonplace to observe that literary criticism says as much about the critic as it does a text, but I hadn&apos;t been fully aware of how deep this runs  even at the level of deciding which texts and topics to teach. Putting together a module does, of course, reveal something about yourself, and what you believe is important about your subject. This is my first experience of teaching in a truly multicultural classroom. We have a high proportion of international students, and Malaysia itself is incredibly diverse in terms of religion, ethnicity and cultural heritage. As the year progressed, this has made me critically consider my module design and, at times, the whole enterprise of teaching 19th-century British literature in a former British colony, riddled as the texts often are with notions of British political, cultural or religious superiority. But this is in itself something important to discuss  as my students commented, you lose something by stepping around uncomfortable issues. And the texts have wider resonances. Not every student loved Victorian literature, but it has sparked compelling, nuanced discussions about the way that fiction and poetry engage with subjects such as human rights, politics, nationhood, gender, education and relationships. Our close readings and interpretations have been enhanced by the sheer range of cultural backgrounds and life experiences that we&apos;ve collectively brought to the table. A research project on the poetry of religious faith and doubt, for example, particularly caught the students&apos; intellectual imagination; their search for spiritual poetry elicited sophisticated readings of Hopkins, Arnold and Christina Rossetti alongside less canonical poets such as Francis Thompson and Augusta Theodosia Drane. Thinking about how metaphors and conceits were used to depict the religious experience opened into a comparative discussion about how spirituality is represented in literary texts from non-British and non-Christian cultures, and how this, in turn, relates to the languages and cadences of different sacred texts. I can honestly say that I learned as much as I taught. One student commented on the value of studying writers with whom there is no immediate sense of identification or shared belief. Not only was it of academic interest, she said, but &quot;we change as people due to conflicts&quot;. This is what happens every time we open a book  we come into contact, sometimes conflict, with convictions, ideas and world views which are not our own. This is what makes literature such a fascinating subject, and what has made this year&apos;s teaching such a privilege.

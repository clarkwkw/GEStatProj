    "text": "The traditional Fable games, with their complex RPG mechanics, aren&apos;t the sort of titles you&apos;d expect to find using Microsoft&apos;s Kinect motion sensor, a device best known for its simplistic dancing and sports titles. But for Fable: The Journey, developer Lionhead has tried to prove the two can work together, but with mixed results. The title puts players into the role of reluctant hero Gabriel, who must drive a horse-drawn cart and use magic to defeat an ancient evil. So far, so Fable. But here, the game is entirely on rails and plays a little like an interactive movie, with pretty visuals, a strong story, impressive voice acting and the series&apos; trademark British humour. But the real star is Gabriel&apos;s horse Seren, who you&apos;ll develop a genuine bond with throughout the adventure. Unfortunately, despite the developer&apos;s best efforts, the Kinect controls don&apos;t always work. Whereas one moment deadly accuracy is displayed when shooting a goblin-like Hobbes from afar, the next might result in missing an immense troll staring you in the face, annoyingly leading to you being killed for no discernible reason. While Fable: The Journey is by no means a bad game, you can&apos;t help but feel it would have been far better with a controller.",

    "text": "Standing beside the Cadboll doocot it is not difficult to realise why this is regarded by many, including myself, as the finest of all these extant vernacular buildings in the north. It was built around 1700 and the weather-beaten stone walls are a mosaic of colours, red, green, brown and gold. They support the single pitched roof capped by crow-stepped stones on the top edges. The design is known as a lectern cote because of its shape, and on the roof is a line of six access holes with two more on the east gable. These holes would have enabled the pigeons, called doos, to reach the 400-plus nesting chambers inside the doocot. In the time before refrigeration these birds would have given the major landowners access to food, namely meat and eggs, all the year round. However, it was mainly the young pigeons, the squabs, that were harvested. One unusual feature of this doocot is that it supports a large weathervane, depicting a man in hunting dress, breeches, high boots and a tall hat. It was erected in 1863 and is supposed to be a likeness of Crawford Ross, who was a tacksman  a type of tenant. Among many other duties, he was sometimes responsible for calling the clansmen to arms. The reason for the commemorative weathervane was that Crawford Ross also altered the inside design of the doocot by building another ceiling, thus dividing the doocot into upper and lower chambers. This reduced the number of doos  necessarily, as they were ravaging the local crops of some tenants. The birds in such doocots were originally derived from rock doves that used to breed along the coast; when the doocots went out of use, the doos went feral and eventually successfully bred with the rock doves. It is now possible that there are no pure rock doves in the UK. Let us hope that such doocots survive to remind us of the past.",

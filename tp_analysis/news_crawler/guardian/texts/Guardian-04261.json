    "text": "The fact that tuition fees have been tripled twice in recent years can be a recipe for confusion. Professor Steven Cummins (Letters, 22 May) argues that the NUS is wrong to criticise the lack of improvement in student contact time since the three-fold increase in fees, and that the coalition should be blamed for simultaneously withdrawing teaching funding from universities. Although we agree about the withdrawal of teaching funding, my original comments about the use of tuition fees by universities in fact related to new research from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Report, 17 May) which showed time spent with tutors has not improved since the implementation of &quot;top-up fees&quot; under the previous government, and therefore prior to the coalition&apos;s funding policy taking effect. Top-up fees were, at the time, additional to increases in public funding for teaching, and the rationale given by ministers and universities was that they would be put to use in improving the student experience: the HEPI&apos;s report and other evidence now gives us cause to doubt those claims. The impact of the coalition&apos;s three-fold increase in tuition fees on the student experience has not yet been felt  the first cohort will enter university this autumn and we will be closely monitoring the impact. The NUS vigorously opposed both the introduction of top-up fees by the last government, and the rushed and unfair three-fold increase in fees and teaching funding cuts forced through by the coalition. We will continue to oppose the rationale of marketisation; the same cannot be said for most vice-chancellors. Liam Burns President, National Union of Students",

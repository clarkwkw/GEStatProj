    "text": "What is facebook.com? This question doesn&apos;t really need answering, but what is interesting is how this social network uses cookies on other websites  especially if you do not have a Facebook account. What information is facebook.com tracking? The Facebook tracker that appears in our data is not for targeted advertising. In fact, Facebook explicitly told us it has no need for such a thing  the information its users willingly volunteer on the platform is a far richer resource for advertising. The tracker we are seeing in our data is, most likely, from Facebook&apos;s &quot;social plugins&quot;. These are tools that link back to Facebook in some way, such as the &quot;like&quot;, subscribe&quot; or &quot;recommend&quot; buttons. They appear on other websites through the use of &quot;iframes&quot;, a very common way of embedding content on to a web page. In order for this to load, Facebook&apos;s servers will know the page, the time and date it was loaded and the browser IP address. According to the December 2011 Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) audit (PDF) of Facebook, the cookies that are set and the data required by these plugins can differ. If you do not have a Facebook account and your browser has loaded a facebook.com page, then no cookie is set when you browse a page with social plugins.  If you do not have a Facebook account but your browser has visited a facebook.com page in the past, three cookies would have already been set on your browser. One is for security purposes and the other two are used to track registration effectiveness. If a user later decides to create an account, the aim is to find out what convinced them to do it. This is done by recording the first and last Facebook pages the browser visited. If you have a Facebook account, you will have a cookie set on your browser containing a unique ID that relates back to your profile. If you have checked &quot;keep me logged in&quot;, the cookie will also record this. When you visit a page with a social plugin, it will check that cookie. If you are signed in, it will use your unique ID to show you how many of your friends have clicked on the like button and whether or not you have liked the page yourself. Controversy erupted late last year around this cookie, as it was discovered that a user&apos;s unique ID was not deleted when they signed out of Facebook and so could be read when a page with social plugins was loaded. Facebook says this has now been changed. Is the data ever matched to personally identifiable information? If you click on a Facebook &quot;like&quot; or &quot;share&quot; button, this is displayed on your Facebook wall. In order to do this, Facebook has to match this action with your account details. This is done through the log-in cookie. How is the data used? Is the data sold to third parties? Information about the social plugins you have clicked will be shown to your friends, both on Facebook or on the site that you clicked the button on. In its video introduction to social plugins Facebook says this is not shared with anyone else. Facebook say your information is not shared with third parties. If you add content to Facebook, you own the data. Due to concerns that Facebook may be using social plugins to influence its advert targeting, the Irish DPC tested web pages (PDF) with &quot;like&quot; or &quot;share&quot; buttons on them (p184-185). It concluded: - Browsing websites that had share buttons did not appear to influence the advertising targeted at a user. - Pressing the &quot;like&quot; button either on a Facebook page or on a page with a social plugin may influence the advertising targeted at the user.- The advertising targeting appears to be focused on particular Facebook pages and/or very specific keywords.- Browsing to a category of websites or interests (e.g. &quot;parenting/childcare&quot; or &quot;motorcycles&quot;) did not appear to have any influence on the advertising targeted at a user. What other ways does Facebook track? What information? Facebook lists all the ways it receives information about users in its Data Use Policy. How long is the data stored for on Facebook&apos;s servers and on the individual&apos;s browser? Data associated with your Facebook account is stored for as long as that account is active. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Facebook. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days.  Can Facebook give one example of how tracking genuinely benefits the people being tracked?&quot;We don&apos;t track people&quot;, says Facebook, adding that cookies are useful for: - Security and site integrity.- Optimising the way a Facebook page displays in your browser [by storing browser window dimensions].- Enabling a user to stay logged-in on a device they use frequently, such as a home computer.- Making it easy for users to sign in to Facebook  for example, by auto-filling the email field of the login form.- Recognising when a person is accessing Facebook from an unfamiliar device  this then enables additional security features.

    "text": "Forza fans, rest easy. Horizon may sacrifice real-world circuits and a motorsport focus, but the game&apos;s racing heart beats on with its exceptional driving physics moved into a sprawling open-world scenario based on the Colorado Rockies. And a gorgeous world it is, too, with stunning vistas and a day-night cycle creating frequent breathtaking moments. The story, based around the Horizon car festival, is largely forgettable and the character acting even more so, but it gives structure to progression in the game. More exciting are the point-to-point and mixed-surface events adding spice to the usual tarmac fare. The difficulty level is also more forgiving than Forza 4, with driver assists making the action more accessible for newbies. Turning them off makes cars handle like wet soap, but rewards with more points for close shaves with oncoming cars and destroying scenery, in addition to the usual drifts and overtaking. The car selection is also less expansive, but intentionally so, to encourage hanging on to vehicles for longer, squeezing every ounce of potential from the plentiful mod options. The result is a closer relationship with each machine (thankfully stopping shy of a Top Gear-esque infatuation) as you learn its idiosyncrasies while eating up the competition. There are also mini-games, such as registering high velocities on the speed cameras featured along major roads, along with arcade-style multiplayer battles that will ensure longevity but ultimately, Horizon will succeed through winning new fans by utilising the franchise&apos;s core strengths, reinterpreted here to great success.

    "text": "Having been privileged to see many spectacular wildlife scenes in various parts of the world, it came as a surprise to experience one from my own desk. Atthe beginning of April I placed a miniature camera and microphone in a nestbox about 15 metres from my studyand out of my sight. On 8 April thefirst moss came in (I didn&apos;t see how),initially covering half the base. From then on I was hooked, to the extent I had difficulty in concentrating on any writing. It turned out to be the work of a pair of blue tits and I watched, on a screen, their daily efforts on the nest. Generally only one bird would bring material but just occasionally both would be at the nest and they would chatter away to each other. It was as if they were commenting on the nest building. Most of the construction took place in the morning and at other times I would watch them through the window, mainly at the feeders hanging only a metre from where I sit. Or they would be looking for food in the large larch tree on one of the islands of the pond below me. I always knew when they were about to enter the nestbox as they scrambled at the entrance hole, and the sensitive microphone would pick up the slight noise. At last the cup with its lining of small feathers was complete, although it had taken the birds a long time as though they were not satisfied. Then the behaviour of the birds changed: the female would come in and shuffle around in the nest and, presumably, lay an egg. There seemed to be a very long time between visits but the incubation does not start until the last egg is laid. Each egg was immediately covered up and only when she finished laying could I see the corner of one. And finally, catastrophe: both birds were taken by a male sparrowhawk that frequents the garden.",

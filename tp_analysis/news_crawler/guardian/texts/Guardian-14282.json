    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Like Billy Hatcher (owner of an oversized egg in a long-forgotten Sega platformer), light-fingered raccoon Sly Cooper is a video game also-ran. His tales of comedy heists were so nearly great, it&apos;s lovely to see him back for another adventure. The script is witty, the animation solid and the cavalcade of mini-games never stops: a side-scrolling shoot &apos;em-up homage, remote control car sections, stealth, fighting and serving sarsaparilla to thirsty bar patrons are all in a day&apos;s work for Sly and his pals. In this outing they&apos;re travelling through time to rescue Cooper&apos;s ancestors  who all seem to have had their hands in the till  from prison. The mechanics are a bit clunky, lacking the feel and precision of Mario or the immaculate comic timing of Uncharted 3, but it&apos;s so full of new things to do your brow barely has time to furrow before fresh entertainment is wheeled in. In spite of its imperfections, Thieves In Time is a distinctive and charming little diversion.",

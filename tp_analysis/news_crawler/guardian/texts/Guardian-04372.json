    "text": "At last year&apos;s E3, Nintendo introduced the world to the Wii U, its high-concept replacement for the Wii. The world looked at its bizarre controller  now officially named the Wii U Gamepad  and thought: &quot;What&apos;s that all about  it looks like a tablet?&quot; Nintendo&apos;s shares fell. But we got our hands on it, played a bunch of tech-demos, and realised that it is a work of borderline genius which adds a new spin to gameplay. On Monday afternoon at E3, in cloak-and-dagger conditions on a Nintendo stand that was being constructed around us, we were treated to another hands-on session with the Wii U, this time in its final form and with some proper games. And we came away thinking that surely, this year, people will be able to get what it&apos;s all about. Because it might just be Nintendo&apos;s best console since the Super NES. Wii U Gamepad  the final iteration The most prominent feature of the Wii U  the console itself is small, anonymous and self-effacing  is that peculiar controller which, Nintendo announced a few days ago, will be called the Wii U Gamepad. It has mutated slightly in the period of a year, bringing considerable improvements. The final Wii U Gamepad is wider than the prototype, has two proper analogue sticks than can be clicked down is much more contoured at the back, and has a mysterious near-field communications area that Nintendo is being coy about right now. And there&apos;s a button marked TV that lets you use it as a TV remote. As with the prototype, it has all the buttons that you&apos;d expect to find on a Nintendo controller (including two large triggers with plenty of travel and a nice feel, shoulder buttons and so on), plus a front-facing camera, two speakers and a stylus for the touchscreen. It motion-senses, and positively bristles with every conceivable feature. But despite that, it&apos;s surprisingly light  just as well when you have to hold it up in front of your face, as some of its games demand you do. The newly added contouring provides natural, comfortable grip-points when you hold it conventionally with two hands, and a transverse rib down the back does the same when you grip it with one end facing towards the TV screen (and yes, it can accommodate both left and right-handers  you just point a different end at the screen accordingly). Versatility could be its middle name. NintendoLand The first game we played is called NintendoLand, and will be a crucial title for the Wii U as, the company&apos;s Tim O&apos;Leary explained, it&apos;s designed to fulfil a similar function to that which Wii Play performed for the Wii. That is, to introduce you to the Wii U&apos;s multifarious capabilities. Thus, it&apos;s a collection of mini-games, each themed around one of Nintendo&apos;s classic in-house franchises. It will comprise 12 games, although we only played three. The first was called Takemaru&apos;s Ninja Castle, and Nintendo showed a tiny hint of it at its press conference last year. To play it, you hold the Wii U Gamepad flat, with one end pointing at the TV, and if you swipe one or two fingers across the screen towards the TV, you will propel a throwing star towards the screen, in the direction in which you&apos;re pointing. So you have to aim the Wii U Gamepad precisely at the cute, almost cloth-textured ninjas that appear on screen, and swipe with sufficient speed for your throwing stars to reach them. They throw stars back at you, but if you&apos;re on the ball, you can launch throwing stars that take them down in mid-flight. If you hit ninjas with successive stars, you activate a bonus multiplier.  This proved fresh and addictive to play, although it did take a bit of technique-honing: for best results, a long but quick swipe is required; if you do short, frequent swipes (which is tempting because your supply of stars is unlimited), they usually fall short. Takemaru&apos;s Ninja Castle was deceptively simple, in that the almost trivial nature of its gameplay masked hidden depths. Which more or less sums up the Wii U. Next up was Legend Of Zelda: Battle Quest. Alas, we didn&apos;t get to play a full-blown Zelda game, but this NintendoLand mini-game casts you and co-operative players as Link-like characters, in a recognisably Zelda-ish world.  It&apos;s designed to be played co-operatively with one player wielding the Wii U Gamepad and, in the case of our demo, two others using Wiimotes. Your characters move on rails, and whereas those playing with Wiimotes can wield them as swords, as in Skyward Sword, whoever has the Wii U Gamepad plays as an archer. Zelda: Battle Quest showed another key principle of the Wii U: the view on the screen of the person playing with the Wii U Gamepad was different to that shown on the TV screen for the WiiMote players. Again, you had to point the Wii U Gamepad to aim, except this time, you held it vertically, in front of your face with both hands. Launching arrows was a simple matter of pulling back on the right analogue stick, then letting go; when you ran out of arrows, you merely had to move the Wii U Gamepad to the horizontal, and they would automatically replenish themselves.  In the spirit of Zelda, there was a puzzle element; as well as taking out enemies before they got to your sword-wielding colleagues, you had to take out enemies and switches positioned on higher ground. If, for example, you hit a bird in the air, it would yield health-giving hearts for you and your colleagues. It fostered a lovely feeling of co-operation, felt completely different from Takemaru&apos;s Ninja Castle and was thoroughly immersive to play. The third NintendoLand game we played is called Donkey Kong&apos;s Crash Course. A single-player game for the Wii U Gamepad, it married the familiar arrangements of girders from the original Donkey Kong games with surprisingly rigorous physics, plus a knitted-and-sewn art style reminiscent of Kirby&apos;s Epic Yarn. Instead of playing as Donkey Kong, you control a contraption consisting of your Mii in a plastic bubble, above two wheels attached by springs. You have to negotiate your way from the top-left corner of the screen to the bottom right, by titling the Wii U Gamepad, which you hold vertically with both hands and letting gravity take its course. You encounter switches, which cause bits of rail to tilt and open new areas and which are operated by pressing and holding the triggers, and at one point, a helical bit of track which you wound around using the right analogue stick. There are plentiful checkpoints, and the rigour of the physics dictated that landing jumps wrongly would cause you to derail and fall off your springs (so you respawned at the last checkpoint). Another game which initially appeared laughably simple but proved quite fiendish  and very addictive. Batman: Arkham City Armoured Edition We didn&apos;t get to play the next game  instead we were shown a demo video  but it was quite a surprising one to find in a Wii U games demo: a specific to the console, much-tweaked version of Warner Bros and Rocksteady&apos;s Batman: Arkham City (possibly the finest thing ever to come out of Kentish Town). The video promised a large amount of Wii U-specific content, and controls which placed some of the more peripheral, and fiddlier, aspects of Arkham City on the Wii U Gamepad&apos;s touch-screen. Thus, you could touch icons of Batman&apos;s gadgets to equip them and, for example, there was a completely new touch-based mini-game to operate Batman&apos;s Cryptographic Sequencer. And there was a new meter entitled BAT Mode: when filled you could activate it, and Batman would kick arse twice as violently for a short while. We also saw a new move which let Batman launch silent takedowns from miles above his victims and, naturally, the remote-controlled Batarang was now piloted using the Wii U Gamepad&apos;s motion-sensing. Graphically, it was great  perhaps slightly better than on the Xbox 360 or PS3, but not significantly so.  With the Wii U, Nintendo will lag behind Sony and Microsoft&apos;s next-generation machines, but it has a crucial period to itself before they arrive, and at least, unlike the weedy Wii, it is in a graphical ballpark which third-party developers are used to occupying. New Super Mario Bros U The next game didn&apos;t really push the Wii U&apos;s graphics, mind  but it will please Nintendo-heads as it&apos;s a Wii U-specific side-scrolling New Super Mario Bros game. We played a bit of single-player  discovering a new power up called Acorn Glide, which comes in the form of an acorn, and gives Mario (or your Mii, which you can play as, as well as Luigi and various Toads) a cape which lets him glide; shake the Wii U Gamepad while gliding and he will do an extra boost-jump, but won&apos;t be able to glide any further. We also played New Super Mario Bros U in four-player mode  it can accommodate four people playing with Wiimotes plus another on the Wii U Gamepad. And that was pretty intriguing, because the player with the Wii U Gamepad was invited to get out the stylus, and tap the screen around his co-op colleagues, creating short-lived platforms they could use to reach higher levels or avoid attackers. Tap one of those so-called Boost Blocks again, and it turned into a Coin Block, which released a shower of coins when anyone landed on it. You could also use the stylus to distract enemies, keeping them away from your co-players, or put Boost Blocks underneath enemies to raise them out of harm&apos;s way. Not the most earth-shattering title, but playing with the Wii U Gamepad left you feeling satisfyingly God-like. Wii U Panorama View The final thing we got our paws on was a considerably developed version of one of last year&apos;s most eye-catching tech-demos, now officially dubbed Wii U Panorama View. It wasn&apos;t a game as such, but an intriguing collection of 3D videos, filmed using a technology that lets you look around their scenes as if you were actually there, by swinging the Wii U Gamepad around. The first onw we saw placed us in the middle of the procession of dancers at the Rio Carnival: as they danced past you, you could turn around with the Wii U Gamepad and watch their retreating backs. You could also zoom in with the right trigger. Another 3D video placed you upstairs on an open-topped double-decker driving through London, enabling you to twist around for a closer look at any of the myriad landmarks that caught your eye, and to scrutinise your fellow passengers. Cutely, Nintendo had filmed the same routes twice, once in the day and once at night, with the passengers seated in the same positions (although festooned with blankets at night). You could flip seamlessly between the day and night versions, which was impressive. Apparently, the camera used is a sort of globe containing five cameras facing in different directions, which provide overlapping images that can be stitched together. Clearly, this technology could be used to give games photo-realistic backgrounds, which is a mouth-watering prospect. Overall impressions While it would have been nice to have played a full-blown Zelda, Mario, Metroid or Donkey Kong game for the Wii U, such things weren&apos;t built in a day, and it&apos;s clear that the Wii U won&apos;t be arriving long before Christmas (Nintendo refused to be drawn on a launch date or pricing). But what we played confirmed our conviction that the Wii U will be a gameplay tour de force, constructed with sufficient ingenuity to bring what gamers crave above all else: new and distinctive gameplay experiences. All three NintendoLand mini-games we played were brilliant, and highlighted the console&apos;s unprecedented ability to shape-shift and support almost dizzyingly diverse types of games which, at the same time, don&apos;t feel like anything you&apos;ve played before. Whether they translate well into descriptions on paper, or even video, is a different matter. We&apos;ve said this before, and we&apos;ll reiterate it now: to understand the Wii U, you need to get your hands on it. Which is going to be a real challenge for Nintendo, even with its track record of previewing new hardware with massive roadshows. Nintendo, though, isn&apos;t interested in making things easy for itself  all it cares about is making gamers happy. And that&apos;s exactly what the Wii U will do.",

    "text": "     &quot;Ever since a monk called Mendel started breeding pea plants we&apos;ve been learning about our genomes. In 1953, Watson, Crick and Franklin described the structure of the molecule that makes up our genomes: the DNA double helix. Then, in 2001, scientists wrote down the entire 3-billion letter code contained in the average human genome. Now they&apos;re trying to interpret that code; to work out how it&apos;s used to make different types of cells and different people. The ENCODE project, as it&apos;s called, is the latest chapter in the story of you.&quot; For more information, visit: www.nature.com/ENCODE",

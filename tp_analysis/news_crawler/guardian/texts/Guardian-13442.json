    "text": "As the government announces that it wants to make apprenticeships the norm for students leaving school, we talk to two apprentices about why they&apos;ve chosen vocational training over a university degree. Billy Utting, 22, is an apprentice plumber I always wanted to do something practical using my hands. I didn&apos;t want to sit down at a desk and tap away at a keyboard because I like to stay active. After my GCSEs I got a job with my dad doing flooring work, but it didn&apos;t pay well so I packed it in. I didn&apos;t like being jobless so I decided to go to college in Lewisham. And that led to me getting on an apprenticeship scheme with Pimlico Plumbers. I was earning 200 a week when I was 17 and, because I was living at home, everything I earned was mine. As a plumber you can earn up to 60,000, so I knew there was a lot of potential in the job. I&apos;ve shadowed plumbers and learned on the job as well as in college. The apprenticeship can be challenging at times, but it&apos;s good work. Sometimes you go to a job and think  oh my God, what have I got here? I&apos;ve specialised in boilers and gas  I&apos;ve been trained to install radiators, boilers and cookers. I decided not to touch toilets too much. A lot of my friends thought: why do an apprenticeship when I could just get a job? But I&apos;ve done it the other way around  I&apos;ve looked at the bigger picture. And when I&apos;ve finished the apprenticeship there&apos;ll be a job waiting for me. Natasha Swan, 16, is an engineering apprentice at Rolls-Royce I&apos;m studying for a BTec in engineering at college  but alongside that I do practical work at Rolls-Royce. The academic side of it links up with everything we&apos;re doing on the job. We learn the theory behind the work we&apos;re doing: we might study forging or making moulds, but we&apos;re learning about why it works as well as how it works. And it&apos;s very diverse  they teach us life skills like business and communication, as well as engineering. This year we&apos;re leaning the basics  we get trained on how to use different machines and equipment properly. But next year we&apos;ll be going out into business and applying all the skills and information and knowledge we&apos;ve learned to making Rolls-Royce products. It&apos;s challenging, but not to the point where you want to give up. At school you get students who just cruise through and don&apos;t really care, but here everyone is really focussed and ambitious. I didn&apos;t hear about the position until just before the deadline for the application date. I thought I might as well go for it and as soon as I got here I knew it was where I needed to be. I had thought about going back to sixth form, but I realised the apprenticeship would allow me to carry on with my education and earn at the same time. A lot of my friends are in sixth form and, although they&apos;re learning, they&apos;re missing out on the practical side of things. My apprenticeship has made me grow up a lot and become more mature. Engineering might be seen as male-dominated, but everyone here has the same attitude towards work and it doesn&apos;t make a difference if you&apos;re female or not. And now I&apos;m hoping to go on to get a degree  as part of the apprenticeship scheme  and then work up as high as I can in the business. But I don&apos;t want to limit myself to one particular thing because any experience is good. I like variety  and that&apos;s what you get on an apprenticeship.  Natasha and Billy feature in a BBC Learning Zone series on apprenticeships being broadcast this month.",

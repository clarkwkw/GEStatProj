    "text": "Just over five months ago, former Guardian journalist Natalie Bennett was elected the new leader of the Green party, replacing Caroline Lucas, the UK&apos;s first Green MP. This Monday, Bennett joins us here to answer your questions on her record so far, and her vision for the party&apos;s future. How much progress has she made on her &quot;plan for leadership&quot;? How realistic is her ambition to have a Green councillor in every major town and city in the UK within a decade? And what hope does the party have of creating a credible platform and policy beyond environmental issues? Just post your question below, and Bennett will do her best to answer at 1-2pm on Monday 11 February. Please note any off-topic comments will be removed.",

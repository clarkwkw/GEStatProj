    "text": "I have a longstanding attachment to Silicon Valley, a place of innovation that often represents the best of free-market system. The tech industry&apos;s rallying on behalf of free speech in January, as it joined the Stop Sopa campaign to block legislation that would have censored the internet and thwarted innovation, was a proud moment. Yet, the valley often undermines itself with actions that demonstrate ethical shortcomings, and sometimes betray honest capitalism. Such has been the case in recent months with accusations and evidence  not new, in most cases  of shameful activities. They include the way US companies work with Asian manufacturers that are becoming better-known for shabby treatment of workers; anticompetitive behavior, including collusion against their own employees; and a longstanding willingness to create and sell tools of surveillance and repression. Apple, one of the most profitable and valuable companies in the world, is taking special heat based on several deeply reported stories in the New York Times and other media, on several grounds. Most notably, the company&apos;s offshoring of manufacturing has embroiled it in controversy over the working conditions at the Chinese-owned and -operated companies that actually make Apple products, especially its mobile devices. Apple says these arrangements are essential for it to remain competitive. The stories are grim, they don&apos;t implicate Apple alone. Indeed, virtually the entire tech industry now uses Asian manufacturing arms, and there&apos;s every reason to assume that this is an industry-wide situation. Meanwhile, documents filed in a 2011 civil lawsuit (pdf)  itself the result of an earlier settlement with the US Department of Justice  implicated Apple, Google and other Silicon Valley stalwarts in personnel practices that reeked of anticompetitive behavior. It seems that their leaders, including Apple&apos;s Steve Jobs and Google&apos;s Eric Schmidt, had a &quot;gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; to not poach each others&apos; employees  that is, recruiters from one company were barred from approaching workers at the others. The companies continue to deny any improper behavior, saying that their arrangements were about not &quot;cold calling&quot; other companies, and that employees were free  as if the companies could stop them  to solicit new jobs. But even heavily redacted material from the Justice Department case tells a damning story. One such document posted by TechCrunch  quotes an email from Adobe, saying that Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen and Apple&apos;s Jobs &quot;have an agreement that we are not to solicit ANY Apple employees, and vice versa.&quot; There is an ethical exemplar in this case. He&apos;s Ed Colligan, the former CEO of Palm Inc, who was allegedly approached by Apple to join the gentlemen&apos;s agreement. Colligan replied, according to the court document, &quot;Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other&apos;s employees, regardless of the individual&apos;s desires, is not only wrong; it is likely illegal.&quot; Defense attorneys contend such emails are being distorted by the plaintiffs in the class action suit brought by five software engineers, but Colligan&apos;s word &quot;wrong&quot; shouts out from this note. How could these otherwise brilliant and normally sensible business people think they could get away with such behavior?  Perhaps, it simply never occurred to them that they were doing anything improper  that if it was good for business, it was good, period. And the hell with the workers. Silicon Valley&apos;s top engineers are well-compensated, to be sure, but the way they were treated in this case speaks volumes about the attitudes of their bosses. Through all this, the tech industry has persisted in selling the tools of repression to the world&apos;s dictators. Companies note, fairly, that tools can be used for good or evil. But they could do much more to prevent their own products from being used for the latter. With these same technologies, they&apos;re also enabling increasingly pervasive surveillance societies, even in democracies. Tracking of internet users by government and corporate interests (often working hand in glove) has become part of everyone&apos;s expectations  a sad state of affairs, if you believe in privacy. The root of all these problems is the same: money. The technology industry is fiercely competitive. When survival and the bottom line rule all, the result is fairly predictable. I remain a big fan, in most ways, of the Silicon Valley and its global counterparts. In its role as a leading economic sector, the tech industry has an opportunity to help set standards of many kinds, not just technological or financial ones. I continue to hope that its leaders will think harder about the world they are helping to create.",

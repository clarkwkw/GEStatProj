    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view To solve puzzles in Scribblenauts you type in any noun you can think of to magic an item into existence, from bisque to electrocardiograms to aircraft carrier. You can also prefix nouns with adjectives, so if a dinosaur keeps eating you, changing it to a &quot;vegetarian tyrannosaurus rex&quot; renders it a threat only to shrubbery. As before, you control the hero, Maxwell, but this time you can also unlock various members of his extended family by helping them through whatever amusingly constructed scenario they happen to be facing. Using a more open-world structure than previous outings, you&apos;re free to go anywhere you want in search of starites, the game&apos;s effective currency, but the freedom is tempered by puzzles that are more to do with guessing what the game is thinking than the manic open-ended invention of the original. It works well, though, as does its reduced reliance on actually controlling Maxwell.",

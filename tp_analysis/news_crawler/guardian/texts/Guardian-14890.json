    "text": "On the 60th anniversary of the publication in Nature of three papers by James Watson and Francis Crick, and teams led by Rosalind Franklin and my late father Maurice Wilkins, it&apos;s easy to forget that in April 1953 just about no one in the world had heard of DNA. Even among the few scientists who had, nearly all dismissed it as unimportant. Sixty years on, DNA is one of the few aspects of science that can genuinely be called a &quot;household name&quot;. Indeed deoxyribonucleic acid really is &quot;in the DNA&quot; of our 21st-century culture. Just after Watson and Crick proposed their model in 1953, my father wrote to them, saying: &quot;I think it&apos;s a very exciting notion and who the hell got it isn&apos;t what matters  there is no good grousing.&quot; I don&apos;t think anyone connected with that letter would have believed quite how much &quot;grousing&quot; about &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot; the next 60 years would bring! DNA, in the most fundamental way, belongs to all of us, yet none of us. Our bodies are just vehicles for these primordial molecules, formed in slime pits millions of years ago, to reach the future by combining with others. Perhaps it&apos;s time to start thinking of the DNA effort in a similar way  the twin strands of Cambridge&apos;s conceptual model combining with King&apos;s experimental rigour to bring a new idea to life. Indeed, a fully accurate and verified structure for DNA required vital contributions from both sides. The four very different figures in the so-called &quot;race for DNA&quot; shared a common concern about the effect of science, including their science, on mankind. None could have hoped or expected that their work would have the impact it already has. Let&apos;s hope the end result of this &quot;very exciting notion&quot;, 60 years young, is that we&apos;ll all be the winners.George WilkinsLondon",

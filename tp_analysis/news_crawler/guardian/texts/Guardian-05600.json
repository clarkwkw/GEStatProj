    "text": "On New Year&apos;s Day 1999, as the first internet bubble was inflating at an accelerating rate, I published in my newspaper column a supposedly leaked memo from an internet startup I&apos;d invented to lampoon the craze. The bogus startup was called eTattler.com, which I envisioned as an auction service, run by utterly unethical people, for salacious information about politicians, celebrities and other public figures.The memo was over the top, I thought, in its satire of the increasingly bizarre Silicon Valley of that era  a place where hopelessly nutty and cynical startups got funded, promoted and then offloaded, with massive profits for insiders, to suckers in public markets. Apparently my absurdity quotient wasn&apos;t sufficiently excessive, because after the column was published I got several calls and emails from people who said, essentially: &quot;If this isn&apos;t a joke, I want to invest&quot; or: &quot;If this isn&apos;t a joke, I want to advertise.&quot;My editors and I thereby decided to keep eTattler alive, and I produced a series of leaked memos during the next few months. We ended the saga by having the entire eTattler staff arrested for fraud. Well, almost the entire crew: the CEO  enriched by the IPO proceeds from his less-than-worthless enterprise, slipped through the net, and his whereabouts remain unknown, though it is rumored that he became a senior executive at a Wall Street investment bank during the property and financial bubbles of the next decade.I bring all this up for two reasons. First, I&apos;m debating whether to resurrect eTattler or something like it. The times seem unfortunately appropriate. And eTattler&apos;s former CEO remains at liberty, which stands to reason given the way the Bush and Obama administrations ignored, and even rewarded, financial wrongdoing by the 1%.The second reason I recall eTattler so fondly today is the upcoming Facebook IPO. I have no idea whether the offering price will be appropriate, because I can&apos;t yet decide what I believe about Facebook&apos;s longer-term prospects. But I&apos;m quite sure of this: we are in a tech bubble again, even if it differs in significant ways from the last one.The excitement surrounding Facebook&apos;s offering plainly extends to Main Street. We&apos;re seeing news stories chronicling the wishes of average Americans to get a piece of the action. This tells me that whatever the price Facebook sets for sale to its initial public-offering buyers, the street price of the shares will likely soar the first day.Since you probably can&apos;t get Facebook stock at the IPO insider price (much less the price earlier investors paid), I have a deal for anyone who feels left out: shares in eTattler. This &quot;stock&quot; is, as it always was, entirely free of charge, apart from what it&apos;ll cost you to print out a certificate. (Actually, feel free to print as many as you want. Why settle for 10,000 shares when you can have a million?) One of the benefits of owning eTattler shares is that you can&apos;t lose money on them, since there&apos;s no charge. True, barring fraud or other nasty behavior of your part, you can&apos;t make any money on it, either. But I&apos;d call this a safe investment if ever there was one. And in this market, if you wanted an Internet stock to call your own with total assurance of not having to gamble your children&apos;s college money, this may be one of the best.I even have a stock certificate for you. It was created by the excellent graphics department at my former newspaper, the San Jose Mercury News in Silicon Valley, and you can download it here.Perhaps my favorite moment during the eTattler saga was the emergence of a competitor of sorts, the brainchild of several Silicon Valley majordomos who wanted to capitalize on the market that eTattler had identified. They created HeyIdiot.com  an enterprise with a business model even more brazen than eTattler&apos;s. It was, simply: &quot;Send us money.&quot;Ah, the good old days ",

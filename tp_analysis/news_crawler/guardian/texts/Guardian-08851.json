    "text": "Perhaps this is a reaction born in part in America&apos;s irresponsible inaction on climate change, but I have come to the view that what&apos;s needed now is a massive, in-the-streets citizens protest  a global Tahrir Square. I fear that governments will procrastinate unless unprecedented numbers of people across the world continue to put it all on the line with non-violent demonstrations, marches, and protests and move with determination from protest to movement to power before it is too late. In the realms of science and policy, we have known enough for decades, but normal NGO advocacy has been incapable of forcing political systems, especially in the United States, to act on what we know.

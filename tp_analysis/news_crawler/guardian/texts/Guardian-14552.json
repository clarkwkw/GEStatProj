    "headline": "20 best Android apps this week", 
    "text": "It&apos;s time for our weekly roundup of brand new and notable apps for Android smartphones and tablets. It covers apps and games, with the prices referring to the initial download: so (Free) may mean (Freemium) in some cases. The equivalent iOS roundup will be published later in the day. For now, read on for this week&apos;s Android selection. CSR Racing (Free) Freemium drag-racing game CSR Racing was one of the biggest iOS hits of 2012, but now it&apos;s roared onto Android. The game sees you buying, upgrading and racing a range of cars from Audi, BMW and other manufacturers, with an emphasis on customisation and in-app purchases used to fund the action. Facebook Home (Free) Released on Google Play just after last week&apos;s Android roundup, Facebook Home is the social network&apos;s launcher for taking over Android smartphone homescreens, putting friends&apos; updates and photos front and centre. For now, it&apos;s officially only available for devices like the Galaxy S III, Galaxy Note II, HTC One X and HTC One X+, with more to follow. Cut the Rope: Time Travel (0.62) Cutesy monster Om Nom has returned with a third Cut the Rope game for Android, with a time-travelling theme as he tries to feed sweets to his ancestors. The action is very similar to the previous games: you&apos;re cutting ropes to solve physics-puzzles across six locations, although this time there are two on-screen monsters to feed, not one. GuardianWitness (Free) Obvious disclosure: this is an app from the Apps Blog&apos;s parent company Guardian News &amp; Media. Described as &quot;the home of user-generated content on the Guardian&quot;, the app helps readers contribute to live news stories, suggest other stories and features, and enter competitions. Submissions can include text, photos and/or videos. MyGlass (Free) MyGlass has a small niche audience for now: early recipients of the first Google Glass eyewear prototypes. The app enables them to configure and manage the device from their Android phones. More than 1,000 people have already downloaded the app, as the first devices are sent out. Dungeon Hunter 4 (Free) Gameloft&apos;s dungeon-crawling adventure is back for its fourth iteration, and like the third instalment, this is freemium. Buying gems in-app beefs up your prospects as you wander through sprawling environments laying waste to enemies. Libon (Free) Libon is the work of Orange, promising &quot;visual voicemail that does it all&quot;. That means free Voice-over-IP calls and instant messaging, with a voicemail feature to handle calls when you&apos;re not available to answer, with email notifications and text messages. Yahoo! Mail (Free) The Yahoo! Mail app isn&apos;t new for Android smartphones, but the company has released a new version that&apos;s optimised for tablets. It works with the Yahoo! Mail service, with support for multiple accounts, photo attachments and notifications for new messages. Tripomatic City Guides &amp; Maps (Free) Tripomatic is one of the startups trying to build a business out of personalised travel guide apps. This is its first Android release, providing guides to more than 40k attractions in 300 holiday spots around the world. The idea: you can plan an itinerary using the app or the Tripomatic website then access it on the go, and also add your own places if desired. Stick Cricket Premier League (Free) As the Indian Premier League cricket league gets underway in its sixth season, there&apos;s a marvellous spin-off game from Stick Sports that lets you build and manage a squad as well as slogging it out on the pitch. It&apos;s based on the existing Stick Cricket game, with similarly addictive gameplay. iBomber (Free) Arcade bombing game (as in bomber pilots and planes, obviously) iBomber was great fun on iOS when it came out in 2009. Now it&apos;s finally available on Android. The game sees you flying missions over the Pacific Ocean in 1943, with 26 to complete, and social features to compare your skills with friends. OrSaveIt (Free) OrSaveIt is described as an &quot;impulse savings app&quot; something designed to help you save money for specific goals or treats. &quot;Choose a picture of your saving goal, set your target amount and then use the impulse save icons to make saves, on the go,&quot; explains its Google Play listing. Paper Toss 2.0 (Free) It&apos;s a mark of the Paper Toss series&apos; popularity that a few days after launch, this sequel is already past the 500k downloads mark on Android. The core gameplay is the same as its predecessor: chucking paper balls into an office wastepaper basket with flicks of your finger. This time round, bananas, grenades and co-workers are flung into the mix. PODFY - Podcast Player (1.96) PODFY styles itself as a &quot;cloud podcast player&quot; which runs across smartphones, tablets and PC. It keeps tracks of the podcasts you&apos;ve downloaded, and enables you to sort them into playlists with automation to lighten the load of compiling them. Crunchd (Free) Crunchd is an app for people who grow, cook and eat their own food, aiming to connect them with one another in local communities. The idea is that they swap advice, keep diaries of what they&apos;re growing and eating, upload photos and trade excess produce with one another. Visual Calendar for Tablets (3.91) Visual Calendar is certainly ambitious: an app that wants to &quot;change the way you plan your life&quot;. If you think that means a slick-looking calendar app with neat coloured icons, take a bow. &quot;Think Mind Map for your project turned into actual tasks and dates, or events and appointments from your organizer presented in an intuitive, task-oriented way,&quot; explains its Google Play listing. Well worth a look. I Am Vegend  Zombiegeddon (Free) Birds, pigs and zombies... together at last! Android game I Am Vegend has its tongue in its cheek across its 45 missions, for a game that&apos;s less a parody and more a &quot;mind-blowing travesty of mobile game hits&quot;. It looks good fun though. First Wood War (Free) First Wood War looks like a game with plenty to chew on for more serious gamers: a real-time strategy game with a player-versus-player online mode, impressive graphics and more than 20 battle maps to explore in its solo mode. It&apos;s all set in the woods, which brings us neatly on to... Forest HD (0.99) This sits somewhere between an app and a live wallpaper: an atmospheric virtual forest to explore, peering at birds, deer and plants, with add-on packs offering butterflies, babbling brooks and customisation. Measure Book (1.95) Finally, Measure Book, a productivity app for people making home improvements. It lets you take photos of rooms, then insert lines and measurements to check fittings, sharing the results by email, Facebook or via cloud services Evernote and Dropbox. That&apos;s this week&apos;s selection, but what do you think? Make your own recommendations, or give your views on the apps above, by posting a comment.",

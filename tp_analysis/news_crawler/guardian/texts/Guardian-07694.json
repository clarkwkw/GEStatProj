    "text": "Rockstar would appear to be accelerating its pre-publicity drive for long awaited gangster sequel, Grand Theft Auto V. On Monday, the publisher released three new shots from the game on its own news site, showing different types of transport players will use in the adventure. Fans of previous instalments were excited to see that both the bicycle and jet fighter are returning. But that was only the beginning of a subtle and teasing campaign. On Wednesday, in a post headlined Leisure, the Rockstar site has unveiled three new screens.     Grand Theft Auto V    One shows characters dirt biking through a desert environment; another has a game of tennis in the grounds of a lavish mansion, and the best has one protagonist base jumping into a picturesque valley.      Grand Theft Auto V    The suggestion is that players will be able to indulge in various sports and pastimes in between bouts of anarchic gunplay. The debut trailer for the title, released last November, also included scenes of characters zooming around on jet skis and playing golf. This time the action is set in Los Santos, the GTA version of Los Angeles, and seems to take place amid movie industry movers and shakers, particularly based in the Vinewood sector  a clear reference to Hollywood, of course.     Grand Theft Auto V    Rockstar is yet to confirm a release date for the title, though many are expecting an announcement soon, for a 2013 launch. There are rumours however, that the game may be a launch title for the next generation of Sony and Microsoft consoles.      Grand Theft Auto V    For now, the games press is left to reflect and ruminate on the meaning of dirt biking and bike riding on the sun-baked streets of San Andreas.",

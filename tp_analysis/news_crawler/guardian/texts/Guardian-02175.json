    "headline": "Is it worth buying British bikes?", 
    "text": "If you owned a bike before the 1980s in this country, the chances are it was British-made. If you own one today, it most likely isn&apos;t. We were once the brains and brawn of bicycle design on a global scale: the inventors, the innovators, and the custodians of the cycle workshop of the world. I have no memory of those heady days, unless you count a hazy ride on the back of the squishy leather seat on my cousin&apos;s Raleigh Chopper in the mid-1980s. My first non-stabiliser bike was an imported BMX. But the thought of what once was depresses me. It seems like a waste of knowledge, especially given the boom in cycle sales in recent years. With soaring fuel costs reducing the margin on imports, unemployment at a 15-year high and a growing suggestion that people would pay more for British-made brands, it&apos;s a crying shame that there isn&apos;t a proper bike manufacturing industry in this country. Of course in Brompton and Pashley, both UK-owned with factories in west London and Stratford-upon-Avon respectively, there is genuine reason for cheer. Brompton is now the largest volume bicycle manufacturer in this country, with Pashley, who made the last all UK-sourced bike in 1986, before Michelin closed their tyre factory in Stoke-on-Trent, not far behind. But what if you don&apos;t want a folding bike or an upright? Well there&apos;s also cheer from a growing band of young British frame-builders, who have sprung up in the past five years, with Britishness being a massive part of their sell. Ted James, who makes his own frames at his workshop off Brick Lane in London, using Reynolds steel tubing from its Birmingham factory, says: &quot;It&apos;s about the history of the British bike industry, which creates a story and a great feeling of quality and worth. Reynolds is one of the world&apos;s leading bicycle tube suppliers and held the first patent for butted tubing technology over 100 years ago. Along with buying a high-quality product made with care, they [his customers] are buying into a piece of history.&quot; Shand Cycles in Livingston, Scotland originally produced steel frames &quot;made to order, one at a time&quot; but recently they decided to add some all-road stock frames to their offering for &quot;touring, commuting or even the odd thrash at your local cyclocross race&quot;. They had planned to get these made in Asia, but following a survey on their website, changed their minds. Russell Stout, one half of Shand, says: &quot;I was quite taken aback at the time people had taken to provide their thoughts. We had over 200 responses and through the comments realised there&apos;s a lot of passion for frames made in the UK. It also fitted with our own philosophy of wanting to bring bike manufacturing back to Scotland and we would rather invest in setting up a workshop here than buying in frames from overseas. &quot;It also means we&apos;ve got much better control over quality  and because everything is made to order we can add value by providing an element of customisation with regards to finish (such as cable routing and paint and graphics).&quot; Both Ted James Design and Shand Cycles will be exhibiting at Bespoked, the UK handmade bicycle show in Bristol later this month. Now in its second year, organiser Phil Taylor tells me old school frame-builders such as Lee Cooper have been joined by several start-ups over the past five years. He says: &quot;In part, the growth has been influenced by the US and the popularity of track bike designs and the fixed-gear movement, plus there&apos;s a desire among people to use their hands and build things, as an alternative way of making a career. But it&apos;s a real labour of love with not much profit. It&apos;s difficult if you have a mortgage and a family to support.&quot; Aside from supporting British industry and buying a bike (well, a frame at least) with a reduced carbon footprint that hasn&apos;t been shipped across the globe, what does the consumer get? Phil Taylor says: &quot;It&apos;s made to suit your individual style. It will fit you better size-wise so mechanically it will ride better, and perhaps best of all this bike wouldn&apos;t exist if you hadn&apos;t commissioned it.&quot; Three years ago, having had my second off-the-peg bike stolen, a friend suggested I put the insurance money towards a bespoke build from 14 Bike Co. It was twice the price of my last bike, even factoring in the then larger Cyclescheme tax relief, but it&apos;s a super smooth ride, that has without doubt improved my already enjoyable daily 14-mile round commute beyond measure. I love the fact that the frame is Lee Cooper, it&apos;s probably one of the only truly British things I own, though its value does mean it has to sleep in my front room at night. So yes these artisan products come at a cost, and you&apos;d never advocate a new or occasional cyclist (that wasn&apos;t an oligarch) buying one, but as Rob Penn noted in It&apos;s All About the Bike: &quot;You can have a custom-built frame, designed to fit your body and tuned for the type of riding you do, for a lot less money than many exotic, mass-manufactured stock frames sold in shops.&quot; Not everyone agrees with the point of buying a British frame, however. Chris Juden, senior technical officer at the CTC, says: &quot;There&apos;s so much else to a bike (that NOBODY makes in Britain anymore) besides the frame that it doesn&apos;t make a whole lot of difference if only that part was made here. Except then the bike will have also been assembled here, but then that&apos;s also the case with bespoke bikes built on imported frames.&quot; But what do you think? Is there any point in buying British if you can&apos;t have an entirely UK-made bike? Or does every little help?  Sam Haddad is the editor of Cooler, a sport and style magazine for young women",

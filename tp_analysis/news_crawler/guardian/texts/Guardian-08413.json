    "text": "Within minutes of the launch of the iOS6 operating system, which comes preloaded with Apple Maps, users were reporting problems. What had happened to Paddington station? Had Sears Tower in Chicago shrunk overnight? Users have been busily posting examples on Twitter and other social media. Share the glitches and problems that you&apos;ve spotted in the comments section below, or tweet @guardian with your examples. We&apos;ll update this article with the best that we receive. Here are a couple of unfortunate cases posted on Twitter. First up, a zoo in the middle of tourist Dublin?  @guardian Dublin zoo in the middle of temple bar :facepalm: #apocolapps twitpic.com/awkwrf Conor O&apos;Byrne (@conorobyrne) September 20, 2012  Some sudden new infrastructure reported in south London:  @guardian the three new petrol stations which appeared over night! twitter.com/AJH_Worksuppor AJ Harland (@AJH_Worksupport) September 20, 2012  A town in Wales goes walkabout:  @guardian the town of Pontypridd has been moved 6 miles NW, and dumped on top of where Tonypandy should be #iOS6maps twitter.com/AlunRhydian/st  Aln Davies (@AlunRhydian) September 20, 2012  And a spot of trouble in Wivenhoe:  What happened last night? Wivenhoe is now in the river and Rowhedge has crossed over the river. #whoknew #iosmaps twitter.com/trevorappleton  Trevor Appleton (@trevorappleton) September 20, 2012   @guardian quite a few restaurants, bars and cafs in my area that simply don&apos;t exist anymore still on the map #iosmaps Michael Chapman (@raczilla33) September 20, 2012   @guardian Um, garages that closed 5 yrs ago, absence of new roads, incorrect positioning of POI, no rural placenames. More? #iosmaps  FirstOptionSolutions (@FOSolutions) September 20, 2012  Spielo:  Just worked out why it can&apos;t find Paddington Station: It&apos;s because the station is called &quot;London Paddington&quot;, not &quot;Paddington&quot;. If you search for the actual station name, it finds it. Definitely not good enough, but it&apos;s useful to know a little about what the app is doing at least...  cutta:  London seems to consist of neighbourhoods from Victorian times. Candlewick and Walbrook in the City for instance. Plenty of other weird and wrong labels too.  And another example of Apple Maps inspired existential ennui:  @guardian It&apos;s decided the small town I live in is actually on a tiny deserted island 10 km west of here #iOS6maps  Tsana Dolichva (@Tsana_D) September 20, 2012  We&apos;ll be updating this blogpost as we receive further examples.",

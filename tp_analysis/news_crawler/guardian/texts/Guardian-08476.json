    "text": "A new European weather satellite was blasted into orbit from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on a Soyuz rocket on Monday. Metop-B is set to play a vital part in scientists&apos; plans to monitor weather patterns and climate change. It will sweep over the poles, orbiting the Earth once every 100 minutes at a height of 500 miles. Its instruments will make detailed measurements of sea-surface temperatures, wind patterns, trace gases in the atmosphere, humidity and other variables. Alain Ratier, director general of the Eumetsat agency, which built the satellite, said: &quot;Our ability to make accurate weather forecasts is vital to Europe. More than a third of our industry is weather dependent. That is why Metop-B is important, for it is estimated that almost 5bn a year is saved to European industry thanks to the information that is provided by weather satellites.&quot; After a nervous wait of more than two hours, controllers announced that the craft&apos;s solar panels  which will provide the power for Metop-B&apos;s five-year mission  had successfully deployed. &quot;This is the first part of a real success for European meteorology,&quot; said Ernst Koenemann, director of programmes for Eumetsat.",

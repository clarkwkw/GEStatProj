(@globalvybe) January 27, 2012   Dear @Twitter, I&apos;ve decided to join #TwitterBlackout Protest of new #TwitterCensored policy. I will NOT tweet on Sat, Jan 28.  luis prieto (@luisprieto) January 27, 2012   Why boycott it just for 1 day If you really think it&apos;s wrong, talk about a week or a month &amp; I shall take you seriously #TwitterCensorship  Hani Arif (@haniarif) January 27, 2012   Twitter&apos;s new policy on tweet censorship will make it increasingly difficult to not be seen as a tool of US-foreign policy during unrest.  Chanders (@Chanders) January 27, 2012   Surprised there&apos;s not more outrage about #twittercensorship - although maybe there is and the tweets are being blocked.  Rory Wilson (@alnya) January 27, 2012   Twitter, why don&apos;t you ban porn spammers instead of free thinkers? #TwitterCensorship  Noemi Shams (@NoemiShams) January 27, 2012   #TwitterCensorship. Dear Twitter, I face so much censorship in Sudan as a journalist, you were my free and safe space. I&apos;m grieving now.     (@ReemShawkat) January 27, 2012   #twittercensorship At least they have stated that a removed tweet will be prominently displayed as removed (as opposed to simply vanishing).  Matt Giuca (@mgiuca) January 27, 2012   I wonder how much energy will be expended today debating #TwitterCensored that would otherwise be spent discussing #Syria.

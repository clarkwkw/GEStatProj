Samsung Digimax V70/a7     Question: This Sichuan province mystery bird may remind you of several other species, especially a widespread European species. What species might that be? How would you distinguish the two? Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult green-backed tit, Parus monticolus, a small songbird that is placed into Paridae; the tits, chickadees, and titmice. This bird&apos;s sister species is the common and widely-ranging great tit, P. major, which closely resembles the green-backed tit. The green-backed tit is found in a variety of deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests ranging from boreal and temperate forests, to subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. They are a residential cavity-nesting species, and forage on a wide variety of foods, including fruits, insects and their larvae, and seeds, although they focus mainly on eating invertebrates during summer, and seeds during winter. They also eat fat from animal carcasses. This species looks very similar to the great tit but can be distinguished by its two white wing bars, the white patch at the base of its wing covers, brighter green upperparts and blue leading edges on its wing feathers. Based on what we can see in this image, it&apos;s really difficult to separate the two species, so the best we can do is narrow down the identity of this bird to either a great tit or a green-backed tit. Here&apos;s a video of a green-backed tit foraging and singing in India. In this video, you can clearly see its two wingbars:            [video link] .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

    "text": "I set my alarm for 6 am on Monday 6 August 2012 so I would wake in time to follow the live feed of the landing of Nasa&apos;s Curiosity rover on Mars. As a scientist who is also a bit of a geek, this is the sort of thing I like to do. Back in June I got up even earlier to catch a glimpse of the last transit of Venus that will occur in my lifetime. I won&apos;t go into the details of the Curiosity landing  an immense technical achievement  since it has already been widely reported. But as I watched the rows of tense, blue-shirted staff at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory suddenly leap and whoop and hug when news of the successful touchdown reached them, and their excitement rippled across the web into my dimly lit bedroom, I noticed the date at the top of my computer screen. And I realised that the landing had occurred on the anniversary of Hiroshima atomic bomb. I took to Twitter to note the coincidence:    67 years ago today, the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. #curiosity landing a far, far better use of human technology.&mdash; Stephen Curry (@Stephen_Curry) August 6, 2012   The tweet went viral  at least by my standards. By the end of the day, it had been re-tweeted across the world over 1,600 times. I also picked up about 100 new followers, though they&apos;ll soon drift away once they realise my tweets are rarely so pithy. Most people simply repeated my message; like me they didn&apos;t pause to think the matter through very deeply. In our defence the medium is better suited to reflex than reflection, but there were a few thoughtful souls who raised interesting questions that began to fill in the grey shades absent from my black-and-white tweet. One noted that Curiosity will rely on long-life nuclear batteries to propel itself across the surface of Mars, highlighting an upside of the discovery of nuclear fission. Others defended the bombing itself, arguing that it had ultimately saved countless lives by hastening the end of the second world war, a point of view that is debated even today. As ever in science, things get complicated very quickly and a tweet can only be a starting point for a proper discussion.      The dual use of science was also raised on a recent episode of The Infinite Monkey Cage, a BBC Radio 4 show in which Robin Ince and the telegenic Prof Brian Cox like to stir the pot of science and have fun with its oddly shaped vegetables. At 30 minutes an episode, Ince, Cox and guests have more room than a tweet for their subject matter, but the format can still feel constrained at times. On this occasion they gave themselves half an hour to sort out CP Snow&apos;s lamented divide between science and the humanities, set up  in the best Radio 4 tradition  as the battle of science versus art. The show was mostly good-natured banter but did touch on some serious issues. It fell to panellist Sarah Pascoe to wonder about the ability of science to expand humanity&apos;s scope for evil. However, the discussion got side-tracked by gags about Hitler&apos;s bad art so the question wasn&apos;t properly addressed. There was further deviation when the conversation alighted on the topic of the utility of science. As Al Murray stumbled briefly over an opener about Newton figuring out gravity and the laws of mechanics, Cox, evidently also master of pith, stepped in with the crack, &quot;  and civilisation follows&quot;. Now, of course there&apos;s a bit more to it than that, and Cox surely understands the intimate interdependence of science, art, religion and geopolitics that has brought us to our current state of development, but I found myself despairing slightly about the forced shallowness of the discussion. Only slightly, mind  let&apos;s keep a sense of perspective; this is a comedy show and a smart one to boot. But are we always going to be beating up the wrong guy, endlessly dissecting the artificial divide between science and the humanities? I hope not. I don&apos;t see the divide myself (and nor, to be fair, did the Infinite Monkey Cage panel when they dropped their comedy guard). We need art to articulate our response to the world and the mysteries of existence, especially as they are revealed to us in ever greater complexity by science. Could Joyce&apos;s Ulysses or Camus&apos;s L&apos;tranger have been written before evolutionary theory and cosmology radically revised humankind&apos;s understanding of its place in the universe?  Art is perhaps particularly necessary when science produces new potential for horror. On witnessing the terrifying power of the first test of the atomic bomb he had laboured so hard to create, Robert Oppenheimer could only think of words from the Bhagavad Gita, a classic of Hindu scripture: &quot;We are become death, the destroyer of worlds.&quot; I didn&apos;t mean for this to get quite so heavy but the point is this: science and the humanities should be on speaking terms and will hopefully always be curious about one another. This spurt of new growth among the science blogs here at the Guardian should enlarge that conversation. I&apos;m a great believer in the power of dialogue to nix misconceptions: the most wonderful moment in that last Infinite Monkey Cage show was hearing Al Murray&apos;s delighted surprise on learning that our fellow Guardian science blogger, Prof Jon Butterworth, would have been just as interested in the outcome if the LHC had not found the Higgs boson. Through that exchange he saw something new about the unpredictable nature of science and scientists. As that example shows, a good way to make science more approachable to those who may feel daunted by its experiments and hypotheses is to humanise the people involved. That mission was established  and still continues  at Occam&apos;s Typewriter, an independent blogging network powered by a motley crew of scientists and former scientists. We are grateful to the good folks at the Guardian who have given us the opportunity to further that mission. Here at Occam&apos;s Corner, the regulars of Occam&apos;s Typewriter will take it in turns to write about their own experiences of the business, hopefully engaging entirely new audiences. However, even here the posts are constrained by space and time, so not every &apos;i&apos; will be dotted, not every &apos;t&apos; crossed, but the beauty of the format is that we can continue conversation in the comments and, together, close any gaps in understanding. We hope you&apos;ll join in. It&apos;ll be a lot easier than landing a nuclear-powered rover on Mars.",

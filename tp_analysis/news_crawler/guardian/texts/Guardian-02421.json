    "text": "Talk to parents whose children are using apps, and you&apos;ll often find a nagging concern in the back of their minds about digital play cannibalising physical play. If a toddler has access to beautiful, interactive touchscreen apps, will he or she still be interested in building blocks, plasticine, painting and toy cars? Call it a re-run of the kids/TV debate, if you like. In my experience, the concerns have been unfounded, because there isn&apos;t an either/or dynamic here. My children are as happy digging around in Lego and painting smiley faces as they are playing on an iPad. But there&apos;s another interesting trend emerging: apps that try to reach out into the real world to merge digital and physical play. You can see it in Toca Boca&apos;s Toca Tea Party and Toca Store apps, which are designed to be used as a spark for real-world roleplaying rather than a replacement for it. Meanwhile Disney and Crayola have launched accessories for kid-apps  a toy car and a crayon-like peripheral respectively. Hallmark sells teddy bears that interact with a series of book-apps when placed next to the iPad. This is just the start. Makego is another great example of the boundaries blurring between digital and physical play. The app was released in February 2012 by British artist and designer Chris O&apos;Shea, who has worked on a number of installation artworks in recent years. The Makego app runs on an iPhone or iPod touch, and takes the form of a series of cartoon vehicles, seen from a top-down perspective  a racing car, ice cream truck and a river boat. That means engine noises and speedometers, ice creams and a till, and leaks and bread for ducks respectively. The twist is this: children make a physical chassis to house the iOS device cardboard and Lego are the two obvious methods and can then drive their virtual car around on the floor or tabletop. It&apos;s a very clever yet simple idea. &quot;I got really interested in why play is important, looking at how parents and kids play together and get surprised by things,&quot; says O&apos;Shea. &quot;I also wanted to do something that more people could experience. Installations attract quite a limited audience, and only exist in videos afterwards. I liked the idea of having something that people could buy and play with at home.&quot; Having considered doing something with the Xbox Kinect controller, O&apos;Shea ultimately decided to try an iPhone app. Hence Makego, which he says is most definitely a toy rather than an educational product. And one that&apos;s designed to be shared. &quot;I think we&apos;ll start to see more co-play experiences between parent and child on these devices,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s not just about giving the child a phone in the back of the car to keep them quiet. It&apos;s about using things around the kitchen table.&quot; O&apos;Shea admits that one barrier to using Makego is that requirement for physical creation, which may not suit all parents. &quot;The barrier for some parents may be &apos;How do I make this car?&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to be the sort of parent who would sit down and make that thing with your child. A lot of people might rather buy the car though, so I&apos;ve been thinking about making card templates.&quot; He is also trying to encourage an online community around Makego, with parents sharing photos and videos of their creations to inspire others. These are already starting to filter through. O&apos;Shea isn&apos;t dogmatic on the physical v digital play topic, but he does have strong views that physical play is important. &quot;Kids need to have some time with cardboard, paint and Lego,&quot; he says. &quot;It can&apos;t just be about an iPad and an Xbox.&quot;            Makego has had a steady start on the App Store, with a decent chunk of early downloaders using it for half an hour or more at a time. The app is currently housed in the Education category, but O&apos;Shea would like to see Apple tweak the way it retails apps for children. &quot;I think they need a dedicated Kids category, and hopefully Apple will add one,&quot; says O&apos;Shea. &quot;You want a rolling curated selection of what&apos;s new this week that isn&apos;t just tied to educational content.&quot; For now, he&apos;s starting to think about future updates for Makego, with additional vehicles the most obvious option. Revamping the graphics and adding more sounds may also be on the cards, but O&apos;Shea also has other ideas. &quot;There are various other digital toy apps I&apos;d like to try, which range from having physical things that you build out of cardboard around an iPad to use it as a stage or window, through to apps where you&apos;re being creative on the iPad itself.&quot;",

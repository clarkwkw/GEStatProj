    "text": "The colourful exhibits of children&apos;s work that once graced the reception area of the Department for Education have long gone. Instead, serried portraits of former secretaries of state now gaze down on visitors to Sanctuary Buildings. No doubt meant to convey a sense of history and purpose, they are also a reminder that &quot;education&quot; has too often been a staging post for ministers on their way to &quot;higher things&quot;. But not this time. Following the first major reshuffle of the coalition government, Michael Gove is still secretary of state and the coalition&apos;s enthusiasm for educational reform will be unabated. But a passion for reform needs to be matched by delivery that is realistic and ensures key players are on board. MPs of all parties report postbags of irate letters from headteachers and parents complaining about the grading of this summer&apos;s GCSEs. Yet Gove has already set other examination hares running, with the potential to affect thousands of students in the future. In May, leaked correspondence to Ofqual, the exam regulator, revealed that the secretary of state wanted A-levels reformed post-haste. Gove&apos;s aim was explicit: to involve universities in A-level development, but also to ensure that A-levels meet the needs of a small sub-set of higher education institutions that he regards as &quot;elite&quot;. Forty years ago, the primary purpose of A-levels was to ensure the progression of a very small percentage of students to a limited number of universities. For some time, this has not been the only raison d&apos;tre for A-levels. This point was grasped by the education select committee. In their report on examinations for 16- to 19-year-olds in England,MPs were adamant that schools, colleges, all universities and employers had an interest in A-level reform. They queried the timetable  Gove wants a number of A-levels to be ready for teaching by 2014  and concluded that his proposals risked creating a two-tier A-level system. These concerns were reflected in a roundtable hosted recently in the House of Commons by million+. Attended by MPs, the CBI, representatives from schools, exam boards and universities, there was a common consensus: A-levels need to help students to progress to all universities, enter employment and study for apprenticeships. And of course they are not just for young people. One in three undergraduates now progresses to university later in life. Many of these students study A-levels and other qualifications in their twenties and thirties. Working on a timetable not of its own making, Ofqual issued a consultation in June. This reveals the practical problems of trying to square the circle of examination reform without a national framework. Gove no longer wants the DfE to be responsible for a national qualification, but the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency, which might have provided a focus, was an early victim of the department&apos;s quango cull. Ofqual has proposed that each exam board should provide evidence that each A-level subject has been &quot;signed off&quot; by 20 UK universities of the board&apos;s choice for every subject. At least 10 must be &quot;leading research institutions&quot;. The notion that universities have more subject and teaching expertise because historically they have received more research funding is nonsensical. University &quot;sign-off&quot; as a symbol of higher education involvement in A-level reform is widely regarded as unworkable. It also risks A-levels being infected with a league-table hierarchy unrelated to the quality of teaching and learning. Organisations that represent the science community reject the idea that science subjects should be first in line for A-level reform. Roundtable participants were unanimous in their opposition to the phased introduction of new A-levels and a hasty timetable that could harm students. There was anxiety about how new A-levels would fit with the as-yet unpublished proposals for GCSEs and concern that the DfE focus was on &quot;rigour&quot; when exams should be about participation as well as challenge. The structure and assessment of A-levels can be improved, although the idea that students should lose all opportunities to resit has been rightly challenged by the National Union of Students. The outcome of Ofqual&apos;s consultation, which ends on Tuesday, will land on ministerial desks in early October. Ministers should remember those summer postbags and find a unifying way forward rather than take a walk down memory lane.  Pam Tatlow is chief executive of the university thinktank million+.

    "text": "Codemasters&apos; precision-engineered Formula One sim reaches its third incarnation with this year&apos;s outing and, building on the previous two, it is making a credible case to be the finest F1 series on any generation of console. Handling has always been key to the realism of this sim, and while some of the oversensitivity of the previous games has been stabilised, the cars have been modelled without exhaust-blown diffusers (now banned in F1) and therefore don&apos;t grip quite as well. So with driver aids switched off, these are trickier beasts to handle, but also more predictable, which places more emphasis, entirely realistically, on mechanical grip and tyre wear. It rewards intelligent driving and is Codemasters&apos; best physics engine yet. There are flaws  the lack of Friday practice sessions and scaled tyre degradation in shorter races will irk the purists  but equally there&apos;s a nice tutorial for new gamers in the form of the Young Drivers&apos; Test, a truncated Season Challenge for more concentrated thrills, and a Champions mode pitting gamers against the six current world champions, which will doubtless appeal more to anyone looking for a run-out less demanding than a full career-long drive. There&apos;s fine-tuning ahead for Codemasters (notably in the shape of the still occasionally witless AI), but F1 2012 has a front-row slot nailed.",

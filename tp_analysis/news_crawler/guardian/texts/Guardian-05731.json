    "text": "What youll learnEngineering degrees cover all things related to developing, providing and maintaining infrastructure, products and services that society needs  from researching how to manufacture a product to building bridges and roads. Students will find themselves studying all, or part, of the life cycle of a product, from conception and design to creation. Science and maths will be the core ingredients, but you will be required to be innovative and know how to use your creative flair within a legal and ethical framework, and in budget. If you choose materials engineering, you will be entering the most specialist discipline in the engineering stable, which means there are fewer university courses to choose from. It does, however, cover a wide study area, as you will be looking at how everything is made and how it could all be improved. Materials engineering is the meeting point of science and engineering. Youll be required to develop the materials needed for new products, as well as find better, cheaper, quicker, stronger ways of producing those already out there. If you choose minerals engineering, you will learn about geology, rock mechanics, engineering design, economics, surveying and management. You might focus on blast analysis, advanced-surface and underground surveying, health and safety, ventilation networks, rock mechanics or mineral processing.   interactive   How youll learnYoull learn through a combination of lectures, tutorials and workshops, as well as practical sessions in the lab or computer workshops. Most courses will encourage you to get hands-on experience by pursuing a project. Through this, youll learn the practical steps of taking your ideas from the drawing board to the real world. Youll learn how to solve problems and overcome obstacles, particularly when it comes to considering the social and ethical difficulties your work could create. Engineering will involve plenty of teamwork, so youll acquire the ability to argue your ideas, analyse those of others and work towards a common goal. Most courses have strong links with industry, so theres a chance that you might work on real-world problems or complete work placements as part of your course. What are the entry requirements?Entry requirements vary. Russell Group universities will require maths and physics. Further maths, design and technology and computing or computer science could also prove useful.   interactive   What job can I get?Careers in manufacturing, processing or in user industries are among the options for materials engineering graduates, perhaps working in research, production or even sales. If you want to research ways of making cars run cheaper and more environmentally friendly, then motor companies will definitely want to hear from you. And local and central government are keen to improve their recycling processes, if youre interested in this area. You could also find work in non-governmental organisations.",

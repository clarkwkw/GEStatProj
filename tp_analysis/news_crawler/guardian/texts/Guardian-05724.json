    "text": "When it appeared on PC last year VVVVVV quickly became an underground hit, despite, or perhaps because of, its simplistic graphics and lo-fi gameplay. Captain Viridian has crashed his spaceship and lost his five crewmates (whose names also happen to start with V, hence the title). In order to find them and escape this weird new environment he must explore his new surroundings, scurrying along the floor, or, having flipped gravity, along the ceiling. This simple (and single) game mechanic makes for some truly stupendous puzzles, mind-boggling twists and three or so hours of completely flawless gameplay. So, if you have a 3DS, buy it. You won&apos;t regret it, although you will have to wait to get the level editor that featured in the original.",

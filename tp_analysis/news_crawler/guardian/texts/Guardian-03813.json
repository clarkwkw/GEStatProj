    "text": "The unseen truth about school I&apos;m an 11-year old girl living in Scotland. I am in primary 7 of a small school. This is only my second year at school, because I was home-schooled before that. When I was home-schooled, nobody made an issue of me being a girl. Since I started school, I&apos;ve had to put up with being told girls can&apos;t play football (which stinks in a country where women can&apos;t be paid to play football) and I can only wear pink pyjamas on Pyjama Day. Boys made jokes about me before I could understand them. Boys ask us what our bra sizes are. If this happened at work, it would be harassment, but it has become normal. The AAUW&apos;s Crossing The Line report showed that more than half of girls aged 12-18 in US schools had experienced sexual harassment. This includes verbal (jokes, sexual comments) and physical (groping etc) as well as online harassment. Www.girleffect.org explains that the longer girls stay in education, the better their prospects are. In the developing world, this can mean the difference between life and death. Girls with more schooling marry later (when they are ready), have less children, and the children they do have are healthier. Research shows that educating girls improves societies. When women earn, they invest 90% of their income into their families. Why, then, are girls allowed to be pushed out of education by harassment, poverty, abusive child marriage or prejudice?",

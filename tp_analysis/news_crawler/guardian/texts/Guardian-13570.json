    "text": "So-called &quot;phishing&quot; emails  messages aimed at stealing personal or financial information by spoofing  are a common menace on the internet, though one that&apos;s usually easily dismissed: most are littered with typos, odd requests, or unconvincing sender email addresses. (The ones pretending to be from PayPal or Amazon, for example, never have your username from the site - because that&apos;s the one detail the phishers don&apos;t have. Watch out for it.) But those adopting this form of attack, which grew out of the now notorious 419 emails which promise their targets a share of millions if they&apos;ll just wire a few thousand as an &quot;advance fee&quot;, are getting increasingly sophisticated. Take this email which fell into my inbox over the weekend, apparently from the US&apos;s Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The &quot;From&quot; and &quot;Reply-to&quot; fields of the email had both been made to look as if they came from the appropriate irs.gov domain, and the body of the message was a correctly-spelled jumble of incomprehensible legalese  not far different from any genuine email from any tax authority the world over. But it&apos;s only in the PDF attachment (which was checked for viruses and other nasties before opening) that things get really interesting. The form is named and laid out almost exactly like a genuine IRS tax form  but with one particular section, Part II, normally headed &quot;Claim of Tax Treaty Benefits&quot; that would normally ask for banal questions about beneficial owners replaced with a series of far more detailed questions than the real tax authority would want to know (bank details, mother&apos;s &quot;median&quot; [sic] name, passport number, and more). The form also relied on being returned by fax, rather than email  doubtless a hassle for sender and recipient alike, but perhaps a good trick to engender some trust by adding a bureaucratic hurdle.  A reverse lookup on the number, +1-705-242-0430, on the fax initially suggests it&apos;s a landline in Orillia, Ontario - but when you look more closely you discover that the number is assigned to Iristel, a Canadian VOIP provider. No doubt the phishers have hired the phone number which directs to a fax somewhere else in the world. From the pricing, it costs about $12 per month - chickenfeed if they catch even a single person and clean out their bank account. There&apos;s no suggestion Iristel is involved in the scam. When the Guardian dialled the number, it did respond with a fax tone, though it may have been connecting to a virtual fax. Still more intriguing to me, though, was whether this was a targeted attempt to phish me, rather than a generic attack sent to thousands of people  a practice known as &quot;spear phishing&quot; (geddit?). This is always tricky to pick up, but the signs in favour are firstly that my Guardian colleagues were not troubled by a similar email, and the form&apos;s filename is specifically marked as &quot;UK&quot;. The second is that the email was demanding details for those who had been in the US, needed to collect income or expenses, and been an alien on a non-resident visa. That isn&apos;t a huge group for a wild goose chase, but is one which does happen to include me, as I spent four months in the US last year.  We&apos;ve shared the phishing PDF in a document below, alongside the real IRS form it mimics, as an example of the growing elaboration of such attacks. If you&apos;ve received similarly sophisticated attacks (or this one itself), please do let us know down in the comments  and if you&apos;ve got the message text, so much the better. Here&apos;s the real form:      Genuine IRS W8-BEN form by       And now here&apos;s the phishing version:      Phisher&#x27;s W8-BEN form by        (Obviously, if you received the latter version and faxed the form off, contact your bank and credit card provider urgently.)",

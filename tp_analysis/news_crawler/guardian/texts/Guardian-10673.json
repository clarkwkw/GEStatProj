    "text": "Vince Cable, the business secretary, has officially marked the launch of the new green investment bank (GIB) by announcing funding of a new waste-to-energy plant and an energy saving scheme. The small projects to build a new anaerobic digestion plant in Teeside and retrofit a panel-making factory in north Wales, involving investments by the GIB of 8m and 5m respectively, will soak up only a tiny fraction of the bank&apos;s total 3bn in funding. Speaking before he formally confirmed the GIB was &quot;open for business&quot; on Wednesday morning in Edinburgh, Cable said these projects were proof of its wider ambitions to develop a low-carbon, clean energy economy. He said the bank, claimed by the government to be the world&apos;s first, &quot;will place the green economy at the heart of our recovery and position the UK in the forefront of the drive to develop clean energy. &quot;Three billion pounds of government money will leverage private sector capital to fund projects in priority sectors from offshore wind to waste and non-domestic energy efficiency, helping to deliver our commitment to create jobs and growth right across the UK.&quot; In a deliberately political dig at Alex Salmond&apos;s Scottish government, which is promising to work closely with the new bank, Cable added: &quot;Having the headquarters in Edinburgh is a powerful vote of confidence in the union, and a testimony to our commitment to helping Scotland lead the green revolution.&quot; The GIB  which has been criticised by senior figures in the renewables industry for apparently refusing to invest in promising new wave and tidal energy designs, on the grounds they are too risky  is expected to attract billions of pounds of spending from private investors and banks. Its main areas for investment will be offshore wind, waste-to-energy and industrial energy efficiency. The other sectors will be developing biofuels for transport, biomass power, carbon capture and storage, marine energy and renewable heat projects  all of which are in their infancy. In a move which raised questions about whether it is also designed to undermine Salmond&apos;s case for Scottish independence by stressing the relative financial strength of the UK, the GIB will have a large office in London. The London office will develop close and lucrative links to banks and investors, while the administrative base in Edinburgh will contain officials working on offshore and northern projects. The bank started work in October, after receiving state aid permission from the European Commission. The GIB said the anaerobic digestion plant would be the first of six waste-to-energy power plants which would eventually produce 30MW hours of electricity, diverting more than 550,000 tonnes of waste from landfill. The GIB will spend 80m on that programme, with similar sums from private sources. The energy efficiency project to retrofit a number of factories run by Kingspan is expected to cut energy use by 15% at their sites. The industrialist Lord Smith, the chair of the GIB, said: &quot;The Green Investment Bank has the potential to be a game-changing component of the UK&apos;s low carbon economy, and a profitable centre of excellence in specialist and renewable investment.&quot; Fergus Ewing, the Scottish energy minister, is due to launch the Scottish government&apos;s &quot;boot camp&quot;  designed to help Scottish firms win backing from the bank  on Wednesday. The even will take place at a &quot;futuristic&quot; pyramid shaped building coated in solar panels in the former mining village of Bilston Glen near Edinburgh. &quot;Scotland campaigned hard to bring the Green Investment Bank to Edinburgh,&quot; Ewing said. &quot;Edinburgh presents the best Green Investment Bank location for the UK. Not only is the city a major financial centre, but Scotland already leads the world in renewable energy, and built up world leading expertise from the oil and gas industry.&quot;",

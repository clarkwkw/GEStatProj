    "text": "A burst of 13 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Google Wallet is leaking money &gt;&gt; Businessweek  Google Wallet, the mobile software that allows Android users to pay for purchases online and in stores with their phones, has become a money pit.The company has dedicated hundreds of developers to Wallet and spent about $300m to acquire digital payment startups to help develop the app. But consumers aren&apos;t sold. Wallet has been downloaded fewer than 10m times in the two years since its launch, according to Play, Google&apos;s app store.  Loses money on every transaction, according to the former head of Wallet, who left on 20 May. Recall too that it was reported that Larry Page blocked the idea of a Google credit card ahead of Google I/O. And the biggest US networks block Wallet on their phones.  Tell-all telephone &gt;&gt; De Zeit  Green party politician Malte Spitz sued to have German telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom hand over six months of his phone data that he then made available to ZEIT ONLINE. We combined this geolocation data with information relating to his life as a politician, such as Twitter feeds, blog entries and websites, all of which is all freely available on the internet.  You can think of ways in which this is both good and bad. Analyzing Yahoo&apos;s PRISM non-denial &gt;&gt; slight paranoia Christopher Soghoian, security and privacy researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union:   Yahoo&apos;s General Counsel posted a carefully worded denial regarding the company&apos;s alleged participation in the NSA PRISM program. To the casual observer, it might seem like a categorical denial. I do not believe that Yahoo&apos;s denial is as straightforward as it seems.  Basically, it denies lots of things that haven&apos;t been suggested in order to make it seem as though Yahoo isn&apos;t involved with the NSA&apos;s Prism. This time it&apos;s real: Google-Waze deal on the way &gt;&gt; AllThingsD Liz Gannes and Mike Isaac:   Waze will remain an independent entity for the time being, one source said, perhaps assuaging some fears that the tech giant will either outright kill or significantly alter the popular app. The deal would put an end to long-running speculation, fueled by leaks and tacit admissions, thatthe Israeli-founded mobile startup would end up in the hands of a major tech player. However, it&apos;s likely not going to be as easy as writing a check. There are not many global sources of mapping data: just Waze, Google, Navteq and TomTom. Thus, this would be a deal that attracts serious regulatory scrutiny  the political rigamarole that the search giant is all too familiar with at this point.  Even if it keeps Waze independent for a while, at some point it will have to integrate it - and bite the bullet over competition. Otherwise, it&apos;s just a favoured source of data - which it could get for a lot less than the reported $1.3bn. Obama Is Checking Your Email &gt;&gt; Tumblr He&apos;s a busy guy. Microsoft retrieves lost Windows Phone device with prototype software &gt;&gt; The Verge Tom Warren:   Jeremiah Wong purchased a Lumia 920 from eBay on June 5th from a seller located in Seattle. &quot;The phone in the pictures looked different,&quot; says Wong, speaking exclusively to The Verge. &quot;Mainly the Start Screen had the feedback hub, also etching on the back that read MSFT.&quot; Wong initially thought the device was a developer kit because it had the special etching alongside a cracked screen, but it was a lot more important. So important in fact that Microsoft wanted it back. After posting screenshots of the software running on the device, and accidentally revealing his cellphone number in the process, Wong was contacted by Microsoft&apos;s legal team. Microsoft locked the phone remotely and requested that Wong take down his photos from his Flickr account. &quot;Apparently the guy who owned it lost it on a bus. It was then picked up and sold,&quot; he says. Instead of pursuing Wong, Microsoft has offered to reimburse him for the cost of the device and also ship him a replacement phone. &quot;I was incredibly surprised at the lack of intimidation and even more surprised at their accommodation,&quot; says Wong.  It was running an early version of &quot;Windows Phone Blue&quot;. The screenshots suggest it will include a notification centre, among other improvements. Nice for someone not to get bullied by lawyers over a &quot;lost&quot; device. Carnivore (software) &gt;&gt; Wikipedia  Carnivore was a system implemented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was designed to monitor email and electronic communications. It used a customizable packet sniffer that can monitor all of a target user&apos;s Internet traffic. Carnivore was implemented in October 1997. By 2005 it had been replaced with improved commercial software such as NarusInsight.  Just in case you thought Prism and its kin were new. &apos;Draw Something&apos; studio OMGPOP reportedly shuttered amid Zynga layoffs &gt;&gt; The Verge  As we reported earlier this afternoon, Zynga is laying off 520 employees, a full 18% of its global workforce, and reportedly shutting down offices in Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York. What we didn&apos;t realize is that OMGPOP is Zynga New York. Now, OMGPOP&apos;s official Twitter account and some of its staffers are unsurprisingly tweeting that they&apos;re out of work, including community manager Joseph Alminawi and VP of outreach Ali Nicolas.  OMG it Popped. The real problem: couldn&apos;t adjust quickly enough to mobile. The most sophisticated Android Trojan &gt;&gt; Securelist Roman Unucheck at Kaspersky:   the cybercriminals found an error in the Android operating system which relates to the processing of the AndroidManifest.xml file. This file exists in every Android application and is used to describe the application&apos;s structure, define its launch parameters, etc. The malware modifies AndroidManifest.xml in such a way that it does not comply with Google standards, but is still correctly processed on a smartphone thanks to the exploitation of the identified vulnerability. All of this made it extremely difficult to run dynamic analysis on this Trojan. The creators of Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a also used yet another previously unknown error in the Android operating system. By exploiting this vulnerability, malicious applications can enjoy extended Device Administrator privileges without appearing on the list of applications which have such privileges. As a result of this, it is impossible to delete the malicious program from the smartphone after it gains extended privileges.  And with that the fun is only just beginning. This is reckoned to be one of the worst pieces of Android malware yet identified. Anonymous&apos; leaked NSA documents aren&apos;t new (or secret) &gt;&gt; The Daily Dot  The documents Anonymous claims to have leaked do not include the names any of the companies working on PRISM, nor do they explicitly mention PRISM at all. Instead, they contain a bunch of technical jargon, run-on sentences, acronyms, and details on the Global Information Grid (GIG) network. This network enables &quot;the secure, agile, robust, dependable, interoperable, data sharing environment for the department&quot;, states one of the documents provided by Anonymous. While this network has caught the interest of news organizations like TechCrunch, a mountain of seemingly identical documents on GIG can be found directly on the NSA&apos;s website.  Oh, Anonymous, you and your documents that you find on servers and claim you hacked. Why the tech company &apos;denials&apos; don&apos;t necessarily mean they weren&apos;t cooperating with NSA spying &gt;&gt; ThinkProgress  Following reports of a top secret program called PRISM that allows intelligence agencies to access a wide variety of supposedly private online communications, several of the tech companies implicated in the report have issued carefully worded statements denying the government has access to their servers or a backdoor method of entry. But that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) don&apos;t have the ability to access their data.  It&apos;s all in the wording. Downbeat Galaxy S4 view hits Samsung shares &gt;&gt; WSJ  Traders said the decline was triggered by a research note from J.P. Morgananalyst J.J. Park, who wrote that shipments of the Galaxy S4 for the thirdquarter would likely &quot;disappoint&quot; investors, resulting in lower-than-expectedmargins for Samsung. &quot;Our supply chain checks show monthly orders have been cut 20%-30% to 7 to 8million units (from 10 million) starting July,&quot; wrote Mr. Park. He downgradedSamsung&apos;s share price target to KRW1,900,000 from KRW2,100,000 previously. Samsung declined to comment Friday. The share price decline was reminiscent of the fall in Apple Inc. shares earlier this year, which was sparked by concernsover iPhone sales.  Guidance has been downgraded from 40m units in two quarters to about 25m in those same two quarters, some reports say.. How people read online: Why you won&apos;t finish this article &gt;&gt; Slate Magazine Farhad Manjoo:   Schwartz&apos;s data shows that readers can&apos;t stay focused. The more I type, the more of you tune out. And it&apos;s not just me. It&apos;s not just Slate. It&apos;s everywhere online. When people land on a story, they very rarely make it all the way down the page. A lot of people don&apos;t even make it halfway. Even more dispiriting is the relationship between scrolling and sharing. Schwartz&apos;s data suggest that lots of people are tweeting out links to articles they haven&apos;t fully read. If you see someone recommending a story online, you shouldn&apos;t assume that he has read the thing he&apos;s sharing.  Also explains comments which criticise something that&apos;s explained later in the story. Simple solution: put all the story into the first paragraph. Or something.

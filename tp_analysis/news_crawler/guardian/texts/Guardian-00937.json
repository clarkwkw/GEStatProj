    "text": "The decision by President Obama to reject a major new pipeline that would carry oil from Canadian tar sands into the US represents more than the president standing up to cynicism of Congressional Republicans and the threats of the oil industry to wreak electoral revenge in this year&apos;s election (United States: Setback for big oil: Obama rejects Keystone pipeline, 19 January). It is a major opportunity for David Cameron and Nick Clegg to withdraw their support for the Canadian government and Big Oil in pursuing what is one of the most environmentally destructive projects ever. All eyes are now on Europe where countries are debating proposals  the EU&apos;s fuel quality directive  that would effectively ban oil derived from tar sands from entering European forecourts. The UK should seize the opportunity that President Obama&apos;s brave stand has created, and stop lobbying against these proposals. Three months ago the Keystone pipeline looked sure to be approved; now the tar sands industry is facing realobstacles in getting to market. TheEuropean plan would be another important milestone in stopping the expansion of tar sands exploitation. Obama&apos;s decision hasn&apos;t just been praised by environmental groups, butalso by labour unions and thousandsof citizens across America and around the globe. Cameron can now also show international leadership. The world waits to see if he will side  like Obama  with the people, or with the polluters.Bill McKibbenSchumann Distinguished Scholar, Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont, US",

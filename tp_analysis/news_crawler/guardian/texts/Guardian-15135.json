    "text": "When is free not really, quite, free? Well, EA&apos;s shiny new addition to its high-spec driving series, Real Racing 3 (Firemonkeys, iOS/Android) won&apos;t charge you a penny to download it on to a chosen handset. So off you go, driving a gorgeously rendered automobile around a beautifully realistic track, swinging the handset from side to side to steer. The problems come at the end of the race. In-game currency has to be shelled out to repair the car, change the oil and generally keep it well tuned. It drains the resources to such an extent that if you want to upgrade the vehicle, or purchase a new one, it&apos;s nearly impossible without actually stumping up in all-too-real pounds. While the game itself is as enjoyable as ever, the balance between upgrading through skill or real-world wealth is all wrong. Cut the Rope: Time Travel (ZeptoLab, iOS, 69p/1.99), in contrast, also offers in-app purchases, but this sequel to the enjoyable physics puzzler doesn&apos;t make it a requirement to enjoy the game. As before, the aim is to feed monstrous OmNom some candy, but now he&apos;s joined by a fellow green blob  who changes outfits as the levels traverse the ages. It adds a variety to the challenge, without detracting from the expert craft of the puzzles, andmakesfor a sequel that builds upon what was great about the first instalment.",

    "text": "Skinks constitute the most species-rich radiation of lizards, with 1,455 described species. The actual number is certainly higher for at least two reasons. First, species continue to be described and there is no evidence we are yet approaching a complete inventory. And second, because many skinks are anatomically conservative, the status of many species and their evolutionary relationships remain controversial Madagascar has an especially rich skink fauna, second only to Australia. The almost 80 recognised Madagascan species are nearly all endemic to the island and more are reported each year. Scientists believe that this fauna represents three separate evolutionary radiations. Progress in sorting out species is limited by their secretive and burrowing habits, and the resultant small number of specimens available for study. Dr Aurlien Miralles of the Zoological Institute, Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, with colleagues JKhler, FGlaw and MVences have studied mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA and morphology of three nominal Madagascar species in an attempt to determine the actual species diversity. The results suggest that there are at least four distinct evolutionary lineages within this complex that deserve species status. One is Mstumpffi; one is a species new to science, which they describe as Marenicola; and the other two are species that are indistinguishable morphologically, one of which is more closely related to stumpffi and the new species than to the other identical form. Easily distinguished by DNA, it is not yet possible to determine the appropriate use of existing scientific names. The two available names, M polleni and Mintermedius, may or may not apply to just one of them. Thus the authors wisely opt to wait for additional specimens to work out the rest of this complex. M arenicola, like other skinks in the Madagascan lineage, has entirely scaly movable eyelids. Within the Scincidae, it differs from all other species in having two pairs of five-toed legs, light bronze dorsal colour with a pair of dark lateral stripes, and no postnasal scales. Molecular evidence places the species firmly in the genus. Its name was derived from the Latin arena (sand) and incola (inhabitant). The new species was discovered in the Fort d&apos;Orangea dune area and north of the Antsiranana bay in the Ampombofofo region of far northern Madagascar. Specimens were taken in pitfall traps and drift fences overnight on sandy soils in disturbed second-growth forests or shrubs. No specimens could be located above ground during the day and those captured were able to rapidly entrench themselves in sand. The authors&apos; study demonstrates the powerful combination of fieldwork, careful comparative morphology, DNA laboratory work, museum consultation of type specimens, and thoughtful phylogenetic analysis in exploring the diversity of species and accurate application of names.

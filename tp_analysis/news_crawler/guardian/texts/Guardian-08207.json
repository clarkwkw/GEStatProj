    "text": "When I start university this October, you may be surprised to know that the thing I am most looking forward to is meeting the international students. This is one of the reasons why I made the London School of Economics my first choice  I knew it was very multicultural, the complete opposite of the town in which I live. As the London Met visa scandal continues, it is clear many people have a perception of international students as immigration-rule dodgers at worst, or extremely lucky beneficiaries of a UK university education at best. But few people think about the extent to which students from abroad can improve the education experience for all those involved. International students bring much more than their money to the institutions that teach them. Of course, as Dr Tamson Pietsch writes: &quot;Overseas students have been a welcome source of income for British universities.&quot; When it comes to tuition fees, international students pay far more than home students. This alone is a strong incentive for UK universities to recruit from abroad. The money they bring in can be used to provide new facilities or improve old ones to the benefit of all students. There are further advantages: international students help sustain the UK&apos;s academic research, particularly when it comes to subjects like science, engineering and maths. With international students accounting for around 45% of the UK&apos;s postgraduate students, some research may not even be possible without international students wanting to undertake their studies in the UK. International students also have a significant impact on both national and regional economies, with a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills research paper estimating that they account for a contribution of around 8bn to the UK economy. This includes off-campus expenditure as well as their tuition fee contribution. A report by Oxford Economics estimated that the GDP generated by international students at the University of Exeter directly supported 2,480 jobs in the city. However, one of the most important benefits of international students is the way they diversify campus. Home students get a broader experience of life by learning alongside students from every corner of the globe. Personally, I feel meeting people with different values and beliefs will help me widen my cultural awareness, gain new perspectives and improve my social skills. I will be coming across people I probably wouldn&apos;t have met at all if I hadn&apos;t gone to university. LSE has a diverse range of societies that really reflect its multiculturalism, from the Czech and Slovak society to the Chile society. Many host events throughout the year, showcasing dance, music and drama. By attending, local students develop an interest in the culture and politics of other countries. In today&apos;s world, international students are good for UK universities and, more importantly, good for a multicultural Britain. It is essential that our universities offer them a supportive environment  for the sake of their home students as much as those from abroad.     Guardian students sign up banner  ",

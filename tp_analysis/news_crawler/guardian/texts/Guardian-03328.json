    "text": "Sony has announced God of War: Ascension, the latest title in its blockbusting swords-n-sorcery  or, more accurately, swords-n-butchery  series.  Due out on PS3 but with no release date set, the title will be a prequel to the God of War trilogy, following hack-happy Spartan warrior Kratos before he starts a war with the Gods of Ancient Greece. This game will apparently be all about the origins of Kratos &quot;as he takes his first steps on a now legendary quest for freedom,&quot; promises the press release.            Apart from the above teaser trailer, leaked line this morning, there&apos;s no other information just yet. Sony is expected to reveal much more at this year&apos;s E3 video game show in Los Angeles in June.",

    "text": " 8.51am: Welcome to the main event: Nintendo&apos;s E3 press conference at the Nokia Theatre, a stone&apos;s throw from the LA Convention Centre. Hopefully, what Nintendo has to show  the Wii U in its final form with a full portfolio of games  will create the biggest splash at the 2012 E3. It&apos;s all kicking off at 9am PST  let&apos;s hope this flaky Wi-Fi holds up ...  9.02am: Shigeru Miyamoto walks on stage to thunderous applause ... the Nintendo guru has the crowd in his hand, as ever  9.04am: Nintendo has started off with Miyamoto on stage, playing some augmented reality magic by making Pikmin characters appear on members of the audience. Nintendo are sooo cuddly.  9.05am: Miyamoto says the Wii U has the first independent controller screen in game history. Hmm, what about the Dreamcast VMU, Miyamoto?  9.06am: &quot;Wii U will change how you watch TV in the living room,&quot; says Shigs. But then he reveals the new Pikmin 3, the popular action management game. The visuals are lovely  this is already a well-known title, but lets see if we find some new details...  9.08am: In Pikmin 3, the little characters you control can find building materials like twigs and leaves. They also have a new Pikmin who can aim and fire objects to breakdown barriers. The intuitive controls allow you to target Pikmin at specific enemy parts -like their eyes. The visuals are really nice and bright  so cute.  9.09am: The touchscreen controls allow you to manipulate the map seamlessly, allowing you to access areas of the world more smoothly. Miyamoto says this will make the game tactically deeper, especially now that you can control up to four leader pikmins.  9.11am: Miyamoto says users are moving toward lighter games and publishers have to meet that audience. Pikmin 3 is interesting though  quite a complex strategy title that hides its management depth behind those luscious visuals.  9.12am: Miyamoto find a Pikmin character in his jacket. Bless him, he&apos;s off the stage now. Reggie Fils-Aime the head of Nintendo America is up now.  9.12am: Reggie has promised 23 new titles at the conference. &quot;It&apos;s all about the games,&quot; he tells us  the opposite to the message that Sony and Microsoft have been sending out.  9.13am: At its core Wii U does three things: it changes your gaming, it changes how you interact with your friends and it changes the way you interact with your TV. &quot;It stands to revolutionise your living room&quot;. Ah, THAT&apos;S more like Sony and Microsoft!  9.15am: There will be no TV announcements about Wii U today says Reggie  it&apos;s just about the games and the communication with friends.  9.16am: Reggie&apos;s telling us to follow Nintendo on Twitter, Facebook and online for new Wii U info. &quot;The new disruption: asymmetric gameplay&quot;  on Wii U, players will compete in different ways in same game.  9.17am: BIG NEWS: Wii U *will* support two GamePads at the same time. A crucial, crucial factor. This is hugely important for games like Madden where players will be able to use GamePads as playbooks for planning moves without another player in the same room seeing it. Crucial!  9.18am: A video is now showing off all the features and buttons on the GamePad, including analogue sticks, stereo speakers, mic and camera, and Home button which will suspend a game so you can connect with friends or check for game updates.  9.19am: We&apos;re on to Miiverse, the new social network for Wii U. The first thing you see when you switch on the console is a Miiverse &quot;main street&quot; a sort of visual reproduction of your social network. All your friends will appear as Miis on your screen. They all gather around specific tiles, which show trending Nintendo games, as well as titles that individual friends are playing.  9.20am: You can use speech bubbles to send messages to your Miiverse friends. You can also send screenshots to friends. And the speech bubble shows emoticons as well so you can communicate your state of mind to friends. So it&apos;s sort of social network, texting and tweeting simultaneously. On your TV screen.  9.22am: Reggie introduces New Super Mario Bros. U  a new Mario game! It will allow you to connect with other players who are chatting about the game  a real-time social window that opens up while you&apos;re playing.  9.23am: So yes, New Super Mario Bros. U is clearly a new take on the New Super Mario Bros. Mii demo shown off at last year&apos;s E3. A 2D scrolling platformer, with Mario, gold coins, platforms... and it can be transferred from the TV screen to personal play on GamePad. There&apos;s also a boost mode, with up to four people using their Wii motes to get through screen  you can set speed run records and share them in Miiverse.  9.25am: Batman: Arkham Asylum is on screen with Harley Quinn talking to Reggie! Martin Tremblay of Warner Bros comes on stage to talk about dark knights on Wii U...  9.26am: Tremblay says that the Wii U version of Batman Arkham City will be unique. It will be subtitled Armored Edition. You can direct the GamePad around to scan the in-game environment  a neat little feature.  9.28am: The game is being developed by WB Games&apos; Montreal studio, not by Rocksteady. During combat, Batman&apos;s new suit has a powerful super special moves feature, which can be activated using the GamePad screen.  9.31am: Also, the GamePad accelerometers can be used to guide flying missiles as they go toward a target. That&apos;s rather nice. The GamePad can also be used to highlight and set off Batman&apos;s planted explosives.  9.32am: Warner Bros is bringing in the popular Scribblenauts series to Wii U. It&apos;s sold 4 million copies on DS - and makes total sense for Wii U.  9.33am: The new version is Scribblenauts Unlimited. It has gorgeous HD cartoon visuals and allows you to think of new objects then create them onscreen to put in the game or share with friends. A trailer onscreen shows someone creating a dog car  a dog with wheels. That can then go in the game. Is this actually happening? A dog with wheels? The tag line is &quot;Imagine anything, explore everything.&quot; Basically, instead of writing words as in the previous games, you draw pictures to interact with the game world. Lovely.  9.33am: We&apos;re getting a sizzle real of upcoming games: Darksiders II, Mass Effect 3, Tank! Tank! Tank! from Namco, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Trine 2: Director&apos;s Cut, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor&apos;s Edge and Aliens Colonial Marines. Big emphasis on traditional action games there.  9.34am: Reggie is moving on to music and fitness titles  the bread and butter of the Wii experience. He&apos;s dissing the old Wii Fit Board  even though it has virtually made the Wii  they sold more than 43m copies of Wii Fit. What are they up to now?  9.35am: Wii Fit U announced!  9.36am: A trailer shows a couple getting ready to play The woman steps on to her Wii Fit board, but also places the GamePad in front  it monitors her performance and offers stats on the mini-screen. The man in the video uses the GamePad as a weight. All the mini-games on screen feed your calorie burning stats into the game and you can compete to lose more with other members of your household. And if someone else is watching TV, there are Wii Fit U games that just use the GamePad.  9.38am: Sing is a new performance game where everyone plays. It&apos;s a working title and Freestyle Games form lovely Leamington are making it. The GamePad displays the lyrics to songs and everyone can sing along together.  9.38am: It looks like different players are prompted in to the song at different times, so everyone gets solos, but there are also group bits like choruses. This is going to be IMMENSE with the karaoke gaming crowd.  9.39am: We&apos;re on to 3DS now with Scott Moffitt, head of sales at Nintendo America.  9.40am: Tomorrow night at 6pm Pacific, Nintendo is doing a full one-hour live webcast dedicated to 3DS games. Wow, they&apos;ve totally sidelined the handheld device today.  9.41am: Still, we&apos;re getting New Super Mario Bros 2 for 3DS. It&apos;s different form the Wii U game  it&apos;s all about collecting gold coins. Players can generate more with their in-game actions. It&apos;s coming out in the US on 19 August.  9.43am: We&apos;re getting a new Paper Mario game, complete with stickers. The whole world is plastered with them. You collect them by pulling them off the scenery and they become your battle commands  choose a shoe sticker to stamp on an enemy, for example. Paper Mario Sticker Star arrives this winter as a physical and digital release.  9.44am: Ah, here we are moving on to Luigi&apos;s Mansion 2. Now he has multiple mansions each with its own mission-based challenges. there&apos;s a new heavier emphasis on ghost catching  and there are new types of spooks, all requiring different ghost-capturing tactics. That one&apos;s coming out at Christmas too. Ho, ho, and indeed, ho.  9.46am: We&apos;re getting a quick third-party teaser video now. The titles are: Castlevania: Lords of Shadow  Mirror of Fate, Disney Epic Mickey, Scribblenauts Unlimited and Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. We knew about a lot of those, but nice to see &apos;em anyway.  9.49am: Back to Wii u and Lego City Undercover is a new Lego adventure which allows you to use your GamePad screen to solves mysteries and scan for hidden enemies  again, you move the GamePad around to expore the area - just like Arkham City. The little lego criminals are so adorable  if only crime really was this cute. The game has exploration and athletic building climbing features.  9.50am: Reggie has moved on to Ubisoft, who also featured heavily in the Sony presentation yesterday. Yves Guillemot, the CEO of Ubisoft comes to the stage.  9.52am: Yves mentions Rayman Legends and ZombiU on Wii U  he&apos;s talking about how the Nintendo vision aligns with Ubi&apos;s, and how asymmetrical gaming is the future.  9.54am: Ubisoft&apos;s Xavier Poix is on stage to show of Just Dance 4. You can dance as a team, selecting moves on the GamePad. Sort of live choreography. So one player is the dance master and the others are his puppets of dance. Nice.  9.56am: Now we&apos;re onto a trailer for ZombiU, a dark action adventure that lets you use the GamePad as an inventory but also a scanner for scary zombies. And of course, it can be turned into a sniper scope, so you move the GamePad around to target enemies on your TV screen. That accelerometer is going to be worn out! Looks amazingly atmospheric and tense. Lots of big zombie apocalypse shocks. Good stuff.  9.57am: The game also has a mini-mode that lets you point the GamePad camera at a friend and turn them into a zombie on your screen. Reggie makes a terrifying zombie. He won&apos;t stop. &quot;I&apos;m coming to eat you,&quot; he threatens. He&apos;s totally immersed himself in this role.  9.58am: A quick bunch of Ubisoft games  Rayman, Avengers Battle for the Earth, Assassin&apos;s Creed III, Rabbids Land, etc. Lots of support from the French publisher as expected. Ubisoft is really getting around. The world&apos;s flirtiest publisher. Is &apos;flirtiest&apos; a word?  10.01am: Reggie is now talking about NintendoLand - this is the new Wii Sports essentially. Katsuya Eguchi the Wii U software producer at Nintendo Japan is showing off the game. It&apos;s a sort of theme park where your Mii can go and try out attractions. So it&apos;s Wii Sports meets Disneyland. There are 12 attractions in the game, each themed around a classic Nintendo franchise  eg, Luigi&apos;s Mansion, Donkey Kong&apos;s Crash Course, etc.  10.03am: You can visit the park with other players or go it alone. The game also connects with Miiverse to create a sort of global social theme park. I think. Frankly this is all moving too fast.  10.05am: One player with a GamePad can take on special role when playing with other friends who have Wii Remotes. Another asymmetric feature, like Just Dance 4. In the Luigi&apos;s Ghost Mansion attraction  the player with the GamePad will be able to direct the scary experiences others have as they explore the environment. The Wii Remote players have to work together to survive. The GamePad players sees all the other players on the game screen, but the players can&apos;t see the ghost who the GamePad player is controlling. The Wii Remotes rumble when the invsible ghost is near  players will need to co-operate telling each other when they&apos;re rumbling to get the ghost. They then use their torches to &apos;burn&apos; the ghost.  10.06am: When the ghost attacks a human, the human faints. If the ghost gets everyone it&apos;s game over. But humans can revive the downed pal by shining their torches on him. This is cool and remember it&apos;s just one of the 12 attractions in the Amusement Park game...  10.07am: That was quite a simple mini-game that they&apos;ve made quite a meal of explaining. CORRECTION: Its called NintendoLand, not Amusement Park!  10.09am: After a delightful trailer, Reggie is back on stage. NintendoLand will launch with the Wii U hardware this winter.  10.10am: Go to e3.nintendo.com to see trailers of games like NintendoLand and ZombiU  10.11am: &quot;Families in the same room, today distracted by their personal devices, will soon be interacting together,&quot; says Reggie. Nintendo is trying to save our families! Save us Nintendo! Save us!  10.12am: Reggie is off now, but we get one final look at NintendoLand, which is clearly the big launch title for Wii U. No launch date or price info today though. It&apos;s all about the content  as Nintendo said it would be.  10.14am: Some interesting stuff there  with two key gaming themes: using the GamePad as a motion controller with its own screen, and using the GamePad for asymmetric gaming experiences in which one player with the GamePad gets to direct the gameplay of others, or at least interact with the game in a fundamentally different way  see NintendoLand&apos;s Luigi game and Just Dance 4 with its choreography. Neat stuff. But is it enough to see off the attack of Microsoft and its sneaky SmartGlass technology?",

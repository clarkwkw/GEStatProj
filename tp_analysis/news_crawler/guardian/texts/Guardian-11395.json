    "text": "The government has announced plans to allow school leavers to become lawyers and accountants without first gaining degrees. Matthew Hancock, the minister for skills, said he wanted to expand the apprenticeship scheme to offer qualifications at the same level as a master&apos;s degree without years of university study. &quot;At the moment, to become qualified as a solicitor, accountant or in insurance, the typical route involves three years at university, then on the job training and professional qualifications. But university is not for everyone. There is no reason why you can&apos;t attain the same qualifications, without the degree, starting on the job training in an apprenticeship from day one,&quot; he wrote in an article in the Daily Telegraph. &quot;So I want apprenticeships spanning craft, technical and professional jobs that open up work-based routes to the top.&quot; The government has funded around 30 employers, including the accountancy firm PwC and construction company Balfour Beatty, with 25m to provide new qualifications for their apprentices. At present apprentices can reach the level of a foundation degree after four years. The Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills announcement envisages apprentices continuing study for up to eight years to attain the equivalent of a master&apos;s degree. Hancock wrote: &quot;There are successful higher apprenticeship schemes already in place, at levels four and five, equivalent to the first year of a degree course and foundation degree levels respectively. I now want to see more courses that truly match graduate and postgraduate qualifications. &quot;From next year, apprenticeships at levels six and seven  bachelor&apos;s and master&apos;s degree level  will be officially recognised for the first time.&quot; Student numbers in England and Wales have fallen by 57,000 in the last year largely because of the increase in tuition fees. The apprentice scheme will allow some school leavers to work and study at the same time, if an employer is willing to fund it. &quot;Higher apprenticeships, like all apprenticeships, are employer-led. So to ensure their success and go further, we need more employers to step up to take advantage of the opportunity,&quot; said Hancock. The minister said Britain&apos;s economic progress has been slowed by a lack of respect for learning in the workplace. &quot;For decades, Britain has been held back by artificial and counter-productive divisions between practical and academic learning, allowing countries such as Germany to get ahead in the global race for technical excellence,&quot; he said. The government&apos;s announcement was inspired by a report this year by Doug Richards, a businessman who appears in the television show Dragons&apos; Den. Richards told the government that apprenticeships should have parity with degrees. The government is in talks with the BPP Law School over an apprenticeship that will lead to a qualification as a solicitor and PricewaterhouseCoopers is developing a master&apos;s-level apprenticeship for a qualification in audit, accountancy or tax, Hancock wrote.",

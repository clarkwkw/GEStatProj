    "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was once implacable on the issue of capital controls. Member states were told to dismantle restrictions on the free movement of money around the world, as important for the smooth running of the global economy as the free movement of goods. In those heady days, the IMF had a set view about how the world should be run. Markets should be as free as possible, poor countries should privatise state-run industries and open themselves up to inward investment. Restrictive barriers were to be dismantled, taxes cut, public spending squeezed. There was no risk from the speculative activities of banks and no danger that housing bubbles would get out of hand. Precious little of the once all-conquering Washington consensus has escaped scrutiny, including the blanket opposition to capital controls. This week, the IMF published its latest thinking on capital market liberalisation. Its conclusion? Controls on capital had their uses, countries should dismantle controls only when they were absolutely sure they could cope with the possible hot money flows that might result, and should have the right to take action to prevent their economies being blown out of the water either by the rapid exchange-rate appreciation that accompanies rapid inflows of foreign money or the depreciation that accompanies its departure. Here are a few snippets from what the IMF calls its &quot;institutional view&quot; on capital flows. For starters: &quot;Capital flows can have substantial benefits for countries. At the same time, they also carry risks, even for countries that have long been open and drawn benefits from them.&quot; Then there&apos;s this: &quot;Liberalisation needs to be well planned, timed and sequenced to ensure that its benefits outweigh the costs.&quot; And: &quot;Rapid capital inflow surges or disruptive outflows can create policy challenges. Appropriate policy responses involve both countries that are recipients of capital flows and those from which flows originate.&quot; Let&apos;s be clear. The IMF still thinks that in an ideal world there would be free movement of capital. This, though, is clearly not an ideal world and many IMF member states  Brazil, for one  have introduced capital controls after excessive appreciation of their currencies stifled export growth. In essence, what is happening is a reversion to the days before the Washington consensus, when the judicious use of capital controls was seen as necessary if countries were going to be able to pursue domestic policy goals such as full employment without the fear of being blown out of the water. The difference is that capital controls tended to be used in the old days by countries worried about their currencies being driven down; now they appeal to countries who want to stop them going up. In a world where just about every country is trying to export its way back to prosperity, capital controls are once again part of the toolkit for policymakers, and the IMF is now adopting a much less dogmatic approach than it did in the runup to the crisis. The change of heart is belated, but necessary and welcome.",

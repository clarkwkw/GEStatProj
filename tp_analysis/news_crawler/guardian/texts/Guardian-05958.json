    "text": "Around 50,000 people are beginning to descend on Rio de Janeiro this weekend for the Rio+20 sustainable development conference, the biggest meeting the UN has ever organised. As well as the talks at the Riocentro Convention Centre, the city is set to be home to colourful spectacles staged by civil society, including the People&apos;s Summit for social and environmental justice.  People are already sharing great photographs of the people, debates and events on Flickr  and we&apos;d like to invite you to share yours on our Rio+20 Flickr group. We&apos;ll feature the best on the Guardian site, and potentially the print edition too. You can follow the latest news, comment and developments on our dedicated Rio+20 page.",

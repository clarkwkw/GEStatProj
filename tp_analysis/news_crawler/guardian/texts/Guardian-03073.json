    "text": "One afternoon when the weather was glorious, Borrowdale&apos;s volcanic crags facing the sun gleamed white. It must have been a quirk of atmospherics as the skylines were hazy, yet these fellside cliffs above the shores of Derwentwater reflected the rays like shields forged from platinum. Rarely has White Buttress on Walla Crag appeared to be so well-named. Even Black Crag, farther along the valley towards the Jaws of Borrowdale, with its morbidly named ascents like Shroud, Rigor Mortis and Mortician, looked like the Wall of Early Morning Light on El Capitan in Yosemite as climbed by Harding and Caldwell in 1970. Upper and Lower Falcon Crags, overlooking lakeside trees still bare as inverted broomsticks, were another two such cliffs, the latter with routes such as the Niche and Dedication that were picked out whiter-than-white by the sun. So too was Gowder Crag, towering beyond Kettlewell car park, beloved of visitors who enjoy the shingle beach and walk up to Lodore Falls (as immortalised by Robert Southey&apos;s onomatopoeic poem). Located on the beck that dashes down rocks from lofty Watendlath Tarn, these cataracts can carry rainbow trout from the tarn over the edge to land swimming unscathed in the pool 100 ft below, though the flow has dwindled in these dry conditions. Across the falls is the row of buttresses above the trees known as Shepherd&apos;s Crag  thronged with climbers in good weather on routes like Bludgeon, Ardus, Adam and Eve. Even this early in the year an intrepid leader could be seen reaching high on the slab of Aaros. Sunlit rock, ah! Shepherd&apos;s, incidentally, resembles the red granite of the French Alps, hence the name of the classic climb Little Chamonix. Why these cliffs should catch the light so blatantly is beyond me, yet light has been allowed to penetrate through its natural filter of deep haze to reach the rockfaces and show them at their best.",

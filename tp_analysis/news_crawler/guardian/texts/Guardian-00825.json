    "text": "The evolution of books into interactive, digital products is far from over, according to Henry Volans, head of digital publishing at Faber &amp; Faber.  Speaking at the Independent Publishers Guild&apos;s Digital Quarterly meeting in London, Volans said there is plenty more scope for innovation in book-apps and ebooks. &quot;The phrase which keeps coming up in my mind about ebooks is evolution,&quot; he said. &quot;I have absolute certainty that we have not reached anything close to the evolutionary ideal of the ebook I find it absolutely inconceivable that the book can&apos;t evolve and change and grow.&quot; In his role at Faber, Volans commissioned the iPad edition of The Waste Land, working with partner company Touch Press on the tablet version of T.S. Eliot&apos;s poem. Volans picked out Thames &amp; Hudson&apos;s Cyclepedia iPad app as another good example of book-app innovation during his speech at the event. &quot;It seems a good example of an e-book that does justice to an art book,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s visually stunning, it&apos;s also practical  the best visual glossary explaining the components of a bike that I&apos;ve seen, by some distance. But it&apos;s a work of passion too, and it&apos;s exciting to see things like that coming along. That&apos;s not an app, it&apos;s an ebook. A digital edition of an art book.&quot; Also speaking at the event was Dan Franklin, digital publisher at Random House. He warned the publishing industry not to treat digital as a silo. &quot;Digital publishing now is publishing. This should now be in everyone&apos;s heads as a completely integral part of what we do. Even though, yes, at the moment it&apos;s 10% of the market. But by the end of this year it should be 20%,&quot; he said. While Random House has released several apps, Franklin has also commissioned a series of &quot;shorts&quot; ebooks between 10,000 and 15,000 words in length. This includes an initiative called Storycuts, which unbundles more than 250 short stories from backlist collections by authors including Julian Barnes, Irvine Welsh, Rose Tremain and Ruth Rendell, and sells them individually on e-book stores from Amazon, Apple and others for low prices. &quot;This is following the iTunes models in selling stories in exactly the same model that they sell singles,&quot; said Franklin. &quot;I think there&apos;s an opportunity to do something with short stories  to look at them as digital pop music, if the novel is a symphony.&quot; He also suggested that short stories could help publishers compete with the wave of ultra-cheap fiction being sold at rock-bottom prices on the main ebook stores. &quot;Testing the shortform area and pricing appropriately is one of the best ways of countering the notion that something should be 99p if it&apos;s 100,000 words long,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a crucial thing that we should be worrying about.&quot; This concern about cheap, low-quality competition is also felt by book-app publishers. London publisher Nosy Crow releases both physical books and original book-apps aimed at children, and its digital project and marketing manager Tom Bonnick said the need for quality apps was what spurred the company to start making them. &quot;If we didn&apos;t, and other people didn&apos;t make apps like ours  people who cared about reading and literacy and those important developmental skills  other people would make apps who didn&apos;t care about those, and they wouldn&apos;t be very good.&quot; Bonnick admitted that making apps like Nosy Crow&apos;s Cinderella and Bizzy Bear on the Farm is an expensive business, and while he did not have any sales figures to share, said the company sees a payoff on its decision not to cut corners. &quot;We didn&apos;t shy away from the fact that the apps would cost money. You see a return on quality: they&apos;re well-made and people respect that. And we can sell them at a good price.&quot; The IPG event also saw talks from new startups hoping to shake up the way e-books are distributed and consumed across a range of devices. Bilbary was founded by Tim Coates, former managing director of Waterstones. The company is touting its cloud-based ebooks service that runs across smartphones, tablets and even games consoles. Publishers can choose to sell and/or rent their ebooks, taking 80% of the income. They can also run their own virtual &quot;shop windows&quot; on the Bilbary site promoting their titles. &quot;We&apos;ve cast it as Bilbary Town Library, and the site is about readers: helping readers to find what they want to read: lots of recommendations where you&apos;ll be able to see who&apos;s making the recommendations,&quot; said Coates. Meanwhile, Majoobi&apos;s service helps book publishers create their own HTML5-based web stores for people to browse, buy and read their ebooks. The stores can be bookmarked on the homescreens of smartphones and tablets for easy access. Chief executive Ayman Mackouly pitched the technology as a way for publishers to go direct to consumers, cutting out retail middlemen. &quot;If you have 50 books, you will have your own store. You don&apos;t have to rely on Apple, you don&apos;t have to rely on Amazon,&quot; he said, suggesting that the Financial Times&apos; popular HTML5 app, which has more than 1m registered users, should serve as inspiration for book publishers. The IPG event also saw a presentation by Oxfam Publishing&apos;s Helen Moreno, outlining the charity&apos;s effort to digitise its archive of publications. The company distributes them through its own Policy &amp; Practice website, as well as through online documents service Scribd. Oxfam also launched its first ebook on Amazon and Apple&apos;s stores in October 2011 as a free download. &quot;Since the launch it&apos;s done about 10,000 units, which is pretty good for us in terms of reaching a whole other audience in a digital format,&quot; said Moreno. &quot;It is mission-driven publishing, we&apos;re much more interested in the messages than in making money. In fact, we&apos;re desperate to give it away!&quot;",

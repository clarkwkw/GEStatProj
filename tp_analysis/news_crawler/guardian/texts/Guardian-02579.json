    "text": "Twitter&apos;s UK general manager Tony Wang expects broadcasters to start using the microblogging service in more &quot;artful&quot; ways beyond showing hashtags and account handles on-air. &quot;Broadcasters are not the ones to choose whether to have social TV. It happens whether they like it or not. But they have a choice about how to harness that social TV energy,&quot; he told the MIPCube conference in Cannes. Wang cited stats showing that 80% of under-25s are using a second screen to communicate with friends while watching TV, while 72% of them are using Twitter, Facebook and other mobile apps to comment on the shows they watch. He added that Twitter sees three distinct strategies from broadcasters when it comes to social TV: some are doing nothing, others are doing something, and a few are doing &quot;artful&quot; things on-air. &quot;It&apos;s the past, present and future of social TV.&quot; Wang outlined three common tactics in the &quot;do something&quot; category: on-air hashtags, Twitter handles and live-tweets from stars. Examples: tweets using the hashtag #oscars spiked massively when broadcaster ABC showed it on-screen, while Piers Morgan adds between 650 and 700 new followers a minute when his @piersmorgan handle is shown on-screen during his CNN show. Meanwhile, CBS saw the number of daily tweets about its Survivor show quadruple in 2011 after presenter Jeff Probst began tweeting while it was on-air. Wang hit back at comments made in January by the BBC&apos;s director of policy and strategy John Tate, who told a London conference that &quot;interactivity has its place but you don&apos;t want to overdo it  shows like Sherlock and Frozen Planet on the BBC are very intense for the viewer and need people not to be distracted.&quot; Wang disagrees, and showed a series of tweets during his MIPCube speech from fans of Frozen Planet saying how much they were enjoying it, or providing feedback on the show. &quot;People are definitely engaging with the shows whether it&apos;s a social programme... or something that&apos;s more intense and serious, as that BBC article had mentioned,&quot; said Wang, who claimed social media both attracts new viewers to shows, and retains their interest over the course of a series. Wang finished off by giving some examples of more artful use of Twitter by broadcasters, including Fox News encouraging viewers of the Republican presidential debates to tweet candidates&apos; names plus #answer or #dodge to vote on whether the candidates had been facing or dodging questions. The broadcaster analysed the data during the debate show, and during breaks showed graphs on-screen to show who was perceived as dodging which questions. Twitter is also seeing more broadcasters experiment with drama shows, where additional storylines are played out through tweets from fictional characters. &quot;Living out a parallel storyline during breaks between seasons and breaks between episodes,&quot; he said. &quot;The storylines continue off-air and onto Twitter.&quot;",

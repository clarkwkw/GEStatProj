    "text": "Jenny Harris, who has died of cancer aged 67, was the inspired and inspiring head of the National Theatre&apos;s education department from 1990 to 2007. She took over a small, peripheral unit and made it an indispensable part of the NT. The work was directed towards helping young people and teachers to learn through theatre. In 17 years she made the department a paradigm for educational schemes in all arts organisations. Jenny launched several exceptional initiatives. The most remarkable was National Connections, which was conceived in 1992. It still endures: 10 plays by established writers are specially commissioned and as many as 300 youth theatres perform one of these plays at regional festivals all over the UK, monitored and assessed by representatives of the NT. The best of these groups then appear at a festival later in the year at the Olivier theatre. She was responsible for many excellent small-scale national tours, and for a primary education programme which conscripted NT actors and directors to work in schools with children and teachers. She instigated a social regeneration scheme for young people that aimed to transform lives through theatre, as well as starting a highly successful programme to develop creative leadership. She was prescient about the importance of digital information and the power of the internet and, well before it was either fashionable or mandatory for arts organisations, she set up an interactive website that opened up the NT to virtual visitors. Jenny was born and brought up in south London, and gained a first in sociology at LSE, followed by a master&apos;s in criminology from Berkeley in the US. In 1970, Jenny initiated and developed the Combination  a company set up to run a cultural and community development project in Brighton, the first of a new generation of multifunctional cultural development and social action centres. There was a resident theatre company, a bar and cafe, photography and video workshops, and theatre and dance projects for all ages. In 1972 the company became resident at the Albany Empire in Deptford, south-east London. As executive director of the project, Jenny worked tirelessly for years to fund and oversee the design, building and running of the purpose-built arts centre that opened in 1981. She was often impatient with the NT&apos;s &quot;culture&quot;, geared as it was (and is) around producing roughly 20 plays a year in three auditoriums, and she would often argue with me about its inflexibility. But we never fell out and she remained a firm and fond friend. She was unfailingly generous to those she worked with. Countless actors, directors and producers can testify to her encouragement and her effect as a catalyst for change in their work and their lives. She was passionate, visionary and determined; she will be much missed. Jenny is survived by John Turner, her husband of 42 years, her older brother David and nephew Ben.",

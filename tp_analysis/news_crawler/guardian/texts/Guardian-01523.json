    "text": "    Many sporting events begin with a coin toss, where the winning team usually makes the choice for who handles the ball at the beginning of the game. At the beginning of the Superbowl, there is a coin toss where the winning team decides whether they will kick or receive the ball.

Our favourite mathematician, Dr James Grime, provides a few answers:              Visit numberphile&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

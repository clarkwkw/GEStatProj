    "text": "Dr Janine Utell, chair and associate professor of English, Widener University, Pennsylvania Leaders are supposed to further the purpose of higher education: If our purpose is to teach and research, to facilitate student learning and to add to the body of human knowledge, to innovate and develop and disseminate new ideas, then the particular task of leaders in HE - what makes it different from other corporate or organisational models - is to further that purpose. Certainly the qualities that make leaders in other areas effective, even transformational, should be valued, but they should be in service to the particular purpose of higher education. The qualities a leader should have: They should be able to effectively navigate the discourse community of leadership and management, and the discourse community of the university. In other words, which language do you speak, and when, and to whom. I have, for example, no idea what &apos;business facing&apos; means, and I&apos;m not sure how far I&apos;d get with my faculty if I pulled that one on them. Also, leadership isn&apos;t just about getting things done. It&apos;s about the people you&apos;re leading being convinced you&apos;re the right person for the job, and for academics that means having a sense that the visionary at the front of the room is one of them. Resources: Practical wisdom and professorial life: I wrote about leadership qualities, and how they connect to purpose in higher education in a blog for the Chronicle of Higher Ed Benjamin Ginsberg&apos;s recent The Fall of the Faculty also talks about the clash of purposes in higher ed leadership. Professor Craig Mahoney, chief executive, The Higher Education Academy There is no one way to find good leaders: The identification of outstanding leaders in any business or pursuit, is highly complex. I think that diverse assessment techniques, including psychometric tests are part of a package of measures that are useful in minimising poor choices. But there is no one right solution. Support given to interview panels/groups is as equally important as the training or development of candidates pre and post-appointment. Stereotypes of the profile of an outstanding leader are potentially dangerous in making recruitment decisions, and diverse recruitment processes need to be encouraged more. What is required for the future? Careful nurturing support for the development of leaders from an early age. How great would it be to have a VC aged under 30? Why shouldn&apos;t that be possible? Higher education needs creative leaders: The creative side of leadership, at all levels in an organisation, can be difficult to identify or develop. It&apos;s somewhat similar to entrepreneurial skills: while you can teach about enterprise, you can&apos;t make someone an entrepreneur. The ability to deliver creative solutions and take good leadership decisions without solid or compelling &apos;evidence&apos; has been in my experience, the difference between outstanding leaders and others. Furthermore, a new funding model, which varies across the four nations, will provide fantastic opportunity for creative leadership and innovative change in all aspects of higher education. We need leaders who will be dynamic and responsive to multiple challenges and opportunities. William H Graves, senior vice-president, academic strategy, Ellucian, providers of education technology Leaders must rethink the traditional ways of running institutions: Consider, for example, E G Wells&apos; warning from 1920: &quot;Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.&quot; More than 90 years after Wells&apos; warning, I continue to believe that education is the best-bet solution to humankind&apos;s challenge to advance and sustain economic, environmental and social justice on a global scale. If education itself is to remain sustainable (as our best bet for avoiding or resolving civilisation&apos;s urgent threats), then education leaders must become more willing to re-examine its traditional constructs - campuses, contact hours, and so on - in order to focus on scaling up and affording quality-assured degrees in an equal-opportunity education pipeline that includes a growing proportion of needy students. Here&apos;s an example to illustrate this: I&apos;m a member of the board of governors of Antioch University, which is a US-based independent, non-profit, one-university system of regional campuses and other programs committed to social justice and experiential learning. We recently searched for and appointed a new chancellor for the university. The successful candidate, Felice Nudelman, will bring not only the traditional values and experiences of higher education to the leadership position, but also pragmatic, alternative leadership and management experience from her role as executive director of the New York Times. Antioch was looking for the kind of leadership described above, and Ms Nudelman is well positioned to provide that leadership. Money is necessary to fund education: Academic culture, which I enjoyed for 30 plus years, often views money as corrupting. Money can certainly be corrputing, however, I see education as a &apos;common good&apos; and money is needed to sustain its provision. A vexing leadership challenge is to find an economic governance mechanism that will allow all of the different economic beneficiaries of educational attainment to collaborate in order to sustain and mutually afford the common good of educational attainment. Resource:  Adaptive leadership: establishing an education leadership commons. This is the draft paper I wrote on how to integrate and aggregate micro results to achieve macro goals. Dr Richard Hall, head of enhancing learning through technology, De Montfort University Leadership ought to be about ideals and not money: My concern relates to HEIs merely reflecting rather than fighting the hegemonic ideology being imposed by the coalition government. This feels like it ought to be about the battle of ideas, and yet the ground has been ceded to the rule of money. There appears to be little space for pushing back against this narrative. So we are all competing, internationalising, chasing externally-imposed metrics, buying into outsourcing, focusing learning and teaching on employability and so on, with no critique. The HE sector may now become subject to the same transnational governance logic that places bankers in charge of national governments in order to implement austerity packages and quieten the markets. This then damages a university&apos;s identity. What is the role of the university as a leadership space in that conversation? And what is the role of VCs or pro-VCs in that discussion? Consensus is vital for HE leadership: I worry that HE has lost its purpose, and that its current leadership are not able to reorient it beyond value-for-money, efficiency gains, business-process re-engineering, competitive edge. We face global socio-environmental and economic crises, and the role and responsibilities of universities is important. If we simply focus on our sustainability (in spite of the fact that, as Lehman Brothers employees will tell you, nothing is sustainable), then we risk being borked. That is how I see leadership of the university beyond the university. If it is not about consensus then we risk being focused on power over something/someone, and not on our shared power to recreate the world. Resource: I blog about the above issues in greater detail here. Paul Gentle, director of programmes, Leadership Foundation for Higher Education (LFHE) Demands for leadership training for academic staff is on the increase: At the Leadership Foundation, we&apos;ve seen an increase in demand - and more so in very specific contexts of institutional needs. There&apos;s a trend towards more leadership work with middle leaders such as heads of department. The LFHE&apos;s programmes offer the opportunity for individuals to further develop the skills that help to improve their confidence and empathy in the work environment. Such development ensures that institutions are able to achieve their strategies successfully and develop leadership qualities which extend beyond the skills of individual leaders. Resources: Changing conceptions of academic leadership: Implications for practice and development. This LFHE report sheds light on what academic leaders think about leadership. One of the key findings is the importance of appealing to an engaging with the values of academic practitioners. The characteristics, roles and selection of vice-chancellors: In talking to recruitment agencies we learn that experience of collaborative working and partnering abilities are being prioritised in selection processes. Jonathan Ruddle, engagement manager, Maxxim Consulting The funding challenges are going to require very difficult choices: Which courses to drop, which departments to merge, which back office services to share with other HEIs, and so on. It will indeed be lonely at the top but VCs are going to have to make and drive the difficult decisions. My experience of working with senior academics is that the ability to &apos;disagree and commit&apos; is more limited than in the private sector or, indeed, in other parts of the public sector. The research mentality of gathering evidence and making evidence-based judgements comes to the fore, but the reality of strong leadership is that sometimes decisions have to be made without all the facts and evidence one might want to have. Professor Dawn Freshwater, pro-vice-chancellor for staff and organisational effectiveness, University of Leeds We must better explain and demonstrate what leadership in a university actually entails: Leaders in academia can have diverse roles and responsibilities; they not only lead their research field, they lead the colleagues around them, and develop the next-generation of world-leading researchers. The best can combine brilliant research with inspirational student education. But this is not enough on its own. We need leaders who are able to facilitate the constant renewal of his/her the team, the faculty and the organisation as a whole. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

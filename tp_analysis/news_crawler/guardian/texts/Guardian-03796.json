    "text": "One of the immutable laws of the modern games industry states that if a big hit ever emerges in another sector of the pop-culture world, it will be made into a game: any intellectual property that already has a following provide the lowest-risk basis for a video game. That&apos;s why publishers shell out megabucks to license the rights to turn films and sporting competitions into games. But occasionally, something will slip under the radar, capturing the public imagination without having its rights snapped up by the big boys, and Game of Thrones provides the perfect example. Thanks, of course, to HBO&apos;s TV adaptationof the previously obscure books, the fantasy franchise has elbowed its way to the centre of the pop-culture stage. And, sure enough, it is being made into a game  an RPG, naturally  which will arrive for the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC in June. But, strikingly, the Game of Thrones game is being made by a developer which, to put it politely, is unfancied  French outfit Cyanide Studio, previously best known for Blood Bowl, which implausibly married Warhammer and American Football  and published by Focus Home Interactive, which is so low-profile in the UK that its games have to be distributed by the slightly less obscure Koch Media. Keeping it authentic Counterintuitively, Game of Thrones&apos; lack of pedigree could actually work in its favour. Expensively licensed games have a reputation for being hopelessly rushed and generally going through the motions whereas, as Game of Thrones&apos; lead designer Sylvain Sechi explains, Cyanide approached it through the standpoint of being fans of George RR Martin&apos;s books. &quot;We&apos;ve been working on it for more than three years,&quot; he says. &quot;We started before HBO had even signed the rights to do the TV show, so the first part of the production cycle was based on the books. &quot;But once the TV show came out, we worked with HBO to see what we could use from that. And we spent time with George Martin, to make sure everything in the game is current, even with books that will be published later.&quot; Sechi says that while the game takes place in the same time-frame as the first book  and, therefore, HBO&apos;s first TV series. &quot;It was very important for us to create our own original story. Because it&apos;s written in parallel with the TV series and books, it allows us to give players choices with consequences. &quot;George Martin is an older guy, and he&apos;s not really into games, so the story is important for him. He gave us lots of feedback about the story we&apos;ve created for the game, about his characters and even the graphics.&quot; Game of Thrones in the flesh Sechi launches into a fairly comprehensive demo of Game of Thrones after explaining its key features. It&apos;s a single-path, rather than free-roaming, RPG (in other words, more Mass Effect than Skyrim). One unusual aspect of the game, according to Sechi, is that it&apos;s an RPG with two very different and unique characters. &quot;So you&apos;ll start playing as one character, and after the end of the chapter  they general conclude with a TV-style cliffhanger  you&apos;ll start the next chapter playing as the second hero,&quot; he says. The first character, Mors Westford, is a ranger of the Night Watch, who specialises in tracking people and has a dog (which, as Sechi demonstrates in one of the later missions, he can possess and control directly when stealth or the ability to get into small spaces is required). The second character you play is Alester Sarwyck, the heir to Riverspring who mysteriously disappeared 15 years before. He returns (for the funeral of his father) as a sort of fire-priest, with all manner of fire-related abilities; Sechi is keen to emphasise that, because he has been away for 15 years, he has to deal with complex political fall-out.     Game of Thrones    Despite the characters&apos; carefully crafted back-stories, you can choose between three character classes for each, and there&apos;s plenty of scope for character development  there are five main attributes (strength, agility, luck and so on) that you can level up, skill points for different weapons and a complex ability tree. Plus there is a character traits system which forces you to offset strengths against related weaknesses  a sensible-sounding but nevertheless innovative system for an RPG. The character development side of the game  so important for RPG buffs  looks pretty well designed. Game of Thrones has a conversation system which shows your character&apos;s thoughts, rather than what he will actually say. &quot;Each option creates a branch which takes you in a certain direction, and you can&apos;t go back, so it&apos;s not about trying all the options until you get the right one,&quot; Sechi says. He talks up the importance of the choices you make  both in conversation and your actions: &quot;Some choices influence how each chapter plays out  there&apos;s one point of entry to each chapter, but several ways to get to the end, though. And you might find that a choice you make has an impact seven chapters later  for example, people you freed might join you late in the game when you&apos;re assembling a fighting force.&quot; The game&apos;s combat engine appeared to veer towards rewarding a strategic approach, by maximising magical abilities and enhancements, rather than dexterity. One reservation we harbour after the demo is that there seems to be a preponderance of story-setting cut-scenes, although that could have been a by-product of Sechi choosing to show the initial stages of the game. Graphically, it doesn&apos;t look as up-to-the-minute as the likes of Skyrim or Dragon&apos;s Dogma, but it does at least feel like an authentic rendering of Westeros in terms of general ambience. Plenty for Game of Thrones fans The ability to pilot a character through various parts of Westeros will doubtless excite fans of the books and TV series, although they might end up wishing they could indulge in random wanderings around the game-world. However, key locations that do make an appearance include The Wall, the Night&apos;s Watch Castle Black, King&apos;s Landing and Red Keep. Some characters from the HBO series will appear in the game, voiced by the same actors and make to look as similar as possible  most notably Jeor Mormont, Varys and Cersei Lannister. And, in common with any self-respecting RPG, it should provide a pretty meaty experience. Sechi says: &quot;You can play through it, if you&apos;re rushing in 25 hours, but we reckon it will take more like 25 to 40 hours. There are 10 secondary quests, each of which is quite massive.&quot; And, in common with the TV series, there will be some adult content, although toned down sufficiently to attract a 15 certificate. There are, at least, two brothels in the game. While it may not have the most promising of pedigrees, Game of Thrones is clearly being turned into a game for the right reason  a love of George RR Martin&apos;s fantasy world  rather than some sort of marketing-led contractual obligation. And if it turns out to be good, it could massively raise the profiles of Cyanide Studio and Koch Media.",

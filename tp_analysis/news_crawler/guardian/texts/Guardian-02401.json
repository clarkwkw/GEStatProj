    "text": "The iPad 3 launched on Friday. It was all very exciting, with thousands waiting in line outside Apple stores across the world. The new iPad  Apple doesn&apos;t call it the &apos;three&apos;  has an improved screen resolution, processor and camera, as well as a voice dictation tool that the Guardian&apos;s tech editor didn&apos;t think was fit for purpose. As with everything Apple, if you launch it, they will come. In New York hundreds were waiting outside the Soho Apple store before it opened at 8am. By 8.30am, they&apos;d already sold out of black 16gb, AT&amp;T iPads. Hundreds more queued up at the Grand Central and Park Avenue stores. Some came prepared with camping equipment:  ppl are sleeping in their sleeping bags outside the Apple Store on Fifth Ave #ipad  Makia Matz (@unpianistique) March 15, 2012  While others just hung about. Or wove an Apple visit into a night out.  Chris Colasuono came &quot;straight from the bar&quot;, arriving at 5am. He&apos;s after a black 32gb #iPad3 twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/st  Adam Gabbatt (@AdamGabbatt) March 16, 2012  Apple&apos;s store at Grand Central Terminal, one of the company&apos;s largest stores in the world, only opened in December. The new iPad launch was the first big test for the new store, and they hatched an elaborate security plan to try and make sure all hell didn&apos;t break loose. Luckily, all hell did not break loose. Although there was some running.  People are literally running up the stairs at Grand Central Apple Store to claim a new #iPad, as store staffers cheer twitter.com/julpepitone/st  Julianne Pepitone (@julpepitone) March 16, 2012  By 9am, however, things had calmed down significantly, with not an iNerd in sight.  No iNerd&apos;s in front of the Apple store in Grand Central. So either cops aren&apos;t letting people line up, or no one cares about the new iPad.  Xiano NOT Hernandez (@Xiano51) March 16, 2012  Reviews of the new iPad varied. Some thought it was good, others were less excited.  WOW. When you compare the difference in screen res between iPad 2 and new iPad, you will freak.

RT @chrismcgrath5: Some guy waited on line for the iPad 3 and then sold his spot for $900!!!! I&apos;d def wait in line to sell it for that much  923NOW (@923NowFM) March 16, 2012   This girl wants $2,500 for her spot in the iPad line outside the Apple Store on 5th Ave: ow.ly/9GDG5  Will Wei (@WillWei) March 15, 2012   A guy got in line for the new IPAD with no intention of buying it and sold his spot for $500 and all i can think is Y DIDN&apos;T I THINK OF THAT  Daiana Sahadeo (@DaianaSahadeo) March 16, 2012  But of course, not everyone who wanted a new iPad was prepared to wait in one of Apple&apos;s lines. There was much back-slapping this morning among those who managed beat the system.  No line. Bought my new iPad at radio shack in less than 5 minutes.  Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) March 16, 2012   Walked right into Verizon no line for iPad weeeeeee  ptinsley (@ptinsley) March 16, 2012  By mid-morning the queues, and the fanfare, had died down, and the Craigslist posts advertising the new iPad for sale had gone up. Circle complete.",

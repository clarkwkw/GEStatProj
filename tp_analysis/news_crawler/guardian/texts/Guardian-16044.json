    "text": "Google appears to have seized pole position in the race to acquire Israeli navigation startup Waze, with multiple reports suggesting it will pay more than $1bn to beat rivals including Apple and Facebook to the deal. The latest speculation comes from Israel, where business website Globes claimed on Sunday (9 June) that Google will pay $1.3bn for Waze, with news site Ha&apos;aretz following up with its own claim of an all-cash deal worth more than $1bn. In the US, All Things Digital cites its own sources as predicting a Google-Waze deal is close, predicting an announcement on Tuesday (11 June). Facebook and Google were previously reported to be in a bidding war over Waze, after the social network offered $1bn, months after Apple was tipped as a potential acquirer in a $500m deal. Why such a frenzy? Waze&apos;s free navigation app has nearly 50m users, but what the technology giants are fighting over is its data. Waze collects information on traffic, accidents, road hazards and other obstacles in real-time from its community of drivers. Maps and navigation have become a crucial battleground in the smartphone war between Google, Apple, Microsoft and BlackBerry, with Apple in particular under pressure to improve its much-criticised Maps service to better compete with Google. Waze was one of the startups Apple turned to for data in the wake of Maps&apos; underwhelming launch in 2012, so an acquisition by Google may be a double-blow: enhancing Google Maps while potentially removing a valuable source of data for Apple Maps. If the acquisition goes through, Waze&apos;s spurned suitors are likely to turn their attention elsewhere, which may be good news for other companies in the space like TomTom, Skobbler and Navmii. There may yet be further twists and turns in the path towards a lucrative exit for Waze, which has raised $67m of venture-capital funding since 2008. The new leaks in Israeli media may be an attempt to spark new bids by Apple and Facebook, in order to gazump Google in the bidding war.",

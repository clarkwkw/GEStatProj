    "headline": "Science Weekly Extra: Craig Venter on the science of synthetic biology", 
    "text": "Alok Jha meets the celebrated scientist Craig Venter, one of the world&apos;s leading biologists. Dr Venter has made numerous contributions to genomic research and is a pioneer in the emerging field of synthetic biology. In May 2010, he made headlines around the world after creating what he called &quot;the world&apos;s first synthetic life form&quot; by putting together an artificial chromosome and inserting it into a single-celled bacterium. Venter was the keynote speaker at this year&apos;s European Science Open Forum at which he updated a very influential lecture in the history of biology. In 1943, the physicist Erwin Schrdinger gave a series of talks at Trinity College in Dublin entitled &quot;What Is Life?&quot;. These were published a year later as a book and focused on an important question posed by Schrdinger: &quot;How can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?&quot; Schrdinger&apos;s lecture inspired James Watson and Francis Crick in their work unravelling the double-helix structure of DNA, and this discovery in turn kickstarted the field of molecular biology. Venter&apos;s talk was titled &quot;What is Life  a 21st century perspective&quot; and afterwards he spoke to Alok about his lecture and the expanding science of synthetic biology.

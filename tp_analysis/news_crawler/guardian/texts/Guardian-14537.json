    "text": "     One day, veteran game design Shinji Mikami will tire of survival horror and just bring out a match-three puzzler about unicorns. Today is not that day. After teasing us for several weeks, Bethesda has finally announced that it will be publishing the Resident Evil creator&apos;s latest title, The Evil Within  a horror game for PC, PS3, Xbox 360 and next-gen consoles, due out in 2014.  Neither Bethesda, nor Mikami&apos;s studio Tango Gameworks are saying much more, but Gematsu.com has translated the game&apos;s Japanese website:  When Detective Sebastian and his partner rush to the scene of a gruesome mass murder, a mysterious, powerful force is lying in wait for them. Witnessing the killing of fellow police officers one after another, Sebastian is then attacked and loses consciousness. Waking up in a land where monsters are wandering about, Sebastian has to fight his way through a world of death and its close friend madness in order to understand what&apos;s going on. Sebastian has to face his fears in order to survive on a journey to discover what lies in the shadows of that mysterious force.  The text promises a return to the brutal roots of survival horror with limited resources and an environment filled with puzzles and traps. Oh wait, Resident Evil meets Dark Souls? Apparently the world itself warps and transforms in real-time depending on player actions.  IGN has an exclusive &apos;first impressions&apos; article on Monday, and has released a sort of teaser video thing, with sort of movie footage of what the game might be like. I don&apos;t know what the official term is for these things. Concept videos? Live action trailers? Anyway, it seems to be channeling movies such as Ring, The Thing and Hellraiser, which is all good.",

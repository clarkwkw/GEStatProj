    "headline": "Q&A with Naomi Wolf: America's nuclear future", 
    "text": "This week, Naomi wrote about nuclear power, nuclear weapons and nuclear safety, as the Obama administration prepares to go ahead with a new expansion of both a civilian nuclear power program and nuclear weapons-producing facilities.  Is America&apos;s nuclear industry unsafe at any size? How will the US meet emissions targets and move beyond a fossil-fuel energy economy without nuclear power, as some environmental activists have accepted is necessary? Naomi will be joining commenters for her weekly live webchat here in the discussion thread from 1pm till 2pm EST (6-7pm UK time). Commenting will be switched on then, and the thread will remain open afterwards.",

    "text": "China now burns nearly as much coal as the rest of the world combined. The country&apos;s appetite for the carbon-intensive fuel rose by 9% in 2011, to 3.8bn tonnes, meaning it now accounts for 47% of worldwide coal consumption. The growth, revealed by US government figures on Tuesday, was driven by China&apos;s booming economy, which has grown at an average rate of around 10% over the past decade. China overtook the US as the world&apos;s biggest carbon emitter in 2007, and became the world&apos;s biggest consumer of energy in 2010. Research out last November suggested that 1,000 new coal-fired power plants are planned worldwide, with 363 in China and 455 in India. If all the plants were built, it would put the world on &quot;a really dangerous trajectory&quot; for climate change, experts at the World Resources Institute said. China&apos;s air pollution problem, highlighted this month by record-breaking bad air quality in Beijing, is caused by a mix of power plants, factories, cars, construction and farmers burning coal for heat.",

    "headline": "10 Best Windows Phone apps from August 2012", 
    "text": "It&apos;s time for the first of our monthly Windows Phone apps roundups, which will sit alongside the weekly iOS and Android articles as the flow of apps for Microsoft-powered devices increases, this may move to a weekly piece too. Note, games aren&apos;t included in this roundup, because there&apos;s a separate weekly post for all smartphone and tablet games, including the Xbox Live titles that are released for Windows Phone. Read on for the last month&apos;s selection (give or take a few days stretching into July, to mop up some good apps that were released then): Crackle Streaming films service Crackle is now available on Windows Phone in the US, UK, Canada and Australia. It has a catalogue of free movies and TV shows to watch, including Seinfeld, with 20 more being added every month. The streaming works over 3G, 4G or Wi-Fi. The Times British newspaper The Times launched its official Windows Phone app right at the start of August, offering daily editions of The Times and Sunday Times reformatted for smartphones. A 30-day trial is included, but after that point a Times subscription is required. Nokia City Lens Nokia has been releasing a steady stream of exclusive Windows Phone apps as it seeks to differentiate its Lumia handsets. City Lens emerged from beta in August, and is an augmented reality browser that aims to highlight points of interest around you. ESPN Radio &quot;Take your sports wherever your ears go!&quot; promises the chirpy Marketplace listing for ESPN&apos;s radio app. It&apos;s focused on the US so expect more of the other kind of football with live broadcasts of ESPN&apos;s local radio stations and a selection of podcasts available. Heathrow Airport Guide Travelling through London&apos;s Heathrow Airport regularly? There&apos;s a Windows Phone app for that now. Like other flight apps, it offers live flight tracking and notifications, but also terminal maps, and listings for shops and restaurants. Welcome Home This is another app for Lumia handsets, and specifically for people switching from iPhone, Android and BlackBerry smartphones to Nokia&apos;s range of Windows Phones. The idea being it helps transfer across contacts, calendar dates, photos, songs and videos, as well as recommending apps that match the ones on your existing handset. Glamour Conde Nast&apos;s latest magazine-related app is a Windows Phone version of Glamour, promising news, fashion and photos in a quick, easy-to-read format. It&apos;s very much a news app rather than digital issues of the print magazine, though. 627.AM This app describes itself as &quot;an attractive and intuitive daily assistant&quot;. Translation: alarm clock with bells on (not literally). Besides waking you up, it offers a simple weather forecast and note-taking facilities in an elegant Metro-friendly design. Base CRM This isn&apos;t a consumer app: instead it&apos;s for sales teams in companies, to track leads, sales and contacts. Everything synchronises with Base&apos;s web-app, to ensure colleagues are kept up to speed. SplashID This app falls between corporate and personal use: it&apos;s for storing sensitive usernames, passwords, bank account details and other data that you need to remember, but don&apos;t want to store electronically without encrypting it. Again, data can be synchronised this time between SplashID software on computers and other mobile devices. That&apos;s our selection, but what have you been using on your Windows Phone in the last month? Make your recommendations in a comment.",

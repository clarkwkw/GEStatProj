    "text": "Mark Zuckerberg owns 24% of the company he founded as a student at Harvard. His network was credited with sparking the Egyptian revolution and his stake could be worth up to $24bn (15.2bn). Accel Partners, the Palo Alto venture capital firm, snaffled 15% of Facebook when the company was valued at $98m. The deal included million dollar bonus payouts for Zuckerberg and two others. Accel remains joint biggest outside investor with 10%, worth up to $10bn. Yuri Milner&apos;s early investments included a macaroni factory, but this son of a Moscow academic now prefers social media. His fund channels oligarch wealth into Silicon Valley, with stakes in Groupon, Zynga and Twitter. Milner companies control an estimated 10% of Facebook. Dustin Moskovitz had the good fortune to share a room with Zuckerberg at Harvard. He dropped out of his economics course to work for Facebook full time as chief technology officer, leaving in 2008 with a 6% stake, which could be worth $6bn. Eduardo Saverin was one of the three co-founders and a classmate of Zuckerberg&apos;s. Initially granted a 30% stake, he took a commercial role at Facebook but left after falling out with Zuckerberg. His holding, whittled down by funding rounds, now stands at 5%. Sean Parker, the hellraising Napster founder credited with persuading Zuckerberg to hold off selling advertising on Facebook until it had reached critical mass, left in 2005 after a cocaine-related incident. He holds 4%. Peter Thiel became Facebook&apos;s first significant outside investor when he put up $500,000 in 2004. Involved in the web&apos;s hottest properties from PayPal to YouTube and LinkedIn, he remains on the board and holds a 3% stake, now worth up to $3bn. Microsoft invested $240m in 2007, gaining a 1.6% stake, after chief executive Steve Ballmer&apos;s offer to buy Facebook was rebuffed. Now worth up to $1.6bn. U2 frontman Bono found what he was looking for when his Elevation Partners investment group amassed a 1.5% stake in Facebook. It might be worth $1.5bn  which would compensate for less successful gambles on Palm computers and Forbes magazine. Greylock Partners and Meritech Capital Partners hold an estimated 1.5% each, having participated in Facebook&apos;s third round of fundraising.",

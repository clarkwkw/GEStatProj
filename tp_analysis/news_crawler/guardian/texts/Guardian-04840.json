    "text": "   Dr LH Manjunath, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    It&apos;s very easy for cynicism to creep in about Rio. We set development goal after goal and nothing seems to be working out. But the interesting thing is that the heads of states and civil society are generally concerned about these things, and that&apos;s an important part of having the conference in Rio. When we look at the main issues of Rio, they are issues that we want to squarely face. That&apos;s what is giving us hope. But with issues like energy and the environment, at government level they will talk about it, but at grassroots level, poverty is the real issue. Access to education and healthcare, these continue to be the issues. You have to tackle poverty as it adds to emissions, increases population and insecurity. Poverty makes people cut down the forests, so degradation occurs faster. Women in poor families use harmful fuels to cook, which is not good for the environment or their health. Two million women and children are killed a year because of respiratory illness, especially in poorer households. Using cattle dung in a different way to produce biogas for fuel reduces the amount of methane, and this means other harmful things, such as degrading forests, are averted. My country has a large number of cattle. We can have many more biogas plants, which can be used for green energy. My organisation offers affordable micro-loans to people for renewable energy initiatives, such as biogas plants. Our government spends millions subsidising fossil fuels. It must stop all subsidies for fossil fuels and increase subsidies for clean energy. The government makes it so difficult to get subsidies for solar energy in India. Loans by banks are subsidised, but not from microfinance [organisations]. And who do the banks lend to? Rich people. What I expect from Rio is more governments taking decisions, and having the willpower to make them count. I hope something concrete will come out of Rio. We&apos;re almost at the end of the road now. It&apos;s now or never. I don&apos;t think Rio is about targets, but about commitment to act. The millennium development goals created an awareness of issues. Hopefully, Rio will reinforce them.",

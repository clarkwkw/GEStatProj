After looking at the number title of this video, which is intimately related to where he went, if you said Brady had visited Mt Everest, then you are correct! This video shares some numerical facts about Mt Everest -- the tallest mountain in the world -- and shares some information about several other famous mountain peaks in other places in the world, too.             [video link] If you would like to see some photographs from this trip, Brady&apos;s photoessay is viewable here.

    "text": "Q: What is the new iPad called? Is it iPad 3, iPad HD, iPad RD (retina display), or what? A: Just &quot;iPad&quot;. It&apos;s &quot;the new iPad&quot;. It doesn&apos;t have a generational name. Once something gets to a third generation - as here - Apple doesn&apos;t seem to bother with names. Except of course it does with the iPhone. Q: What&apos;s different or new in the physical object? A: A &quot;retina display&quot;, LTE/4G networking capability, a battery with much more capacity (the screen and LTE systems are both power-hungry), a new chip (the &quot;A5X&quot;), 5 megapixel back camera, Bluetooth 4.0, 1080p video recording and stabilisation. Q: What&apos;s happened to the iPad 2? A: That carries on - with a price drop, from 399 to 329 (429 for the 3G model) but only available in the low-end 16GB capacity. Q: What&apos;s new in the software on the iPad? A:  Voice dictation - which is Siri-lite, so the voice-to-text without the action;  face detection in still pictures;  iPhoto, an iOS version of its desktop app, but where you can now manipulate images directly;  some tweaks and improvements to Garageband (&quot;smart strings&quot; - you can be the string section - and multiple recording across more than one iPad);  improvements to iMovie (costing 2.99) which let you cut film footage directly into &quot;trailers&quot; - because, as one of the demonstrators pointed out, these days nobody is going to cut a film of five minutes of shaky camera with Dad on the beach. (Note the image stabilisation too - and expect that in the next iPhone iteration.) Apple also released a software update, iOS 5.1, on Wednesday night, which has various bugfixes and improvements, mainly to the iPhone, though it also lets you delete photos from iCloud&apos;s feed - a much-requested feature. Q: What is the retina display like close up - and what does retina display mean, anyway? A: Even close up, it&apos;s virtually impossible to see individual pixels. The point of the &quot;retina display&quot; is that at arm&apos;s length you absolutely cannot see them, so that you have an effect that&apos;s the same as print: your eye isn&apos;t distracted by the subconscious realisation that you&apos;re seeing something composed of individual lit pixels. This is going to have significant effects on peoples&apos; ability to read text on iPads. Here&apos;s why: the idea of the super-pixel-dense display is something that Jakob Nielsen of Nielsen/Norman Group has been predicting for absolutely ages; getting screens to a pixel density where it can fool the eye should, in theory, mean that you can read as fast there as on paper. (On standard resolution, including the Kindle, you read only about half as fast as on paper.) (Update: that may be an overestimation: this 2001 paper suggests the difference is that reading on paper is &quot;significantly - 10%-30% faster than reading on screen.&quot; There doesn&apos;t seem to be a great deal of research more recently into this topic.) Once a display starts having the same effective resolution as paper, you should be able to read more quickly. There are problems with the fact that the iPad screen uses transmitted rather than reflected light - that will slow down reading a little - but it should be noticeable.  For pictures and other display objects, the improved resolution is - from our limited experience - a bit like the change from standard TV to HDTV. You notice the change as a dramatic leap at first, then get used to it. It&apos;s on going back that you notice what&apos;s missing. Q: Does anyone else have a retina display?A: Asus&apos;s newest Transformer tablet may qualify - judging by the specifications that were announced at Mobile World Congress. But it won&apos;t actually ship until summer, so it&apos;s impossible to know. The new iPad ships on 16 March, which gives it a significant lead. Update: thanks to many in the comments pointing to smartphones with equivalent pixel-per-inch layouts. (Wikipedia page with simple listing.) As is pointed out, many other manufacturers may have equivalent pixel density (around 300ppi) but aren&apos;t marketing them as such. Q: What use is LTE in the UK? A: At present, none at all, because the phone networks are all wrangling amongst themselves about who has the right to which frequencies. Ofcom&apos;s attempts to auction off the spectrum keep running into court challenges, which at least shows that the networks hold 4G (or perhaps its potential revenues) as valuable, but doesn&apos;t get us connected any sooner. Orange/T-Mobile is carrying out some tests in Cornwall and London, but to be honest for most people the LTE networking isn&apos;t going to be any use soon. Also, there are two different models of LTE connectivity, so there&apos;s going to be a risk for people who buy on one network and then think about going to another: particular iPads are set up for particular LTE systems. (This wasn&apos;t a problem for Motorola&apos;s Xoom, because it only offered LTE through Verizon&apos;s network in the US.) Q: What else is new? A: Apple has started moving away from Google in its maps. The iPhoto application uses OpenStreetMap maps, according to ISM&apos;s Jonathan Bennett, who said in a post that &quot;we&apos;re rather pleased to find they&apos;re the latest to switch to OpenStreetMap&quot;. Apple&apos;s growing antipathy towards Google - initially over Android, then in its competition for mobile advertising attention, and then for pretty much everything, suggests that the company may be looking for other providers. But given that maps are a prime method for mobile advertising (Google has certainly begun monetising them), Apple is definitely going to be interested in doing its own mapping. The Maps app on iOS still uses Google - but some people have wondered how long that will last. Q: Where does this leave other tablets? A: Some analysts reckon this will increase Apple&apos;s share of the overall tablet market, even though that is growing. &quot;Apple to seize more than 70% of world tablet PC market in 2012 with new iPad 3&quot; said the (slightly breathless) email from IMS Research - which pointed out that Apple had 62% of the market in 2011 (white box makers 8% - one infers they&apos;re the cheap Chinese Android versions), Samsung 7%, Amazon 7%, Asus 3% and all the rest together taking 13%. But with the new product, IMS Research forecasts that approximately 70m iPads will be shipped in 2012, which would represent a 71% year-on-year growth. Gerry Xu, the company&apos;s PC market analyst, says: &quot;There is a large customer base loyal to Apple products that have been waiting for the latest tablet. Many owners of the iPad 1 are also expected to upgrade to the latest release. In addition to this consumer demand, growth is also forecast as a result of sales into enterprise and education&quot;. The same opinion came from other analysts at the event; the data says that the tablet market presently breaks down to Apple, Samsung, Amazon and lots of also-rans. Gartner&apos;s Carolina Milanesi doesn&apos;t expect Windows 8 tablets to get any traction this year, so Apple has an open goal. No Android tablet comes close to the specifications (quad-core, sure, but retina display? No) or ecosystem (apps, yes, but music and films no, at least in Europe so far), and with the European tablet market having been a rout last year - given no Amazon Kindle Fire, and lots of legal issues for Samsung in Germany, one of the biggest markets in Europe - it&apos;s hard to see that changing. Add to the mix a cheaper iPad 2 which will hit some manufacturers at just the point where they were hoping to get an edge - price - and you can see that Apple replaying its iPod playbook, when it sliced and diced the competition by staying ahead in its ecosystem, and then through pricing, and then product mix. (In which case you might anticipate a smaller &quot;iPad mini&quot; at some point. But don&apos;t get your expectations up. Apple will definitely be happy with its iPad 2 and &quot;new iPad&quot; lineup all this year.) Q: What about Apple TV? A: As Juliette Garside points out, the improvements in Apple TV - 1080p video, a more app-like interface, and even &quot;apps&quot; for things like Netflix content - point towards the company readying itself to do more. Also iCloud has been updated so that any movies that you buy or rent from the iTunes Store will be available across any device you use. (You might as well just watch them on a new iPad - the display would be amazing.)  So the Apple TV that everyone has been buzzing about isn&apos;t here - yet. But analysts, again, are itching with the certainty that something is on the way - noting Tim Cook&apos;s closing words at the presentation that &quot;Across the year you&apos;re going to see a lot more innovation. We are just getting started.&quot; (Then again, that&apos;s a common signoff from Apple executives, and often just means &quot;more computers on the way&quot; or similar.)  Q: What&apos;s the take-away thought, then? A: First: Apple has pulled ahead of rival tablet makers with the retina display. Second, it has cut the pricing legs off those which hoped to sneak under with lower specifications and prices. Third: Apple has begun ever so quietly to cut its ties with Google. Fourth: unless Samsung and others can come up with a tablet with an OLED touchscreen, it&apos;s going to be a torrid year for many unless they can get Windows 8 tablets to a competitive price - but given that the Windows licence is going to cost them around $50 each, it&apos;s hard to see how that will happen. In fact, the happiest company apart from Apple after Wednesday&apos;s announcements is, without a doubt, Amazon: the Kindle Fire and Kindle e-reader remain untouched. Expect them to keep selling well.",

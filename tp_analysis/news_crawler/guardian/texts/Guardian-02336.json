    "text": "    &quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned, the funny thing about five is that it&apos;s not three, four or six.&quot;  ~ Professor John Hunton. Does &quot;Penrose tiling&quot; ring a bell? It should if you&apos;ve been reading this blog for awhile because this phenomenon played a role in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. When the Nobel was awarded, I mentioned that, in my opinion, that body of research was a brilliant combination of chemistry, physics and maths.    In this video, we learn more about the irregular and non-repeating nature of tiling comprised of five-sided figures whose sides are of equal length:             [video link].  Did anyone else catch this last statement: &quot;Science can&apos;t see what it doesn&apos;t have the language to describe.&quot;  Do you agree with that? I ask because I am still thinking about that statement, since that comment ties in with the nature/nurture question, which always causes intensely interesting debates.  You can learn a little more about the interrelationships between language and perceptions.  You can also learn more about the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

    "text": "Next month, world leaders, heads of state, activists and NGOs will head to Brazil for the Rio+20 UN conference on sustainable development. In the runup to the summit, which will be held from 20 to 22 June, we want to hear from you. The summit will be the subject of this month&apos;s Global development podcast. We&apos;ll be looking specifically at whether the event is likely to improve the lives of the poor, so tell us what questions you&apos;d like us to put to our panellists and what issues you&apos;d like covered. We also want to see your messages to Rio+20, which you can post on our Flickr group. If you&apos;re hosting an event at Rio+20, send us some details. And, if you were at the Rio Earth summit in 1992, we&apos;d like to hear your thoughts on whether the aspirations of 20 years ago have been realised. Find out more about how you can get involved on our talk point or on our Rio+20 page. Elsewhere on the site Mark Tran was recently in South Sudan. During his time there he visited a refugee camp and spoke to UK international development minister Stephen O&apos;Brien about Britain&apos;s education programme for the country, and the impact of tensions between South Sudan and Sudan on its plans. Afua Hirsch reported on the roll-out of a new rotavirus vaccine in Ghana. Alex Duval Smith argued that aid to Zimbabwe must take account of resettled farmers on contested land. Meanwhile, Vikki Chambers questioned why regional institutions were unable to avert Mali&apos;s political crisis. Coming up on the site Phoebe Greenwood reports on plans by Israel to transfer Bedouins to purpose-built communities, breaking centuries-old ties with the land. Andrew Wander questions why pictures of starving children still appear to be the key way to motivate donors to give aid. We&apos;ll also report on the Africa Progress Panel report, which is published on Friday. Multimedia Video: Sports manufacturing in Bangladesh: behind the scenes With the Olympic Games approaching, the spotlight has fallen on working conditions at the companies making sports kit for some of the world&apos;s most recognisable athletes. This footage shows a hand-operated production line, from sole to packaged product. In pictures: 21st-century pastoralism in southern Ethiopia Pastoralism in east Africa is being eroded by land-grabbing, environmental degradation and resettlement programmes, but in regions such as Borena in southern Ethiopia pastoralists have adapted to ensure that their way of life can be a defence against hunger. In pictures: Drought crisis in Mauritania Aid agencies say they are facing a major funding shortage to deal with a food crisis in the Sahel, where up to 6 million people are estimated to be in need of emergency assistance. In Mauritania, Oxfam wants to reach at least 70,000 people with food and clean water. However, with a funding gap of more than $1.3m, the NGO will only be able to reach half this number. What you said: some of the best comments from our readers On David Archer&apos;s blog on the importance of quality education, ejanel wrote:  Investment in primary education will offer a low return on investment if adults are not also engaged in developing their literacy skills. Poor literacy among teachers impacts strongly upon the quality of teaching. Poor or no literacy in the home means that children have fewer chances to succeed; this is universally accepted in industrialised nations.  Mark Tran&apos;s piece on a study examining how poor people cope with crisis drew this response from MansoorPractical:  Recently somebody remarked in a very poor area that: &apos;I do not like the word resilience, as it could imply that you expect us to tolerate and adapt more and more without addressing the causes.&apos;  On Melanie Teff&apos;s blogpost proposing a different kind of future for the Dadaab refugee camp, RDickey said:  Economic transition is rough, but maintaining artificial constraints on freedom of movement and business potential will be more costly in the long run. The challenge we face is to not shy away from the challenges of economic transition because they are too frightening. A free, integrated society bears its own costs, but the costs are worthy.  Highlights from the blogosphere On the Panos blog, Kaidia Samak argues that leaders need to consider rural people when it comes to formulating development policy. If you want to get an idea about the current state of development economics, Shanta Devarajan&apos;s African Can  End Poverty blog offers reports from the chief economists of all the regions where the World Bank implements programmes.

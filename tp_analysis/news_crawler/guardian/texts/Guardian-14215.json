The results of the study suggest the MRSA bacteria was transmitted from the livestock to the farmers. The study also raises questions about whether cows could be a reservoir for new strains of MRSA.  A new treatment combining two hormones can reduce appetite, according to research at Imperial College London. The study provides &apos;first in man&apos; evidence that a combined therapy using the hormones glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) may form the basis for a new treatment for obesity and diabetes in the future. &quot;The hormones glucagon and GLP-1 are both used by the body to control blood sugar and metabolism, so there is great interest in utilising them to find new treatments for obesity and type 2 diabetes,&quot; said professor Stephen Bloom from Imperial. Arts and humanities     Photograph: Leo La Valle/EPA     The rise of the Argentine dance, the tango, in Japan stems from the music&apos;s nostalgic sentiments which help the Japanese connect to their own history, researchers at Royal Holloway university say. Lead researcher Yuiko Asaba from the Royal Holloway, said: &quot;The wave of immigrants who arrived in Argentina at the end of the 19th century, whose different cultures contributed to the evolution of tango, had a profound sense of longing for the places they left behind.  Shakespeare was a tax-evading food hoarder, according to a study by Aberystwyth University. Academics from the university have claimed that William Shakespeare evaded tax and illegally stockpiled food during times of shortage so he could sell it at high prices. Social science     Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images     Research by the University of Southampton has found half of those doing voluntary work expressed a negative view of the Government&apos;s Big Society project, with only one in eight in favour of it. Academic Rose Lindsey who was involved in the study, said: &quot;The primary ground on which the Big Society agenda is criticised is that is it a political stunt. Some of these observers argued that the agenda is meaningless and lacking in clarity, or a guise for shifting responsibilities away from government.&quot;  Academics from the University of Manchester have revealed their findings from the most in-depth study to take place in the UK into the tragic instances of child killing by parents, known as filicide. The research found 37% of parents and step-parents who killed their children were suffering from some form of mental illness and 12% had been in contact with mental health services within a year of the offence. And finally     Photograph:  /Getty     Findings of an Open University report into poverty and social exclusion reveal the extent of deprivation and financial difficulties faced by people in the UK. Joanna Mack, learning and teaching producer at the OU, said: &quot;Levels of deprivation today are worse in a number of vital areas  from basic housing to key social activities - than at any point in the past thirty years. These trends are a deeply shocking indictment of 30 years of economic and social policy and reflect a rapid growth in inequality. This has meant that, though the economy has doubled in size during this period, those at the bottom have been increasingly left behind.&quot; Would you like your university&apos;s research featured on the network?

    "text": "The once-unthinkable crossover between Street Fighter and Tekken, the most popular 2D and 3D fighting games in the world, will actually be made twice, though Namco Bandai&apos;s half of the equation, Tekken X Street Fighter, remains without a release date. In the meantime, it&apos;s up to Capcom to work out how best to combine Street Fighter&apos;s quarter-circle and charge motions with Tekken&apos;s directional taps and it&apos;s pulled it off in style. The Capcom cast is a natural fit and the Tekken characters feel so at home they could have been designed by Capcom in the first place. While fighting games have long been perceived as a hardcore pursuit, Capcom is actively courting newcomers as it seeks to expand the genre&apos;s audience. That means simplified control schemes and a gemsystem that helps level the playingfield while also providing plenty of tactical options for advanced players. It&apos;s fast, fluid and an enormousamount of fun. Capcom has set a high standard for Namco to follow.",

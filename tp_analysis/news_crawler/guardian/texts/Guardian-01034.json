    "text": "What youll learnMechanical engineering degrees provide an understanding of core concepts such as thermodynamics, materials science and structural analysis, using tools like computer-aided engineering to analyse problems and find practical solutions. Students will study all, or part, of the life cycle of products, from conception to design to manufacture. Science and maths will be the core ingredients, but you will be required to be innovative and know how to use your creative flair within a legal and ethical framework, as well as learning the importance of managing budgets.   interactive   How youll learnYoull learn through a combination of lectures, tutorials and workshops, as well as practical sessions in the lab or computer workshops. Most courses will encourage you to get hands-on experience by pursuing a project. Through this, youll learn the practical steps of taking your ideas from the drawing board to the real world. Youll learn how to solve problems and overcome obstacles, particularly when it comes to considering the social and ethical difficulties your work could create. Engineering will involve plenty of teamwork, so youll acquire the ability to argue your ideas, analyse those of others and work towards a common goal. Most courses have strong links with industry, so theres a chance that you might work on real-world problems or complete work placements as part of your course. What are the entry requirements?Entry requirements vary. Russell Group universities will require maths and physics. Further maths, design and technology and computing or computer science could also prove useful.   interactive   What job can I get?As with all engineering disciplines, the specialist skills you acquire, as well as a whole host of transferable ones, means you shouldnt have too much of a problem finding work whether its in engineering or beyond. Mechanical engineers are vital to the car industry, the oil and gas and renewable energies industries, IT and finance, music technology and medical engineering. The list could go on.",

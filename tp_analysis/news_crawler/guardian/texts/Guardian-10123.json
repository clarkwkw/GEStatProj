    "text": "The projected cost of safely storing radioactive material at Britain&apos;s largest nuclear site in Sellafield has increased by more than 900m in 10 months, the National Audit Office says in a report released on Wednesday. Plans to replace the ageing nuclear waste facilities in Cumbria have suffered severe delays, auditors said. Twelve out of 14 of the major projects launched last year to build facilities to store material safely are over budget, they have concluded. The findings have been described as &quot;dire&quot; by MPs. It is the first official audit of the Cumbrian site since a consortium of private companies was brought in to oversee safety in 2008. Margaret Hodge, who chairs parliament&apos;s public accounts committee, urged the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to &quot;get a grip&quot; on the spiralling costs. &quot;My concern is that unless the authority holds Sellafield Limited [the company responsible for the site] to a clear and rigorously benchmarked plan, timetables will continue to slip and costs spiral. &quot;It is totally unacceptable to allow today&apos;s poor management to shift the burden and expense of Sellafield to future generations of taxpayers and their families,&quot; she said. In 2008, the authority appointed a consortium of private sector companies  URS, AMEC and Areva  as a parent body of the site to bring in outside expertise. The authority plans to clear up the site over the next 108 years. Progress in 12 of the 14 major buildings and equipment projects considered &quot;critical&quot; for reducing risk, and costing from 21m to 1.3bn, failed to achieve what they were supposed to and had not provided good value for money, auditors said. The consortium&apos;s report found there &quot;is still considerable uncertainty in the schedules and costs&quot; of the projects. A long-term plan to clean up the site, which is managed by Sellafield Limited, was agreed last year after an earlier one stalled because it was &quot;unrealistic&quot;. Sellafield, the UK&apos;s most hazardous nuclear site, stores enough high and intermediate level radioactive waste to fill 27 Olympic-sized swimming pools. For more than 50 years operators failed to plan how to dispose of the radioactive waste and some of the older facilities have &quot;deteriorated so much that their contents pose significant risks to people and the environment&quot;, the report said. The highest risks are posed by ponds and silos built during the 1950s and 1960s to store fuel for early reprocessing operations and radioactive waste, according to the report. About 240 of Sellafield&apos;s 1,400 buildings are nuclear facilities and so far, 55 buildings on the site have been decommissioned. The management of the authority and Sellafield have often been criticised for being a closed group of insiders insufficiently transparent to outside scrutiny. Critics say this has led to a culture where poor decision-making has been tolerated. Next year, a major industry shake-up could occur as the authority will have to make a decision on whether to review or renegotiate the Sellafield safety contract. A spokesman for the authority said that the report has provided a useful external check on their progress. &quot;The NAO has recognised the progress made by the NDA in developing a plan to tackle this hazardous legacy,&quot; he said. A spokesman for Sellafield Ltd said: &quot;We have already taken steps to strengthen our approach, both in terms of how we manage projects as a whole and how we develop better, more beneficial, relationships with the supply chain.&quot;",

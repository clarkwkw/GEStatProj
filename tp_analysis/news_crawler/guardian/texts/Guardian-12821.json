    "text": "Some games excel visually; with others it&apos;s all about how well they play. Unfortunately, Omerta: City of Gangsters struggles to achieve much in either department. A turn-based tactical RPG in the XCOM tradition, it&apos;s difficult from the very outset to understand quite why it has been given a hard-copy release. Bland menus give way to bland city management overviews, which in turn drill down to bland and slightly unwieldy combat missions. At no point does it ever really feel like player agency is affecting events beyond simply allowing them to happen. The inevitable and deeply constrictive rags-to-riches gangland saga is told entirely through text screens telling you what to do, and then offering two or three ways of &quot;doing&quot; it. All of these involve clicking on buildings and assigning hoods to tasks before waiting to be told if you need to shoot people or not. Shoot enough people and it&apos;s on to the next text screen. Crucially, it&apos;s very difficult to feel like Scarface when building a criminal empire is reduced to such bare-bones gameplay. Omerta might have been a neat mobile game, or even an XBLA/PSN/Steam download. For the full price of a game disk, however, this is an offer you can refuse.",

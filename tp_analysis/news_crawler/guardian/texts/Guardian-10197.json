    "text": "When Sheliza Tejani graduated with a business-focused master&apos;s this summer, she hoped the specialist skills she had developed would help her stand out in an increasingly stale and competitive jobs market. Her master&apos;s in management (MiM) from the London Business School (LBS) was specifically chosen with the aim of becoming a consultant. It was part-funded by the Celia Atkin Avent scholarship, which recognises outstanding British businesswomen who demonstrate excellence and achievement. &quot;Having worked for two years with various organisations, including GlaxoSmithKline, Iwanted to make my career transition into consulting,&quot; says Tejani. &quot;I was confident the LBS MiM would give me the competitive edge.&quot; And it worked. Since graduating Tejani has landed her ideal job with the international management consulting firm IMS, which specialises in life sciences. As she says: &quot;My academic and extracurricular achievements and my determination to make a career change were rewarded.&quot; Career acceleration In a tough market, and with top international companies becoming ever-more demanding, many entry-level jobs require specific skills that only a well designed master&apos;s degree can provide. As a result, subjects such as management and accounting have seen a steady growth in student numbers in recent years. According to Higher Education Statistics Agency figures, in the 2010-11 academic year 95,970 postgraduates were studying business-related courses in the UK. &quot;We&apos;ve seen accountancy rise by 36% and finance by 116% over five years,&quot; says Julia Tyler, Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) executive vice president for global market development. According to GMAC, the number of students taking the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) exam to apply for a specialist master&apos;s degree has risen sharply. &quot;More than half of all applicants are women and what people are looking for is career acceleration and professional credibility,&quot; says Tyler. There has also been a big rise in the number of international students applying to take master&apos;s courses at UK and European universities. LBS&apos;s MiM covers business strategy, finance and investment, marketing and organisational behaviour, as well as personal development. According to Fiona Sandford, director of LBS careers services: &quot;We do a 360-degree appraisal with postgrads from day one so that they understand their strengths and weaknesses, and we assign a personal mentor to coach them through career choices.&quot; As interest from students and employers increases, university business schools have been steadily developing specialist master&apos;s degrees. Cass, Manchester and Oxford Sad business schools, and Lancaster University management school, are all highly rated. Cranfield School of Management will be the latest to join the trend when it launches its own master&apos;s in management next year. &quot;Students will benefit from our unique specialist research clubs  groups of companies  which fund our projects,&quot; says Paul Baines, MSc programme director at Cranfield. &quot;Our mantra is: close to business, close to practice.&quot; Strathclyde Business School is adding two specialist MScs in finance from October 2013: the European financial management master&apos;s offered in conjunction with the triple-accredited Skema Business School in Nice and a new MSc in quantitative finance run jointly by the business school and the university&apos;s maths department. According to the head of Strathclyde&apos;s department of finance and accounting, Prof Andrew Marshall: &quot;We&apos;re responsive to employers&apos; needs and in the latter case the industry was asking for people with higher levels of numeracy.&quot; Strathclyde runs one of the UK&apos;s oldest finance master&apos;s degrees, but its MScs in finance and investment, finance and banking and international accounting and finance are less than three years old. &quot;We have about 2,500 applicants for just 137 places on our four programmes,&quot; says Marshall. Strathclyde&apos;s cohort is international and unlike undergraduate degrees, Scottish students must pay the standard tuition fee. This autumn, Warwick Business School (WBS) has added MSc programmes in business and behavioural science, finance and information technology as well as a master&apos;s in business (marketing) to its growing portfolio. There is a big international cohort with many students coming from China, India and Europe. &quot;We&apos;re providing a course that is increasingly popular, with applications rising by 133% over the previous five-year period,&quot; says WBS assistant dean of finance MSc programmes, Alex Stremme. Warwick&apos;s unique selling point is creativity. Finance master&apos;s students have worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company providing business advice and project ideas. &quot;Our dean Mark Taylor has encouraged the concept of looking at things differently. Furthermore, we place an equal emphasis on specialist skills, transferable skills and personal development,&quot; says Stremme. While many students are struggling to come to terms with rising undergraduate tuition fees, the 24,720 cost of LBS&apos;s MiM represents value for money, according to Sandford. &quot;The starting salary of an LBS MiM graduate is typically 10,000 higher than the 25,000 average,&quot; she says. &quot;If a graduate starts with that sort of premium then they will easily pay any extra investment they might make. Top employers are looking for &apos;plug and play&apos; graduates who are ready to slot into a specialised role.&quot;",

    "text": "As commercial comebacks go, it&apos;s not quite up there with Lazarus, but Tiger Woods&apos;s image returning to the cover of the game that bears his name does at least indicate a degree of rehabilitation. While TWPGAT13 slavishly follows the template set down by the first Tiger Woods games more than a decade ago, there are some updates and changes. The swing system, for instance, has been tweaked and if you&apos;re using a control-pad, the changes are helpful. Iffy swings are highlighted and they&apos;re easier to identify thanks to a more logical presentation of both the on-screen swing arc and the thumb-motion on the pad. Kinect control is a less precise affair, as it&apos;s ill-suited to the sort of tiny adjustments required to finesse a swing from &quot;so-so&quot; to &quot;outstanding&quot;. And it&apos;s infuriatingly thick when it comes to interpreting menu-navigation gestures. Which is a pity, because gesture control is the only compelling reason to buy TWPGAT13 if you&apos;ve any of the other Tiger titles from the last five years or so.",

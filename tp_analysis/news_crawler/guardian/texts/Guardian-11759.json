    "text": "Without a word, Activision has removed all of its James Bond games from Xbox Live, Steam and its own website. Rumours about the expiry of its licence may be true, but since the franchise&apos;s most recent game, James Bond 007: Legends was released less than three months ago, many suspect there may be more to it. Good news for buyers of secondhand Wii Us: it transpires that even after erasing the machine&apos;s hard drive, future owners can download any game previously purchased on the console from Nintendo&apos;s online eShop, without paying. Games out this week include Anarchy Reigns (Xbox, PS3), Sega&apos;s cheap and cheerful dose of outrageous cartoon ultra-violence and swearing, and Earth Defence Force (PS Vita), which brings giant robots to Sony&apos;s handheld, and encompasses both ground and air combat, and features four-way co-operative play.",

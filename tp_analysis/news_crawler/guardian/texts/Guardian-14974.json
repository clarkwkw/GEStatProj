The free app, called &quot;Emotion Sense&quot; has just been launched and is available for Android. It takes advantage of the fact that smartphones are increasingly capable of collecting information about where we are, how noisy our environment is, how much we are moving around, and who we communicate with. Dr Neal Lathia, a research associate in the university&apos;s computer laboratory, explained: &quot;Behind the scenes, smartphones are constantly collecting data that can turn them into a key medical and psychological tool. Any smartphone now comes with numerous sensors that can tell you about aspects of your life, like how active you are, or how sociable you have been in the past 24 hours. In the long term, we hope to be able to extract that data so that, for example, it can be used for therapeutic purposes.&quot;  University of Manchester / TorontoFive million asthmatics could benefit from antifungal therapy, researchers suggest. The study published in the journal Medical Mycology, shows that oral antifungal drugs significantly improve symptoms and asthma control in asthmatics with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The researchers also found that antifungal therapy benefits patients with severe asthma sensitised to fungi, called SAFS. Professor David Denning at the University of Manchester said the study results implied that asthma admissions and deaths could be avoided with more extensive use of antifungal therapy. &quot;We were surprised by the number of patients with ABPA, and by the lack of community based studies done,&quot; he said. &quot;Our National Aspergillosis Centre treats hundreds of these patients each year, generally with major improvement, and so a conscious program to seek out ABPA from all asthmatics is required.&quot; Arts and humanities     Photograph: the Guardian      University of WarwickAn entrepreneur has reinvented the umbrella with the help of Warwick Manufacturing Group at the University of Warwick. &apos;The Rainshader&apos; protects people from the elements and crucially doesn&apos;t blow inside out, poke passers-by in the eye or drip on neighbours&apos; shoulders in crowds. Its cut-away front, based on the design of a motor cycle helmet, lets people see the action while allowing the umbrella to sit low over the head so it doesn&apos;t block the view of those behind. It is specifically designed for major sporting events and other big televised gatherings, and is fully customisable in order to offer firms a significant branding opportunity. Dr Xiao Ma, WMG Technology Transfer Specialist, said: &quot;With the Rainshader we applied new and smarter approaches to develop the product, for example allowing for the mass customisation of the umbrella for various customer branding requirements and using additive manufacturing (3D printing) for prototyping purposes.&quot;  Newcastle UniversityThe voices of three generations of Irish men on Tyneside will be brought to life in a play based on a PhD student&apos;s thesis from Newcastle University. The one-man play will be performed by actor Gordon Poad and is based on the testimonies of three members of one South Tyneside family. PhD student Michael Richardson, said: &quot;The play is based on interviews I carried out with three members of the same family and it looks at issues such as ageing and identity. While it is based on their stories, the tale it tells is universal. What is really nice is that it shows the differences in experience between the generations but it also shows the things that still link them together and make their family Irish.&quot; Social science     Photograph: Corbis     University of LeicesterThe way children interpret the conflicts between their parents has different effects on their emotional and behavioural problems, research shows. Children who blamed themselves for the conflicts between their parents were more likely to have behavioural problems, and those who felt fearful that the family would split up were more likely to experience emotional problems, such as depression. The impact of everyday conflict between parents on their children&apos;s behaviour and mental health is driven by how the children understand the problems in the relationship as well as the nature of the conflict itself, the researchers found. These disagreements include: hostile relationships between parents, poor parenting practices, negative parent-child relationships and maternal depression. The research also found that girls may be at higher risk of developing depression when their parent&apos;s relationship is hostile or there is a negative mother-child relationship. Professor Gordon Harold of the University of Leicester said the research highlighted the importance of ensuring that intervention programmes focused on helping parents to resolve these day-to-day conflicts with their partner, while also reiterating the importance of promoting positive parenting strategies.  Birkbeck, University of LondonBabies whose parents are blind have improved attention and memory skills, research finds. The study, which followed the progress of five sighted babies with blind parents, found that while they had near typical face-to-face communication skills with sighted adults, they rapidly learned to use different modes of communication with their blind parents. During the study, infants with blind parents did not show an overall decrease in eye contact or gaze when they looked at sighted adults, nor did they show any autistic-like behaviours. However, they directed their own gaze less frequently and used more vocal communication instead towards their blind mothers. Dr Atsushi Senju said: &quot;This study clearly demonstrate that babies are not passively learning from adults, but carefully watching their reactions and flexibly adjust the way they communicate with the adults. Such a capacity is fundamental to the way humans adapt to the complex social environment and learn cultural knowledge.&quot; And finally     Photograph: Tim Ireland/PA     University of SouthamptonPeople working or travelling on underground railways for sustained periods of time could be at increased risk of health problems because of microscopic dust particles found there. Matt Loxham, PhD student at the university, said: &quot;Typically, ultrafine dust is composed of inert matter that does not pose much of a risk in terms of its chemical composition. However, in the underground station we studied, the ultrafine dust was at least as rich in metals as the larger dust particles. These tiny dust particles have the potential to penetrate the lungs and the body more easily, posing a risk to someone&apos;s health.&quot; He adds: &quot;The high level of mechanical activity in underground railways, and the number of people likely to be exposed, means that more studies into the effects of particulate matter in the underground railway environment are needed, as well as examining how the levels of dust and duration of exposure might translate to effects on health.&quot; Would you like your university&apos;s research featured on the network?

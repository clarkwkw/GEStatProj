QR Codes  Designed to check the simplicity boxes of speed, ubiquity, and small number of steps, QR codes really dropped the ball on cognitive overhead. &quot;So it&apos;s a barcode? No? It&apos;s a website? Ok. But I open websites with my web browser, not my camera. So I take a picture of it? No, I take a picture of it with an app? Which app?&quot; iCloud / PhotoStream  When we heard Steve Jobs preach the utopian future where all of our photos and data would be seamlessly synchronized among all our devices, we smelled the Apple simplicity we&apos;d all grown to love. But in practice, iCloud is rife with cognitive overhead  it only backs up your most recent photos, it works on certain select apps but not others, you have to create an icloud.com email account for it to sync your mail and notes but not everything else. Oh, and it works on new iPhone and iPads and Macs running OS X v10.7.4 or later, but not your PC or Android tablet. Try explaining that to your mother.  There&apos;s quite a long list you could add to that. The &quot;how to do it right&quot; examples are great too. Microsoft multiyear license growth softens pain of PC decline &gt;&gt; Reuters  &quot;Microsoft has successfully transitioned into an enterprise software company and these results show that, because the strength of server and tools and the actual way they sell licenses to business is making up for the missing PC sales,&quot; said Kim Caughey Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. Effectively, Microsoft no longer relies on a new PC to make money from software. Only 20 percent of the company&apos;s product revenue comes from computer makers paying license fees to put Windows on their machines. About 45% comes from multiyear licensing agreements with customers - generally big companies paying millions of dollars for three-year access to Microsoft&apos;s Windows and Office software. The strength of that model is reflected in Microsoft&apos;s total unearned revenue balance - a measure of the strength of its long-term business - which rose 13% from a year earlier and now stands at $17.1 billion.  jQuery 2.0 released &gt;&gt; Official jQuery blog  You asked for it, you got it: jQuery 2.0 has arrived! As promised, this version leaves behind the older Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 browsers. In return it is smaller, faster, and can be used in JavaScript environments where the code needed for old-IE compatibility often causes problems of its own.  Those two browsers still have about a 25% global share, according to StatCounter. (Thanks @vassal for the link.) August 2012: LG sells 5 million LTE devices, 1 million in July alone &gt;&gt; Android Authority August 2012:   The South Korean market is basically split between two companies: Samsung and LG. This has pushed Apple into a tiny market share of around 2% in the region, and forced HTC to get out of the country. Obviously, this is a good thing for Samsung and LG, and it&apos;s one of the reasons why LG has managed to sell so many LTE devices already, even though its impact in the US market is not that great.  Feb 2013: After withdrawing from Japan, BlackBerry is reportedly considering an exit from Korea &gt;&gt; The Next Web February 2013:   Korean news wireYonhap citesanonymous &quot;industry sources&quot; who claim that &quot;sluggish sales&quot; in the country have left BlackBerry executives pondering the future of the company in Korea, where Samsung, LG and Apple dominate the local market.  Can&apos;t find anything subsequent confirming or refuting this. Anyone? July 2012: HTC Leaves the South Korean Market &gt;&gt; TalkAndroid.com July 2012:   HTC, the Taiwanese handset maker, closed down their office in Seoul, South Korea and has completely left the South Korean marketto further focus on the larger markets that they are successful in. With HTC also leaving the Brazilian market not too long ago, it&apos;s clear that HTC realizes what theirstrengthsand weaknesses are.  Motorola to exit South Korean market in 2013 &gt;&gt; All Mobile  As a part of Google&apos;s global reshuffle plan, Motorola Mobility has now announced that it will be closing down almost all of its operations in South Korea in 2013. The move can be seen as a part of company&apos;s global restructuring which has seen close down of most of its international websites including the Indian website less than a month ago. Motorola is not the only manufacturer to exit South Korean market as recently HTC fled from the country. The South Korean market is dominated mainly by players like Samsung, Apple along with LG.  South Korea - a hard game for HTC &gt;&gt; Focus Taiwan Since some were wondering about the size of the South Korean phone market:   The number of smartphone users in South Korea as of August 2012 surpassed 30 million, which equates to roughly six out of every 10 people, according to a study in late August [2012] by SK Telecom and other telecommunications companies.  And increasing by about a million every three months at that time; the upper limit is the 53m total mobile phone population.  For comparison, the US has 133m smartphone users (out of a mobile population of 234m) according to ComScore, and the UK had 36m smartphone users at the end of 2012 and 47m on non-smartphones, according to Portio Research.

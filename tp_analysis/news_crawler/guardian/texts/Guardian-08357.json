    "text": "Britain&apos;s scrutiny of multilateral development institutions has contributed significantly to improved transparency and in achieving value for money in the government&apos;s aid effort, a government watchdog said on Wednesday. A national audit office (NAO) report said the Department for International Development&apos;s (DfID&apos;s) 2011 multilateral aid review, which assessed 43 organisations that accounted for 3.6bn in 2011-12, was valuable in providing accountability to UK taxpayers and in promoting reform in the multilateral organisations themselves. &quot;By conducting a review of the money it spends through multilateral agencies, the department has taken a big step towards improving the value for money it gets from these funds,&quot; said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO. &quot;To maintain this progress, the department needs to collaborate with other donor countries to encourage further consistently measurable performance improvements in multilateral organisations.&quot; The positive findings should provide some political cover for DfID when its budget is under intense scrutiny in such austere times. Justine Greening, a former accountant who took over from Andrew Mitchell as development secretary, has launched an internal review of the department&apos;s spending on technical experts, following media reports that DfID is paying hundreds of millions of pounds to a group of primarily UK-based consultants. The UK aid watchdog, the Independent Commission on Aid Impact, also plans to investigate DfID&apos;s use of contractors. The coalition government has committed to increase international aid to 0.7% of gross national income next year, despite budget cuts, to the displeasure of some Conservatives. The commitment means that DfID&apos;s total spending (estimated at 8.5bn in 2011) is set to increase in real terms by 27% between 2010-11 and 2014-15. On DfID&apos;s multilateral aid review, the NAO said the department had shown international leadership in publicly assessing multilateral organisations, such as the European Development Fund and the International Labour Organisation, against a common set of criteria, and rating their performance. The NAO said the review has influenced some donors&apos; approaches to assessing and reporting on multilateral performance. Australia has used similar methods and the Netherlands has publicly reported its assessments for the first time. But separate donor reviews created administrative burdens and costs for multilateral organisations, the NAO cautioned, so they should be used as a stepping stone to joint assessments. Seventeen of the multilateral institutions told the NAO of the burden of engaging with separate reviews by individual countries. DfID designed its review framework to apply to a broad range of organisations but some found it difficult to review all the evidence requirements, the NAO said. The focus on demonstrable development impacts was important but organisations involved in setting standards found it more difficult to provide the evidence to score well. Moreover, international agreements limit how much DfID can change its funding. The UK contributes to EU development programmes through its treaty obligation to the EU budget, and it must also make a minimum payment as a condition of membership of some UN organisations it rated as &quot;poor&quot; value for money. It is important, therefore, that it has co-ordinated, up-to-date plans on how it will use the review to boost improvements in each organisation, the NAO said. The review rated nine organisations as &quot;very good&quot; value for money for UK aid, 16 as &quot;good&quot;, nine as &quot;adequate&quot; and nine as &quot;poor&quot;. DfID has already announced funding increases to those it rated as offering better value for money and that it will cease to fund four of those it rated as &quot;poor&quot; value for money for UK aid. Funding to those organisations it rated as good or very good will increase from 74% of the total in 2010-11 to 77% in 2014-15. DfID welcomed the NAO report and said it was prepared to take tough action on laggards. &quot;We are determined to get even better value for money and more effective aid from multilateral agencies and we stand ready to take tough action  decreasing or stopping financial commitments  if poorer performers are not making the reforms they need to,&quot; said a DfID spokesperson. But some development experts expressed caution about such a mechanistic approach. &quot;We do not disengage from conflict or failing states,&quot; said Simon Maxwell, an adviser to the parliamentary international development committee. &quot;We should not disengage from institutions like Unido [UN Industrial Development Organisation], but work more closely with them.&quot; Organisations rated as very good value for money for UK aid Asian Development Fund, EU Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, European Development Fund, Gavi Alliance, Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, International Committee of the Red Cross, World Bank&apos;s International Development Association, Private Infrastructure Development Group, Unicef. Organisations rated as poor value for money for UK aid UN Industrial Development Organisation, UN Development Fund for Women, International Organisation for Migration, International Labour Organisation, Food and Agriculture Organisation, UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, UN Human Settlements Programme, Commonwealth Secretariat. Organisations DfID said it would stop giving core funding UN Human Settlements Programme, UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, International Labour Organisation, UN Industrial Development Organisation.",

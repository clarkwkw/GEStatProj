    "text": "More than 700 schools have produced evidence purporting to show that pupils were unfairly treated by examiners who moved the grade boundary for summer&apos;s GCSE English exams. The dossier has been compiled by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) which on Tuesday met the exams regulator Ofqual to submit evidence of complaints by pupils and teachers. These suggested more than 10,000 students who sat tests in January were more likely to get a higher grade for the same marks than those who were assessed this summer. About 950 schools have responded to the association of school heads&apos; call for evidence and 703, about a quarter of secondary schools in the country, claim their results in GCSE English were worse than expected by more than 5%. The growing body of evidence of the impact of the change in marking follows threats by local authorities and academies to sue Ofqual and potentially exam boards for discriminating against pupils assessed in the summer. Headteachers said evidence suggested the downgrades had hit pupils from poor backgrounds and ethnic minorities hardest. &quot;We want to see justice done for those young people who were unfairly marked down on their results mid-year,&quot; said Brian Lightman, general secretary of the ASCL. &quot;This means reissuing grades to all those pupils who were affected because of the change in grade boundaries.&quot; This Friday, Ofqual, the body responsible for moving the grade boundary for the summer exams, is expected to publish an interim report into &quot;the detail of grade C boundary setting for some units in English GCSEs&quot;. Senior Ofqual officials will travel to Yorkshire on Wednesday to meet schools leaders from Bradford and Leeds who are among those who have threatened legal action. The Commons education select committee is also to meet next week to discuss whether to launch an investigation into the issue. Comments by its Conservative chairman, Graham Stuart, dismissing allegations of political interference and supporting Ofqual&apos;s decision to downgrade the June results, suggest any inquiry is likely to have limited scope. &quot;On the face of it it seems a little unfair that the grade boundaries can move,&quot; said Stuart. &quot;But it is possible that they may have been found to be inappropriate and it looks as if the people in January may have been treated more generously than they should have been.&quot; &quot;It is the job of Ofqual to maintain comparable standards over time,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes rather moot the idea of any quiet phone calls by Michael Gove, and the idea of political interference is rather a nonsense.&quot; Stuart said the extent to which the change in grade boundary disproportionately affected students from poorer and ethnic minority backgrounds would be worthy of investigation. &quot;I hope Ofqual will be able to give us some understanding of that [in their interim report].&quot; In a letter to the National Association of Head Teachers, Glenys Stacey, the chief regulator at Ofqual wrote: &quot;Modular GCSE English presented particular difficulties this summer, we know. It is a high-profile, large-entry, and of course a very important qualification. &quot;This year, there were significant changes, including the introduction of an English GCSE alongside new English Language and English Literature GCSEs. There was also an increase in the numbers of students taking other qualifications such as iGCSEs, and there were changes in entry patterns, which all means that the cohorts were not comparable from year to year. Setting standards when things change in this way is not always trouble free.&quot;",

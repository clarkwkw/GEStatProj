    "text": "Like the Oxford Dictionaries&apos; word of the year (2012: omnishambles), Google&apos;s annual Zeitgeist list of the year&apos;s top UK internet search terms is becoming a handy barometer of what is on the nation&apos;s mind. In 2012 the top UK search terms included Whitney Houston, Kate Middleton, Gangnam Style and April Jones, the Welsh five-year-old who went missing in October. Zeitgeist measures the year&apos;s fastest-growing search terms, rather than the largest volume of searches. The top 10 overall list of trending terms features familiar online preoccupations  sport, celebrity, the royal family, viral videos, Apple product launches  along with others relating to big stories of 2012, including NatWest Online, which went down in July leaving customers with no access to their internet accounts and unable to use debit cards, and the disappearance of April Jones, who remains missing despite a massive search effort. Sport is represented by Euro 2012, the fastest growing Google UK search term of the year, ahead of Olympic tickets (possibly because these went on sale in 2011). Houston, the US singer who died in February, is at No3, followed by the Duchess of Cambridge. Also in the top 10 list are Netflix, the US video-on-demand service launched in the UK in early 2012; iPad 3; Gary Barlow; and South Korean pop star Psy&apos;s song Gangnam Style, the video for which has become YouTube&apos;s biggest ever hit, approaching 1bn views four months after going online. The top 10 trending politician was Conservative minister Jeremy Hunt, who as culture secretary survived a grilling at the Leveson inquiry over his relationship with News Corporation, before inheriting the controversial NHS reform brief. Tories dominate the political list  Boris Johnson, Justine Greening, Michael Gove, George Osborne, Louise Mensch and Nadine Dorries also feature. Andy Murray, Tom Daley and Jessica Ennis were the top three on the British Olympians list, with Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps and Roger Federer heading the list of foreign Olympians. The fastest-growing sports-related searches were dominated by Olympic events, with synchronised swimming, murderball (officially known as wheelchair rugby), wheelchair basketball, volleyball and archery all ahead of the 100m sprint. Rio de Janeiro, which is hosting the 2016 Games, was the top travel destination search term. Bond film Skyfall and Gangnam Style topped the movie and song top 10s but other Zeitgeist lists produced some surprises. BBC children&apos;s show Mike the Knight was top of the TV shows and Lucy Spraggan, an X Factor contestant who fell ill and quit in November, topped the music artists category. Dr Grant Blank of the Oxford Internet Institute said the Google Zeitgeist results reflected popular concerns and highlighted the perennial question of whether popular culture is really important. &quot;To many people it is, though it&apos;s outside institutional society, politics and foreign affairs,&quot; he said. &quot;Popular culture is a way for people to be connected to larger society, to something bigger than they are, and it&apos;s easier to connect to a person than to something more abstract.&quot; Blank pointed out that Google&apos;s search trends can only reflect the UK&apos;s online population, with as much as 25% of the country  likely to be poorer, older and less educated  not yet online.Another unspoken constituency omitted from Google&apos;s trend reports is the adult content market. Metrics firm comScore declined to provide statistics on adult content, although a 2010 figure from researchers at Nielsen estimated that as much as 27% of UK web traffic was porn related. &quot;Searches for adult keywords are pretty constant, and although unquestionably popular, we don&apos;t think they define the Zeitgeist for any one year,&quot; said a Google spokesperson, though the company would not release trending data on adult content. &quot;We apply the same kinds of filters to the Zeitgeist that we use for SafeSearch, so no adult keywords are included.&quot;Google retains a near monopoly on UK search engine traffic with, according to comScore, a 90.2% share of the market. It faces a challenge as consumers come to rely more heavily on their mobile devices for internet services, changing the nature of how and what people search, and because information stored in mobile apps cannot be indexed by the search engine. Google would not break out what proportion of its traffic is mobile, but said the volume of combined searches had nearly doubled year on year.Blank is confident that Google will continue to dominate as the most intimate relationship we have with technology. &quot;There are people who feel that the coming wave of machines are going to be making decisions for people in a way they don&apos;t understand, though I think that&apos;s a little overstated,&quot; he said. &quot;But power stations are now automated to some extent, and we&apos;re looking at automated landing systems for airplanes and cars that don&apos;t need drivers. There is research into how these things might fail, but they will be easier and safer because the machine makes decisions faster and without distraction. Where the balance lies is yet to be determined.&quot;",

    "text": "This week&apos;s alien invasion comes courtesy of the Lutadores, a barbaric horde with advanced weaponry and gravity-warping technology seemingly beyond their own control. Playing as generic hero-cop Davis Russel and his partner Leo Delgado, you&apos;ll battle your way from being prisoners of war to freedom fighters, turning the Lutadores&apos; own arsenal against them. Inversion&apos;s main trick is to turn gravity on its head: the &quot;Gravlink&quot; weapon creates pockets of higher or lower gravity. While credit is due to Namco for at least trying to create something new for the somewhat worn cover-based third-person shooter genre, its implementation leaves a lot to be desired. Floating enemies bob in the air, awkward to shoot, while using de-gravitised chunks of rock as missiles is so inaccurate as to be mostly useless. Instead, you will fall back on old habits, diving for cover and taking turns with enemies to shoot at each other. Later sections, where the player is placed on a different axis to the alien threat, show off more of the game&apos;s potential, but the distant and indistinct enemies make it frustrating rather than exciting. Unfortunately, that Inversion&apos;s few innovations are so easy to ignore  and outright desirably so in places  makes its otherwise generic nature all the more disappointing.",

    "text": "Ragnarok Odyssey is part of the biggest cross-media franchise you have (probably) never heard of. Originating in Korea as a comic book series and then transplanted to Japan in animated form, this hack-and-slash role-playing game is just the latest outing in the series. Thankfully, however, no prior knowledge is required. After crafting your personal avatar from a sizable number of customisation options, you are dropped into the game world as a newly recruited mercenary. The story is mostly typical fantasy-style bobbins, though by planting its roots in Norse mythology, Ragnarok does feel at least slightly more original than its peers. While the monster-slaying, resource-gathering gameplay lends itself to comparison to Capcom&apos;s Monster Hunter, the brevity of its quests and rapid sense of growth and character empowerment make it a top choice for portable play, while local and online multiplayer options add depth.",

    "text": "US food aid is big business. Last year, over 40 companies sold the US government 1.8m tonnes and nearly $1bn worth of food for use in its overseas &quot;in-kind&quot; food assistance programmes. They dealt in dozens of different commodities  from major grains such as wheat and sorghum to specialised food aid products such as corn-soy blend. US food aid was shipped to at least 48 countries. The Guardian compiled details of 822 food aid contracts awarded by the US department of agriculture (USDA) in the last fiscal year (1 October 201030 September 2011) as part of an investigation into how the American government buys the food for its controversial in-kind food aid programmes. Sources USDA publishes details of each food aid contract it awards. But it does so in ways that are difficult for the public to access and analyse. Contract awards for packaged goods (such as containers of vegetable oil) and bulk shipments are published in different formats, for example. And the use of special codes for commodity types, ports, aid agencies and NGOs make it harder to decipher records. Halfway through the last fiscal year the USDA changed how it published procurement records, shifting in April 2011 to a new website and from text files (which are easier to analyse) to pdfs (which save letters and numbers as images, making it harder to pull the data out and into a database). To gather information on which companies sold which commodities to the US government for food aid last year, we went through contracts for:  Packaged goods (such as containers of vegetable oil) awarded before April 2011  Packaged goods awarded after April 2011, in the &quot;FSA-Intl Packaged&quot; folder  Bulk shipments (such as 10,000 tonnes of wheat) awarded before April 2011  Bulk shipments awarded after April 2011, in the &quot;FSA-Intl Bulk&quot; folder We also wanted to know where the food aid ended up. Only records for bulk contracts contain information on where the food purchased goes. To get destination details for packaged products we had to match contract awards to shipping records (published as spreadsheet downloads). Process Contract awards published as text files were extracted programmatically using ScraperWiki, a tool to gather information from the web and store it in a database. Data from pdfs was manually entered into a spreadsheet. These were both pulled into a database for analysis. Each contract is given a unique ID. These appear either in their corresponding &quot;cargo availability reports&quot; or in their filenames. We used this to match contract and shipping records, and get details on the destinations for packaged food aid products. But many contracts entail the purchase of multiple commodities, and these are often split into several shipments and headed for different destinations. Tracing these purchases is no trivial task. To ensure exact matching of contracts and cargo reports, these records were joined using contract IDs, quantities and ports. An example is shown below. Step-by-step        3. Example of a PCA issued after April 2011 In a few cases, a contract award for the same company contained multiple orders for the same quantity and type of food, but for slightly different prices. When the corresponding cargo report showed two destinations for these purchases, we could not confidently say which country received the food at which price. In these cases we used the lowest price and assigned it to both countries. For some contracts no corresponding cargo reports were uploaded. This means for 80 records we have no destination details (accounting for 4% of the total tonnage for the year). Despite the challenges, our totals for fiscal year 2010-11 are under the USDA&apos;s reported figures by only 0.3%. For those who want to replicate this process, a more detailed and technical look into how the data was compiled is also available. Next steps Forty-six unique commodity types are listed on these purchase awards, including nine types of beans. For this investigation we put these types into 17 larger groups. Yellow split peas, for example, are included in our broader &quot;peas&quot; category. We also researched each vendor and grouped subsidiaries along with their parent companies for our analysis. Contract awards for 2010-11, and for previous years, are available on ScraperWiki. Unfortunately, it seems subsequent years&apos; data will be locked in pdf files. There is a wealth of detail here, and we are keen to see what you do with the data. Download the full spreadsheet and let us know what you find.",

    "text": "Early reports from reviewers who&apos;ve played the final code say it&apos;s one of the games of the year  and you can find out all about it at the Guardian office on Wednesday night. Dishonored, from French developer Arkane Studios, takes players into a dark steam punk city, where a deadly plague rages and a treacherous aristocrat runs a nightmarish police state.  To celebrate the launch of the game later this month, Guardian Extra has teamed up with publisher Bethesda to host an event at our offices in Kings Place. Art director Sebastien Mitton and visual design director Viktor Antonov will talk about how they imagined and built the city Dunwall and its unique retro futuristic architecture. This is an amazing opportunity to discover how some of the most talented artists in the industry work. Mitton and Antonov will explain the creation of the game, before discussing its inception with me, followed by an audience Q&amp;A and a chance to browse a gallery of concept art. There are be the chance to win an exclusive piece of art designed just for the night. There are still some tickets available, at 8 each. Please go straight here to secure your place!",

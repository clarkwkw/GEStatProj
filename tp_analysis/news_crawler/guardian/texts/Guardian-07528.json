    "text": "Nasa&apos;s rover Curiosity has returned the first colour panorama of its landing site inside 155km-wide Gale Crater on Mars. The late-afternoon view reveals a gently-undulating plain surrounded by the hills that form the crater&apos;s walls. Dark grey dunes cross the plain between the rover and 5.5km-tall Mount Sharp at the crater&apos;s centre. The small rocks surrounding the rover should pose no problem to the vehicle&apos;s 75cm-wide wheels, according to Nasa. The rover landed on Monday to the elation of the mission&apos;s operations team at Nasa&apos;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The images taken so far include the first views from the ground of Curiosity&apos;s ultimate target: a region in the foothills of Mount Sharp. Scientists have started planning the route from the landing site to this spot, through a gap in the field of dunes. Science team member Dawn Sumner of the University of California, Davis, said that the target region of &quot;beautiful knolls of layered rocks&quot;  the main reason for choosing Gale Crater as the landing site  is expected to have recorded the crater&apos;s geological history. Curiosity&apos;s science instruments have successfully undergone initial tests, and the camera mast  essential for the use of the navigation and science cameras  has been raised as planned. The operations team were surprised by the presence of gravel on top of the rover, which they believe was thrown up during the landing. As these small rocks did not land on any instruments, they are not expected to be a problem. Up to a thousand commands are sent to the rover every day, and new software will be installed on Curiosity prior to it turning its wheels for the first time. Scientists regard the initial data as only a taster of what it to follow, and are excited by the prospect of receiving higher resolution images soon. Pictures and other data are currently sent to Earth relatively slowly via other spacecraft orbiting Mars. Rover team members anticipate streaming data back to Earth in about a week&apos;s time at broadband speeds of 2Mbps. Curiosity landed after an eight-month cruise from Earth. Initially slowed by parachute, a complex, rocket-powered descent stage then winched the rover to the surface. The rover&apos;s landing site is now surrounded by greyish blast marks from its descent rockets, which scientists are keen to probe using its ChemCam laser system.

    "text": "Literacy has become a hot issue in the UK and internationally, with growing outrage that many children fail to learn to read and write. Globally, there are about 50 million more children in school today than there were just over a decade ago. There are still challenges in achieving universal access  more than 67 million children are still denied this basic right  but it is important we now also focus on ensuring that children in school actually learn. It is a violation of children&apos;s rights if they are in school year after year yet fail to develop basic skills. However, a reductive focus on literacy and learning outcomes can lead us into at least four fundamental mistakes. One serious mistake is investing disproportionate resources in comparative assessment. There is pressure on ministries of education across Africa, Asia and Latin American to better assess the reading progress of children in the first two or three grades of school  and, increasingly, to do so in ways that allow international comparison of performance. This generates lots of work for international examination boards, publishers and consultancy firms, but risks giving primacy to international data collection rather than the provision of practical support for teachers in the classroom, who are often working in very different contexts. Teachers should be able to monitor the progress of children, but need to be able to do so in ways that are contextually relevant. A second mistake is to look for and promote &quot;magic bullets&quot;, or simplistic technical solutions, that adopt a one-dimensional approach to teaching literacy. For example, in the UK, synthetic phonics is presented by some people as if it is the only effective way to teach. Yet I have seen children and adults in different contexts learn to read and write effectively in many different ways, using different methods. My own advice is always to draw on as wide a range of approaches as possible. Teachers need to know how to work with phonics and decoding, but also need to focus on the meaning and purpose of diverse texts from the very start. Children need to see the value and purpose of reading, to be excited and motivated by learning. The macro-, meso- and micro-dimensions of learning literacy need to be interwoven, and teachers need to be trained  and given the space to use  a range of tactics. A third mistake is to claim that a focus on learning outcomes means &quot;inputs&quot; are not important any more. When I pointed out to World Bank officials that many children in rural Africa are taught in classes of 100, with untrained or undertrained teachers and few textbooks or visual stimuli, I was told I should stop dwelling on the old &quot;input model&quot;. I reject that. Nothing is more important to learning than a well-trained teacher, working in a manageable class size, with basic teaching-learning resources available. Our focus on outcomes should be a reminder of the fundamental importance of these basic inputs  and we cannot feign surprise if children in overcrowded and under-resourced classrooms fail to learn. We need to put in place the basics first. A fourth mistake is to think schools will do everything alone. The biggest determinant of success in any school is the home environment. When children come from homes where both parents are illiterate, and there is nothing to read or reinforce their learning, they are likely to fail. If the school is an oasis of literacy in a village community, it is hard for children to develop literate habits or to value literacy practices. Officially, there are more than 750 million illiterate adults in the world; in reality, that number should be doubled. Yet almost nowhere are governments investing in adult literacy programmes. There is compelling evidence on the particular importance of female literacy for transforming the chances of girls, and there is clear evidence about what works in running effective adult literacy programmes. A set of 12 core international benchmarks developed by ActionAid and the Global Campaign for Education have been widely agreed. Until we see new energy being invested in female literacy, we cannot be surprised that children struggle to learn. Children  and adults  have a right to quality learning. This is embedded in international human rights conventions and is one of 10 core education rights promoted by ActionAid. Others include the right to: a safe and non-violent environment; a quality teacher; relevant education; and transparent, accountable schools. As we rightly focus on improving learning outcomes, let&apos;s avoid the fundamental mistakes above and work towards holistic, rights-based approaches to literacy.

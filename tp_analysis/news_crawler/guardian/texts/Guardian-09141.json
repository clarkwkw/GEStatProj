    "text": "This summer&apos;s washout, interposed by spells of neon blue sky, has changed to days of Skiddaw-slate skies above lakes, tarns and reservoirs that are brimful. Thirlmere  just one example  is awash. How the winds have yowled, refusing to be blaan oot (Cumbrian dialect for blowing out a candle), but still scouring the Lake District and blaa&apos;in&apos; oot even ravens from the sky. Taking their place, arms outstretched as if sky diving, walkers who braved the heights have then descended by leaning out horizontally into the gale holding them aloft. Westerlies and sou&apos;westerlies have blown unending. Wild Ennerdale  a partnership between local people and organisations led by the National Trust, Forestry Commission and United Utilities  really has looked untamed as westerlies have raced through Jordan Gap between Pillar Rock and Pillar and, on the far side of the mountain, Wind Gap (flanked also by Black Crag). And on they have gusted: over Looking Stead, across Beck Head col to circumnavigate Kirk Fell, and then to tear through Windy Gap (sandwiched between Green and Great Gable) and down Aaron Slack to churn up Sty Head Tarn with white horses at 1,434ft and on over Seathwaite Fell. High House Tarn was next as the westerlies continued streaming towards Langstrath, the wilds of Raise and on over Calf Crag and Steel Fell to cross Dollywaggon Pike and beyond. Skyline tarns have looked in danger of emptying, their contents spouting into the air, including the water of Burnmoor Tarn, Lakeland&apos;s third largest, its spray sometimes reaching the shore and drenching adventurous walkers. One tarn is reputedly so placed, a hurricane could whip up a freak wave that would send thousands of gallons of water spilling over its dam  though legend has it that that could only happen once in a blue moon. As it was, it was out of the firing line of recent winds.",

    "text": "Having lived through revolutions in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, I should have known that revolutions are notoriously hard to predict. There is a messy chaos between the hope, euphoria and promise, and the stark reality of what comes after toppling a hated regime and before building a new future. What I saw on my week-long trip in Egypt in April was a revolution in need of intensive care. The place was full of &quot;noise&quot;. The distraction around processes and procedures (disbanding the constitutional committee, disqualification of candidates for the presidential election on 23 May) combined with the personalisation of politics (the debate is about who the presidential candidates will be rather than what they stand for) means that there is worryingly little discussion of issues of substance. What democracy or the constitution mean for Egypt; the platforms of the parties or candidates; what kind of country Egypt should become, and how it should manage its serious challenges in the foreign policy, economic and social spheres  none of this is being discussed enough. There is still a palpable sense of hope, enthusiasm, and a mushrooming of association and self-organisation, but no real sense of a vision for the endgame. The discourse is dominated by a social conservative agenda; Islamic ideologies seem to have become a force shaping this new history, using democracy as a pretext for introducing the &quot;diktat of the majority&quot; to restrict personal freedoms. Whether this agenda spills over into public life will be determined by who wins the religious state versus civil state argument. All policies in Egypt seem to be under scrutiny with a risk of throwing the baby out with the bath water  women&apos;s rights seem to be the ones thrown out first. There are only eight women MPs in the parliament. Tellingly, the Freedom and Justice party has fielded a socially conservative woman as MP, who has come out publicly against women&apos;s freedoms. There is also a perception that policies imposed by Suzanne Mubarak have given women more rights than they &quot;deserve&quot;, and the hardliner Salafist discourse under the disguise of Islam has triggered increased encroachments on women&apos;s rights  one example is the re-emergence of voices in support of female genital mutilation  a practice that is banned in Egypt. In Ben Saef region, some women told me that families have been paid money with strings attached  keep your women at home and under control. There seems to be opposition to these new trends from religious minorities, liberals and a wide-ranging set of actors that consider themselves religious yet reject attacks on women&apos;s rights, but they are not yet organised enough to speak with one voice. I visited a partner organisation that has found innovative ways to involve Al-Azhar University scholars in promoting a moderate and progressive interpretation of Islam to preachers  the partner started with where the scholars were in terms of their understanding and worked with them to develop a moderate message on women&apos;s rights. We need to support and amplify these kinds of efforts. There are amazing civil society organisations in Egypt  diverse, brave, determined. Over the years, many of them have used the funds and support of international actors, including Oxfam, in their work for human rights, fighting poverty and injustice, and to raise their voices against repression. In a place such as Egypt, at a time full of vibrant self-organisation and civic activism, civil society at least deserves to have a proper law on freedom of association and a space to act. Unfortunately, even after the revolution, they have neither  the restrictions against civil society, and the smear campaign against international NGOs and foreign funding of national NGOs, have created an atmosphere of fear. Some national NGOs now try to keep their distance from western donors and NGOs, fearing accusations of promoting &quot;sinister&quot; foreign agendas  something that is fast becoming a favourite trick across diverse dictatorships in different parts of the world. The national and international civil society community are attempting to organise and fight for an alternative law on freedom of association and an alternative narrative to counter the smear campaign. The revolution in Egypt continues; it is far from over and may unfold in unpredictable ways. At the moment it is in need of intensive care to live through this dangerous, and yet immensely exciting, phase and fulfil its promise. We all want to be there with the people of Egypt, helping them to make it happen.

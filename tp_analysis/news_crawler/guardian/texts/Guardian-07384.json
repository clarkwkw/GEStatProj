    "headline": "An introduction to me", 
    "text": "Despite having a few articles up on here already, as one of the new additions to the ranks of the Guardian&apos;s science bloggers, it seemed appropriate to introduce myself more fully. A quick potted history of my research and outreach activities seems sensible, though as might have already been gathered I&apos;m a palaeontologist specialising in the non-avian dinosaurs and their close relatives the pterosaurs. I&apos;ve always been keen on animals for as long as I can remember and spent many a long hour dragging my parents around zoos and museums just desperate to see animals of all shapes and sizes. I was determined to be a biologist of some description and was intent on making a career of studying animals. While dinosaurs were always part of this, they were never really a huge draw for me, or at least no more than any other group, and I rather fell into them by chance.  As such I started off my academic career reading zoology where I rather specialised in animal behaviour and locomotion. This was followed by a masters based at the Natural History Museum in London and where I ended up writing about the evolution of dinosaur size for my thesis. That in turn led me to have the opportunity to pursue a palaeontologically based PhD looking at the origins of the pterosaurs and that was pretty much it: I was a palaeontologist. Following my doctorate in 2005 I spent two years working in Munich and then onto Beijing for a further three years before taking up a short lecturing post in Dublin. Starting in Munich I was able to get to grips with the aspects of palaeontology I&apos;m most interested and involved in  the ecology and behaviour of the dinosaurs.  However, like most researchers I&apos;ve covered quite a range of topics in my research (as you can see here) with bits of work on dinosaur teeth, pterosaur wing membranes, fossil footprints, the preservation of fossil feathers and more, and I&apos;ve also been responsible for naming a number of new dinosaur species. Most recently though, I&apos;ve been able to develop my work on the socio-sexual behaviour of dinosaurs and on the predatory behaviour of the theropods and have published a series of papers exploring these issues and with some more in the pipeline. From a young age I&apos;ve been actively involved in various outreach projects and science communication efforts and this blog is simply the latest in quite a line for me. Aside from a variety of talks, presentations and magazine articles I&apos;ve started up a number of online projects. The forerunner to this was my blog Archosaur Musings which is rather more technical than Lost Worlds is intended to be. Musings is still ticking over in the background and there&apos;s nearly five years&apos; worth of material on there for those who want more detail on their dinosaurs. I managed a post a day for much of that time and naturally ended up covering a great deal of material, and some of the most important and interesting pieces I hope to update and recapitulate here on occasion.  With a number of colleagues I set up Pterosaur.net as an online resource on pterosaurs, as they seem to suffer particularly from being confused with both dinosaurs and birds, and there is an occasional accompanying blog for the site too. Finally, my big outreach project is Ask A Biologist. Set up about five years ago now, this is there to provide direct access to scientists and try to break down the perceived barriers between researchers and the public. Anyone can leave any question about biology and have it answered (well, hopefully) by one of a panel of academics and researchers with a very wide-ranging set of specialisations. To date we&apos;ve answered more than 6,000 questions (all of which are archived on the site) and have, I hope, really helped educate and inform people with even the most casual interest in biology.  Oh yes, and I&apos;m on Twitter too. That&apos;s it really. I do a lot of dinosaurs, a fair bit of pterosaurs and I&apos;m especially interested in the ecology and behaviour of these extinct reptiles. As a result, you can expect a fair bit of that on here in the coming weeks and months, but I also intend to write a fair bit about new discoveries and changing ideas about dinosaurs and indeed other fossil finds too with a liberal dose of science communication, evolution and the like.  If you want to know a bit more, well you can explore those sites and I&apos;ve done a couple of interviews over the years (here and here) about my work that may be of interest.",

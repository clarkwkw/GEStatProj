    "text": "Tiger, tiger, burning bright... Like the creature of William Blake&apos;s vision, this one appeared with thrilling suddenness and a &quot;fearful symmetry&quot;. The tiger beetle paused on the warm bare stones of a bank beside the path that ran along the top of Lea quarry. The space around the beetle seemed to pause too. The sun wasbright and the high ledge above therock face hummed a rare sunny warmth. Down in the woods around the old lime kilns, birds flitted through an emergent green, shadows beginning to flower with bluebell and wild garlic. Trees above the understorey had yet to leaf but were loaded with purple polyps of ash flower. There was still a fag-end-of-winter feeling in the dank heavy-with-the-weight-of-history atmosphere around the kilns. Up on top of the Edge was very different. Blue sky soared far above the great blown-open void of the quarry and had a swallow in it  it may not make a summer but it certainly made a start. Sunlight flooded in from beyond the Clee Hills and filled up the hole. The stony bank along the path, caused decades ago by a landslip, was dizzy with not-so-solitary bees, bumblebees and hoverflies. Patches of short grass had yellow cowslip, pink storksbill, purple violet. A patch of white wood anemone and a cache of last year&apos;s hazelnuts beautifully holed by dormice were reminders of the woodland the quarry had bitten into, now ringing with chiffchaff. Into this scene of spring joy sprang the tiger. Legs of red glass, glowing eyes, jaws like daggers, its body was the most wonderful green: iridescent metal with heraldic markings in white, an essential green, like the spark that set spring alight. The beetle accelerated, fast-forward in time, to run while we were frozen still. It flickered, stopped, then flew into the sun.",

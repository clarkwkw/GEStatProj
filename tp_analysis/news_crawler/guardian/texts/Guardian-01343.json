    "text": "Entropy always increases, and this is the most obvious way of telling which way time is running. It&apos;s known as the second law of thermodynamics. It&apos;s fascinating, to the extent that the discussion about a cup of tea at the end of this blog about black holes and fuzzballs was at least as interesting as the seminar which inspired the article in the first place.  If you share my fascination, I recommend this video on time and entropy, which I was pointed to on twitter by Sean Carroll.            As they say in the film, electromagnetism and gravity are symmetric under a change of time direction - they work just the same backwards and forwards. The film doesn&apos;t mention it, but there are some weird corners of physics that are not symmetric under change of time direction. The weak nuclear force breaks this symmetry. This is connected with why there is more matter than antimatter around, and is something LHCb is studying at CERN, for example. But it doesn&apos;t seem to be connected with the &quot;arrow of time&quot; we get from entropy, at least as far as we know. I&apos;m reading &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; by Philip K Dick right now. The most memorable image I have of entropy comes from his book &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; (from which Bladerunner was made), where he uses the term &quot;kipple&quot; to describe the junk which tends to overwhelm us unless we fight it. The run-down city-scapes, filmed so well in Bladerunner, are full of it. So are most of the drawers in my house. It&apos;s not my fault, it&apos;s physics.",

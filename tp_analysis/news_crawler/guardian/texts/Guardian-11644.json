    "text": "A wet day again, but rather than yet another in the succession of drab days with rain falling unceasingly from a low and featureless grey sky, today&apos;s wind-driven weather is full of life and drama. The latest shower slams in from across the sea, an amorphous leaden cloud turning the morning dark and releasing a downpour so heavy that we pull off to the side of the road where we share a passing place with the sheep sheltering in the lee of the sea wall. The rain blows over as quickly as it arrived  a hazy silvery sun gradually becoming visible behind the thinning clouds. In only a few moments the sun emerges completely and, where so recently the land lay under the shadow of the cloud, now all is fresh and bright. The sunlight turns the stark winter reeds blond and spotlights the white walls of houses against the backdrop of the retreating dark cloud that has swept onwards to obscure the hills. A double rainbow arcs across the sky and the sheep amble away from the wall to resume their grazing. The sun is still shining when we arrive at the start of our walk. Behind the line of dunes the familiar landscape has been transformed by weeks of rain; a new loch has appeared, stretching ahead of us as far as we can see, the parallel indentations that mark the route of tractors along the foot of the dunes disappearing below the waters and then re-emerging a little further along. Greylag geese feed busily on the grassland between the permanent loch and this new creation, which has already attracted its own visiting whooper swans and tufted duck. We follow the new loch to its end and then climb to the dune ridge  before us the white sands of the beach stretch away to north and south but though the sun still shines, the horizon is already darkening ominously once again.",

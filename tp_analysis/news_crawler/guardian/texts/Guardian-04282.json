    "text": "Universities may have good intentions  but in practice, being eco-friendly isn&apos;t always high on the agenda. Following on from next week&apos;s launch of the People and Planet Green League  which ranks universities to show how well they manage their environmental impact  we will be hosting a live Q&amp;A with sustainability experts and students. Join us from 1-4pm next Tuesday to discuss the ways in which universities can tackle their carbon footprints  and how students can benefit from green policies. Would you consider a university&apos;s environmental record before applying for a degree? Perhaps your own university has introduced a successful scheme. Share your opinions and questions in advance by posting in the comments section below. Our panel: Debby Cotton is head of educational development and pedagogic research at Plymouth University. Danielle Gufferty is vice-president of society and citizenship at National Union of Students, and campaigns on environmental and ethical issues. Dr Gill Coleman is co-director of the sustainability and responsibility programme at Ashridge Business School and a faculty member for the doctorate in organisational change. Dr Chris Seeley is co-director of the sustainability and responsibility programme at Ashridge Business School. She is also a faculty member for the Ashridge doctorate in organisational change. Louise Hazan is the creator and compiler of the People &amp; Planet Green League and supports students campaigning to improve the environmental record of universities.

    "text": "Nintendo has announced a deal with free-hotspot.com to provide over 5,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots to 3DS owners throughout Europe. The partnership will include fast food restaurants and hotel chains across the continent including McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, KFC and Subway, as well as Ibis Hotels and Etap Hotels. 3DS owners will need to have downloaded the console&apos;s browser and then performed a system update. Subsequently, if everything&apos;s set up correctly, the device will automatically access compatible Wi-Fi connections, even if it&apos;s in sleep mode. Via the SpotPass system, game updates and other content can then be downloaded onto the console, including a new range of 3D videos. Users will also be able to browse the web for free, or play multiplayer games. In a financial briefing last week, Nintendo chief Satoru Iwata admitted that the company has to simplify its digital offering, making it easier for gamers to shop for Nintendo content online, via the 3DS and forthcoming Wii U consoles. A card-swiping system is reportedly being considered for the Wii successor, allowing users to buy downloadable content by swiping their credit card across the machine&apos;s tablet-style controller.",

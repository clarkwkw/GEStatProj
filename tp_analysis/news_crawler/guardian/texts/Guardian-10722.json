    "text": "     Six years after the Wii console took living rooms by storm, Nintendo is trying to capture the same success with its new Wii U, is to released in the UK overnight on Thursday. But the intervening period has seen a dramatic rise in competition from smartphones and tablets which sell millions around the world every week, and threaten consoles&apos; business model. HMV is to open its flagship Oxford Street store in London for a special midnight launch, treating fans to game demos and goody bags as they queued in the cold to get their hands on the Wii U. The key attraction is the GamePad controller, featuring a camera, motion-detectors and a touch-sensitive display that can show game elements such as maps or inventories, but can also be used to hide information from other players in the same room. The original Wii revolutionised the idea of gaming, letting people play games such as golf, tennis or bowling by mimicking the real-life movements rather than pressing buttons. For Nintendo, which announced its first ever annual losses in 2011  despite making a profit on every one of the 97m Wiis it has sold, and having the lead in the handheld console market with its DS and 3DS models  the success of the Wii U will be intimately tied to its future. But industry figures suggest the new console is less intuitive than its predecessor. &quot;The machine is actually quite hard to understand  or perhaps, to see the point of,&quot; said Oli Welsh, deputy editor of Eurogamer. &quot;The tablet controller works in so many different ways: as an additional screen, as a multiplayer device, as a remote display, as a motion-controlled &apos;window&apos; on the game world. All of these are interesting, but not necessarily compelling reasons to pick one up. It&apos;s definitely a much harder sell for a mass market than the Wii&apos;s motion controller was.&quot; Even Shelly Pearce, Nintendo UK&apos;s marketing director, admitted &quot;it&apos;s a complicated device to explain in words.&quot; So far consumers seem to be reacting positively: the launch in the US on 18 November saw the initial allocation of 400,000 units sell out in a week. But some complained about having to download a huge software update before they could start playing. Others had problems with its Wi-Fi connection for online gaming. Pearce said: &quot;We&apos;ve been watching what&apos;s been going on in the US. They&apos;re pretty much sold out at retailers, and we have done well on pre-orders here too. We know there are already people queuing outside HMV on Oxford Street. I think we&apos;re in a good place.&quot; The challenge for Nintendo will be building on strong early interest. The company plans to shift 5.5m units by March 2013, in line with initial sales for the console&apos;s predecessor. But at 250 for the basic package and 300 for the premium bundle, the Wii U is expensive; the original Wii now sells for around 100. The problem is magnified because since the Wii&apos;s debut, gaming has shifted on to handheld devices, particularly Apple&apos;s iPhone and iPad along with dozens of models from manufacturers using Google&apos;s Android software. This has created a market of almost 1bn devices on which games costing around 1, or are free, dominate  compared with 40 for many console games. That has seen names such as Finland&apos;s Rovio and its Angry Birds game, and more recently atebit&apos;s Letterpress, become hugely popular games. Traditional games developers writing for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii  which together have sold a total of about 233m devices  have struggled to remain profitable outside a few hit games such as the Call Of Duty, Grand Theft Auto and Halo series. Pearce acknowledged the market has changed, but said: &quot;It&apos;s been seven years since Wii launched and the market is ready for a new home console. Yes, the environment is different in terms of competition, but this is always the case when a new generation launches.&quot; But Nintendo won&apos;t have the new home console market to itself for long. Both Sony and Microsoft are expected to announce new consoles next year, with a new Xbox rumoured for Christmas 2013. For high street game retailers in the UK, already under pressure owing to the combined pressures of the downturn, rents and a shift in gaming to downloadable games, the advent of a new console can only help. &quot;The High Street is struggling and entertainment and games retailers have diversified to a ridiculous degree,&quot; said Matt Martin, editor of news site GamesIndustry.Biz. &quot;HMV sells sweets and cans of pop, [the specialist retail chain] Game sells books. They&apos;re fighting for scraps. A new console launch could bring people back into stores to get the hands-on experience  something you can&apos;t get online.&quot; But, Martin added: &quot;The danger is that people sample it in Game and then go to Amazon to order it for 10 cheaper.&quot;",

    "text": "The UN high-level panel to draw up a post-2015 strategy, co-chaired by Britain&apos;s prime minister, David Cameron, is expected to hand in its first draft around March and submit its final report in May, a senior official said on Tuesday. The UN has launched a broad consultation process, which makes the timetable particularly ambitious. The millennium development goals (MDGs), although considered to have had a galvanising effect on the development discourse, were seen as having been foisted on developing countries by donors. This time round, the UN will be co-ordinating consultations in more than 50 developing countries to help gather input. As an example of its outreach programme, the UN has set up a website inviting contributions from civil society. The site is asking for input ahead of next week&apos;s meeting of the three co-chairs of the panel in London. Cameron briefly met his two co-chairs, Liberia&apos;s President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Indonesia&apos;s President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, at the UN general assembly in September. London, where the theme will be household poverty, will be the first substantive meeting of the panel&apos;s 26 members and the UN&apos;s special adviser on post-2015 development planning, Amina Mohammed. Subsequent meetings in Liberia and Indonesia will focus on national development and global partnerships respectively. At a hearing of the international development committee, Mohammed said she hoped the panel would produce a &quot;bold and ambitious report&quot; that would feed into the post-2015 development agenda. While it was too soon to go into detail about the panel&apos;s report, she mentioned a number of themes it will contain: the poverty agenda, conflict, the youth bulge, and how to deal with the unmet MDGs. The existing targets, which were agreed at a meeting in New York in September 2000, set out eight goals for the international community, including eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, and reducing childhood mortality rates. Some of those goals in some countries are expected to be achieved by the 2015 deadline; others most definitely will not. But the MDGs have had an enormous impact on the international donor community and how it spends its money. Some MPs wondered how the panel&apos;s report would mesh with the sustainable development goals that emerged from the Rio+20 Earth summit. Mohammed acknowledged that there were two processes  the high-level panel and a working group on sustainability  but said they shared one secretariat and the end result would be &quot;one development agenda&quot;. Asked who would lead the political process, she replied that it would be the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. According to Charles Abugre Akeylyria, Africa regional director of the UN millennium campaign, the consultation process has &quot;kicked off a bit of a buzz&quot;  both at a national level, where community hearings are planned, and also in regional terms, with the African Development Bank and the African Union pitching in. &quot;This buzz is useful,&quot; he told the committee. &quot;It&apos;s how we pool all this buzz into the report. This is very different from the MDGs, which were concocted by the elite.&quot; Professor Andrew Dorward, from the School of Oriental and African Studies, underlined the difficulty of getting real bottom-up participation, citing the example of poor smallholder farmers. &quot;It&apos;s time consuming and it is difficult to get poor farmers represented, but it&apos;s not unique to agriculture,&quot; he said. More broadly, Dorward said the panel had to decide whether its objective was to mobilise resources, enlist support for the post-2015 agenda, or both. Asked what he thought such a framework would look like, he called for as holistic an approach as possible, combining overarching goals such as wellbeing, health, climate change, population stabilisation and water. As a concept the MDGs had been successful, he said, as they had been easy to grasp and communicate.",

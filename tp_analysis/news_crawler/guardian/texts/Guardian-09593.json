    "text": "The biggest surprise of Sony&apos;s brain-training puzzle package Smart As is its power  running the Unreal Engine software, this is a low-demand game on, effectively, the same platform as physics-heavy action-shooter Dishonored. As a result, it looks unexpectedly pretty. Beyond the gloss there lies a solid collection of mental challenges, split into language, observation, logic and arithmetic categories. Smart As... is designed to be played in small daily doses, gauging your improvement in all four areas and letting you compare results online. With most puzzles taking no more than 30 seconds to complete, it&apos;s a fun way to get the grey matter working. However, the free play mode feels restrictive, with extra puzzle types unlocked only on meeting criteria in other areas. Given that you&apos;re not allowed to even attempt harder levels until you&apos;ve attained a three-star ranking on easy, it can feel like you&apos;re being talked down to by a game designed to rank intellect. There are no prizes here for originality, but Smart As does provide entertaining cerebral exercise, perfectly suited to its portable form.",

    "text": "    Common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor (synonym, Chordeiles virginianus; protonym, Caprimulgus minor), JR Forster, 1771, known by a slew of names, such as the American/Pacific/Florida nighthawk, the western/eastern nighthawk, Asseri nighthawk, Cherrie&apos;s nighthawk, Howell&apos;s nighthawk, Sennett&apos;s nighthawk, or as the booming nighthawk or, my favourite name, the bull-bat, photographed at Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, near Anahuac, Texas (North America).

Nikon D200, Kowa 883 telescope with TSN-PZ camera eyepiece 1/400s f/8.0 at 1000.0mm iso400    Here&apos;s the original mystery bird image:      Question: This North American mystery bird is part of a group of birds known for its strange habits. Can you tell me what some of those strange habits are? Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is a preening common nighthawk, Chordeiles minor, a member of the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae. The bird in the photographs looks very buffy, which is deceptive and confusing, but I think the lighting is accentuating this bird&apos;s buffy plumage colouring.  The common nighthawk shows a lot of plumage variation and may only be distinguished as different from its sister species, the Antillean nighthawk, Chordeiles gundlachii, in-hand. The common nighthawk can be distinguished from the similar-looking lesser nighthawk by:   longer and more pointy forked tail than lesser nighthawk  longer, more pointy wings (the second primary is slightly longer than the leading primary in lesser nighthawks)  when closed, wing primaries are longer than the tail  white wing bar across is midway to the wing tips, not closer to the wing tips, as seen on the lesser nighthawk (I think placement of the white wing bar in these images is diagnostic)  Common nighthawks occupy open lowland areas over much of North America, roosting lengthwise on tree branches, also on rooftops, fence posts and on the ground, relying on its cryptic plumage to conceal it. The winter range is in South America but is not precisely known, although it probably is mostly in Argentina. They are crepuscular aerial insectivores, hunting and eating insects in flight at dawn and dusk.

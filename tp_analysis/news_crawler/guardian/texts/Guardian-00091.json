    "text": "Parents at a south London primary school have launched a fierce campaign against plans for secondary pupils to be brought into the same building for two years. In the latest tale of bizarre free school planning, Paxton primary in Gipsy Hill, which has already expanded from a one-form to a three-form entry primary school, will suddenly see up to 240 year 7s descend on it next year, with a further 240 in the offing for 2018-19. The school has just completed a new building, intended for primary children, giving it space for 630 pupils as it grows from its current roll of 300. There is temporarily some spare space, until the entry cohort reaches year 6. But the secondary pupils could take numbers to 900 within two years, way beyond capacity. The sudden plan seems to have arisen because Gipsy Hill school, a new free school (secondary), due to open in 2017, has yet to secure planning permission for a site four miles away in Clapham. Paxton parents collected more than 600 signatures against the proposals within 10 days of them being announced by Sir Craig Tunstall, the Gypsy Hill Federations chief executive, at the end of last month. The parents worry the site will become cramped, that temporary classrooms will have to be built on a playground that is already small and that its special needs facilities arent equipped to cope. They also fear that the need to separate primary and secondary pupils at lunchtimes will leave children rushing meals, and that the primary faces three years of disruption just as its building work has finished. Parents say they knew nothing of the plans before they were announced, and yet signs were put up at the primary proclaiming it as the home of the new secondary three days later. The federations website is already offering prospective parents tours of the secondarys brand new space at Paxton. On Friday, the parents wrote to the government calling for the plan to be reversed. They have pointed to Lambeth and Southwark council data [pdf] suggesting there will be no shortage of secondary places locally next year, and a council document showing there were concerns about traffic congestion [pdf] even when the primary was allowed to expand. Melinda Styles, who has a daughter in year 1, said: These plans have been dropped on us with no warning or consultation. If Id known this was coming, Iwould never have chosen the school for my daughter. It is unclear what planning processes the proposals will have to go through. The federation declined to comment. Dame Rachel brings policy to the people For too long, the education debate has taken place among elites in Westminster and Whitehall, says Dame Rachel de Souza in her summing-up of why the education world needs a new campaign group she has helped to set up, called Parents and Teachers for Excellence (PTE). One of the depressing things about the education debate in recent times is its politicisation, says the organisations website. The future of education is about our childrens future and it must stand outside of petty political debate. Who could argue? Yet the group itself appears extraordinarily well connected for an organisation seemingly trying to move towards a less elitist approach to policymaking. And, for an avowedly non-partisan body, its links with the Conservative party are remarkable.     Rachel de Souza. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian    For on its advisory council are Rachel Wolf, recently David Camerons lead adviser on education policy; James OShaughnessy, the Tory peer now running free schools who once led Camerons policy unit; Jonathan Simons, another ex-Cameron staffer, now head of education at the Tory thinktank Policy Exchange; and Munira Mirza, a former deputy mayor to Boris Johnson. OShaughnessy and Mirza have both worked for Policy Exchange, as has James Frayne, the Tory public relations guru who reportedly helped set up PTE (and is married to Wolf). PTE was set up as a company by De Souza and the venture capitalist and Vote Leave campaigner Jon Moynihan. De Souza herself, who is so anti-establishment she once sat on the government committee that recommended who among her peers should receive honours for services to education, works for the Tory donor and Policy Exchange supporter Sir Theodore Agnew in her capacity as chief executive of the Inspiration Trust academy chain, of which Agnew is the sponsor and chairman. If this is an attempt to depoliticise policymaking and move it away from an elite, it seems an odd way of going about it. Author joins protest at park development Finally, the author Iain Sinclair is among campaigners against plans by the government and an east London council to build a temporary secondary school on a nature conservation area and parkland.

Photograph: Macnaughton/Rex    We put temporary in quotations as the plan is for the new 540-pupil building of up to four storeys to stand on a section of Haggerston park in Hackney for five years from 2017. In what seems like yet another chaotic free school plan, the building will house pupils from a secondary school that is being built elsewhere in the borough, until that is constructed in 2020. Pupils from another planned new secondary will be moving in between 2020 and 2022. Both are to be sponsored by the City of London academy trust. Sinclair is among those who thinks the area should not be used for anything other than a park. The council has argued the site is a former park depot where a temporary primary school was built in 2007. But residents say the area has always been part of the park and that the development is part of a steady encroachment by the council for various education projects. The school proposal has to be approved by Hackneys planning sub-committee next month. Meanwhile, we have seen a letter from the academies minister, Lord Nash, to the local MP, Meg Hillier, in which he seems to admit that the temporary building, whose construction will be overseen by the governments Education Funding Agency, might not be perfect. Nash writes that the projects must meet, wherever possible, current guidelines for school buildings. Whilst it is recognised that it is not always possible to meet this, particularly for temporary sites, the EFA will ensure that the building is suitable. As reassurances go, this is perhaps not the strongest.",

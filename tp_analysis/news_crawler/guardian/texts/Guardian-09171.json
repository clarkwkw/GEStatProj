    "text": "Roll up, roll up for this week&apos;s roundup of the best new iPhone and iPad apps. Games aren&apos;t included, because iOS games are in the separate weekly mobile/tablet games post, which this week included the likes of NBA 2K13, Payback 2 HD, Re-Volt Classic and Zaxxon Escape. What about Android? Google&apos;s OS gets its own weekly roundup, which was published earlier in the day. TomTom, BBC Good Food, Xero and 17 other new apps can be found there. Here&apos;s this week&apos;s non-gaming iOS app selection: Blue Note by Groovebug Jazz labels don&apos;t come much more iconic than Blue Note Records, which is under EMI&apos;s wing. This iPad app gathers songs, artwork, photos, videos and articles about Blue Note&apos;s artists and back catalogue, with track samples in the initial free download, and full streams if you subscribe for 1.49 a month. It&apos;s developed by US startup Groovebug, and is the first mobile app spawned by EMI&apos;s OpenEMI initiative, which encouraged developers to dig into its archives.iPad Radioplayer Can anything tempt British iPhone-owning radio fans away from TuneIn Radio? Radioplayer is having a go. The company behind it has backing from the BBC, Absolute Radio, Global Radio and other broadcasters, providing streams from a host of UK radio stations, as well as &quot;catchup&quot; shows on-demand.iPhone Givit If I had a pound for every social photo or video-sharing app that I&apos;ve seen go live on the App Store, I&apos;d probably have enough to buy 1% of Instagram. Givit focuses on video, helping you stitch together different clips, add effects and then share them to Facebook and YouTube.iPhone Netbot for iPhone / Netbot for iPad Available in two separate versions, each costing 2.99, this is perhaps the best mobile app yet for Twitter-alternative community App.net. Its developer certainly has the experience for the job: Tapbots is best known for its Tweetbot Twitter app. That app provides the guts for this App.net version, including &quot;smart gestures&quot; to speed up your tweeti... App.netting.iPhone / iPad Digg for iPad The relaunched Digg has split online opinion since it went live earlier this year, aggregating online technology news as before, but with less of the traditional community feel. Already available on iPhone, new Digg now has an iPad version, with a clean, minimalist design, and offline reading features.iPad Mila Mila styles itself as a &quot;smart business assistant&quot; for small companies, with features including invoicing and e-commerce catalogue management. But the app is also pro-active in finding new leads, scanning Twitter and identifying potential customers based on what you&apos;re selling.iPhone Shelby Genius A number of startups are tackling the issue of finding videos to watch on services like YouTube, Vimeo and DailyMotion (yes, but mainly YouTube). Shelby Genius is the latest, pulling in videos from those three sites, while also recommending other clips based on its community. Its aim is to be smarter than the search functions in those individual services&apos; apps.iPhone IntoGardens There are a few traditional print gardening magazines that have been turned into iPad apps, but intoGardens has been designed for the tablet from the ground up. That means video, audio and shopping built into each digital issue, as well as a personal scrapbook section to keep interesting articles. The design is very appealing, while issues cost 2.99, or 9.99 for an annual subscription.iPad Taskbox - Mail &quot;A mobile email client that allows you to swipe your way to inbox zero in less than 60 seconds,&quot; claims Taskbox&apos;s App Store listing. It clearly hasn&apos;t seen my inbox. But the very clever idea here is that Taskbox is a combined email client and to-do list-maker: so while you&apos;re swiping your way to an empty inbox, you can at the same time be creating tasks. Pancake Pandemonium Released to co-incide with its printed book, Pancake Pandemonium is a food-focused story for children with 24 interactive pages, characterful illustrations and cat-hoovering. Which is always nice. A bonus mini-game can be unlocked as children read the story too.iPhone / iPad Wonderbra Decoder &quot;Some things really need to be kept between us girls, right?&quot; notes the Google Play description of this bra-brand app. Those things being QR codes, seemingly. The app lets you scan codes on Wonderbra&apos;s latest round of adverts to digitally remove model Adriana Cernanova&apos;s clothes and examine her lingerie. Then buy it, obviously. It also works with the brand&apos;s new YouTube advert.iPhone Recce - San Francisco The first Recce app was a whizzy 3D map of London released before the Olympic Games. Now its developer, eeGeo, has launched a new version for San Francisco. A snazzier alternative to the 3D views in Apple&apos;s own Maps, this works online and offline, and includes local offers, restaurant and event-booking features, and a database of tourist hotspots.iPhone / iPad TNW Magazine Technology site TheNextWeb launched its longform TNW Magazine for iPad earlier this year, but it&apos;s now been downsized for iPhone too. The content is original, including app, film and book reviews, longer features that haven&apos;t been on the website, and tunes from music site 22Tracks to accompany your reading.iPhone Jamn  The Musician&apos;s Multi-Tool Whether you&apos;re learning to play the guitar, or writing your own songs, Jamn looks like an essential download. It uses a wheel-based user interface to show the relationships between keys, chords and scales, and is hoping to become a useful tool for players, songwriters and music teachers alike.iPhone Birmingham Museums Quiz Yes, it may be a niche in a geographic sense, but this is a good example of how museums and other cultural institutions can be inventive in the apps world. It&apos;s a trivia quiz trail for seven museums around Birmingham (the UK one), with questions on two levels to suit children and adults. It can be played away from the seven sites too, if you&apos;re not within striking distance of the city.iPhone Europa League FourFourTwo Football Stats Zone British football magazine FourFourTwo and stats provider Opta have been working together on apps for some time, with this the latest release. It focuses on the Europa League tournament, providing in-depth stats for every match to aid home analysis of the action being watched on TV. FourFourTwo is also pitching it as a good tool for fantasy football players, although realistically the separate Premier League version is a better bet for that.iPhone Piko - Kid Video Player This one&apos;s US-only, presumably for licensing reasons. It&apos;s a public beta of an app for parents or rather, for their children providing access to TV shows including Yo Gabba Gabba!, Rastamouse, Bo on the Go and Animal Mechanicals. Games and parental features will be added in future updates.iPhone / iPad Camera Awesome With 7m downloads on iPhone, Camera Awesome is one of the more popular apps to replace Apple&apos;s own camera software. Now it&apos;s been ported to iPad, with an emphasis on editing snaps as well as taking them, with a range of effects and filters acquired through in-app purchase.iPad Noisy Nee Naw! This is the latest children&apos;s app from Penguin Books&apos; Ladybird imprint, following hot on the heels of the recent Skullabones Island: Pirates Ahoy! The two apps are similar, with the new one focusing on emergency services rather than pirates. Your child will be steering a fire engine, dressing up various emergency workers, and playing matching pairs.iPhone / iPad Disney American Presidents Another US-only app although it&apos;d be really interesting to see Disney try its hands at a UK version with monarchs or prime ministers. This aims to make the history of the US presidency interesting and engaging for children, with video, music, plenty of talking-heads and content based on the US educational curriculum.

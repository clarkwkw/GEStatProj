Samsung also sells an array of products that Apple doesn&apos;t and setting up the comparison with Apple worked out well for the entire company, Scoble said.  &quot;It only cost $1 billion to become the #2 most profitable mobile company. Remember how much Microsoft paid for Skype? $8 billion. So, for 1/8th of a Skype Samsung took RIM&apos;s place and kicked HTC&apos;s behind...I bet that RIM wishes it had copied the iPhone a lot sooner than it did. So does Nokia, I bet. Samsung is a much healthier company than any of those BECAUSE it copied the iPhone,&quot; he wrote.  Analyst Jeremiah Owyang, of Altimeter Group, agreed saying Samsung still comes out ahead despite the potential ban on sales and punishment. He said Samsung does $1 billion in revenue every 2.4 days.  Tim Cook tells Apple employees that today&apos;s victory &apos;is about values&apos; &gt;&gt; 9to5Mac Cook&apos;s email, in part:   Many of you have been closely following the trial against Samsung in San Jose for the past few weeks. We chose legal action very reluctantly and only after repeatedly asking Samsung to stop copying our work. For us this lawsuit has always been about something much more important than patents or money. It&apos;s about values. We value originality and innovation and pour our lives into making the best products on earth. And we do this to delight our customers, not for competitors to flagrantly copy.  Pressing issues: Pink Floyd&apos;s &quot;soundtrack&quot; to first moon walk &gt;&gt; Greg Mitchell  Here&apos;s another: It seems that Pink Floyd was in a BBC studio in London &quot;jamming&quot; live to the first moon walk. This &quot;soundtrack&quot; was missing for years, then bootlegged, before finally ending up, where else, on YouTube. Here it is:   Goodbye, Neil Armstrong. Stanford researchers discover the &apos;anternet&apos; &gt;&gt; Stanford Report  On the surface, ants and the Internet don&apos;t seem to have much in common. But two Stanford researchers have discovered that a species of harvester ants determine how many foragers to send out of the nest in much the same way that Internet protocols discover how much bandwidth is available for the transfer of data. The researchers are calling it the &quot;anternet.&quot;   Brm-tish. (Brought to our notice by Dan Crow of Songkick, who adds: &quot;it&apos;s my aunt.&quot;) Exclusive: Apple-Samsung juror speaks out &gt;&gt; CNET News Great exclusive for Greg Sandoval:   Apple v. Samsung juror Manuel Ilagan said the nine-person jury that heard the patent infringement case between the companies knew after the first day that it believed Samsung had wronged Apple.  Ilagan told CNET in an exclusive interview that the jury had several sometimes &quot;heated&quot; debates before reaching its verdict yesterday. He also said nothing in the deliberation process was rushed and that the jury carefully weighed the evidence.  &quot;We found for Apple because of the evidence they presented,&quot; Ilagan said. &quot;It was clear there was infringement...What was happening was that the appearance [of Samsung&apos;s phone] was their downfall. You copied the appearance.... Nokia is still selling phones. BlackBerry is selling phones. Those phones aren&apos;t infringing. There are alternatives out there.&quot;&quot;   Worth reading in full as an insight into the jury&apos;s deliberations. Copying Works: how Samsung&apos;s decision to mimic Apple paid off in spades &gt;&gt; PandoDaily Farhad Manjoo:   On Friday, a federal jury decided that Samsung was guilty of doing [copying Apple]. But you don&apos;t need this decision, nor any of the damning internal documents uncovered during the patent case, to realize this. Just look at the devices Samsung released in response to the iPhone - for instance, the 2010 Galaxy S, pictured above. If that&apos;s not copying, the term has no meaning.  It&apos;s tempting, after such a sweeping verdict in Apple&apos;s favor, to conclude that Samsung&apos;s decision to mimic the iPhone was a terrible mistake. The firm will now be on the hook for at least $1bn in damages, and the judge could triple that amount. Samsung will likely face sales injunctions on many of its products, and will be forced to quickly design around Apple&apos;s patents in its current and upcoming devices, if not to pay a steep licensing fee. Other companies that took inspiration from Apple - including Motorola, HTC and, at the top of the chain, Google - will also be stung by this decision.  But if you study what&apos;s happened in the mobile industry since 2007, a different moral emerges. It goes like this: Copying works.   Compared to RIM or Nokia&apos;s choices, you&apos;d have to say it worked for Samsung. And later in the piece:   Samsung&apos;s decision to copy Apple has also been inarguably good for consumers. If it weren&apos;t for Samsung and Google, Apple would have faced no meaningful competition in smartphones--which would have been great for Apple shareholders but terrible for everyone else, including for Apple&apos;s customers.  Jury in Apple v. Samsung goofed, damages reduced - uh oh. What&apos;s wrong with this picture? &gt;&gt; Groklaw  Obviously, something is very wrong with this picture. The Verge also reported that the jury foreman, who is a patent holder himself [this appears to be his patent, &quot;Method and apparatus for recording and storing video information&quot;], told court officials that the jury didn&apos;t need the answer to its question to reach a verdict:   The foreman told a court representative that the jurors had reached a decision without needing the instructions.   That&apos;s why I don&apos;t think this jury&apos;s ruling will stand, among other reasons.  The instructions that the jury didn&apos;t need help with aren&apos;t specified. Note that this was a jury with more technical experience than you&apos;d generally expect to find in a courtroom.

Why your news site should never open external links in a new window &gt;&gt; Martin Belam  Imagine a not-too-distant world where you are manipulating your device mostly by touch and voice, and the whole document paradigm might have vanished. Operating systems might not have &quot;new windows&quot; in the future, just as browsers didn&apos;t used to have tabs.  Opening up an external link in a new window basically shouts out &quot;Darling, don&apos;t leave me!&quot;, with your site sobbing in the background like a jilted lover.

    "headline": "Most graduate recruiters now looking for at least a 2:1", 
    "text": "More than three-quarters of graduate recruiters now use a 2:1 degree as their minimum entry requirement amid an intense scramble for graduate jobs, a poll of top employers has found. A total of 76% now use 2:1 as their threshold, up from 52% in 2004, in order to sift through a high volume of applications for each vacancy. According to the survey, 2.5% of recruiters demand a first. The survey of more than 200 firms, including Accenture, Deloitte, Marks &amp; Spencer and Rolls-Royce, conducted in May, found an average of 73 candidates chasing each vacancy, up from 30 applicants per job before the economic downturn. Retail is the most competitive sector, with more than 150 applicants for each position. Carl Gilleard, the chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), which commissioned the survey, said the use of the 2:1 as a filter was a response to increased competition. He said: &quot;It&apos;s to do with the significant increase in the number of applications that businesses have been receiving. When you&apos;re recruiting 100 graduates  and multiply that by 70-odd applications per job  you&apos;ve got a significant logistical challenge.&quot; Latest figures show 16% of all full-time undergraduates obtained a first in 2011, while 50% were awarded a 2:1, and 28% a 2:2. The average starting salary for graduates is predicted to rise to 26,500, according to the AGR poll. The number of vacancies is forecast to decline modestly by 0.6%. Gilleard said this was a sign of stability. &quot;The graduate job market is inextricably linked to business confidence. It is encouraging to see that employers are still talent-planning for the future and that the number of graduate vacancies is remaining constant.&quot; A separate survey of the graduate job market, also published today, suggests there has been a small rise in the number of vacancies. The poll of 100 leading employers, conducted by High Fliers Research, indicates a 0.9% increase in vacancies. Although there remains a recruitment freeze at many government departments and agencies, graduate vacancies in the public sector are expected to increase by one-fifth this year  in part because of the expansion of the Teach First scheme to get graduates from top universities into schools, the High Fliers Research survey found. Among the employers surveyed in the poll, the average graduate starting salary is expected to remain unchanged for a third consecutive year at 29,000. The most generous salaries are those on offer from investment banks, an average of 45,000, and law firms, an average of 38,000. The public sector, at 22,200, and retailers, at 24,000, have the lowest graduate pay rates for 2012. Graduate recruitment at the leading employers remains below pre-recession levels, the survey found. The total number of graduate jobs on offer in 2012 across all the organisations featured in the research is still 11% below that recorded in 2007. Martin Birchall, managing director of High Fliers Research, said the class of 2012 faces stiff competition to secure a good graduate job this summer. He said: &quot;Employers have already received an unprecedented number of applications for this year&apos;s graduate vacancies, and organisations in several of the most popular career sectors have now filled all their places for 2012 or have closed their applications early.&quot; Commenting on the AGR survey, Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the vice chancellors&apos; umbrella group, Universities UK, said: &quot;There have been some very bleak headlines for graduates over recent years, so it is encouraging now to see real signs of recovery. Employers are investing in graduates, which is good news for them and for current students. &quot;Average starting salaries for graduates are higher than predicted and we are seeing a return to stability in terms of the number of graduate vacancies. This follows three years of flat salaries and fewer graduate opportunities.&quot;",

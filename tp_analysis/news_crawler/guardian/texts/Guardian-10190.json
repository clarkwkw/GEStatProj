    "text": "Quality in TESOL Education (QuiTE), a UK-based association that brings together English language teaching professionals, wants to know why and how people enter the profession. The initial research it has carried out suggests that entrants into ELT are often confused by the information that is available and are making poorly informed judgments about the training courses they choose. There is a wide range of initial training courses on offer in the UK, from the respected Trinity CertTesol and Cambridge Esol Celta qualifications to short online or weekend courses, many of which do not include formal observation of teaching skills. David Phillips, who recently completed a 120-hour certificate course, would have benefited from easily accessible and independent information before he chose his course. &quot;There is a bewildering number of courses and acronyms in the ESL/EFL world. I struggled to understand what the difference was between them, which was to my cost in the end,&quot; said Phillips. &quot;It seems my qualification, without experience, is almost useless in the UK, despite having a nearly identical syllabus to the Celta and Trinity courses.&quot; Teachers such as Phillips need to navigate complex systems of school accreditation to know where a training course will lead to in terms of employment. Accreditation UK, a partnership between the British Council and English UK, the association of ELT schools and providers, is the principal quality assurance scheme for language schools in the UK. While it stops short of requiring that teachers have specific qualifications, it does provide detailed criteria that teachers&apos; qualifications must adhere to in order to support accreditation. In practice there are very few that fit this description, so essentially Accreditation UK has considerable influence over the validity of different initial training qualifications for teachers wishing to teach in the institutions they accredit. There are also stringent accreditation and validation procedures in place for language schools in other countries. Associazione Italiana Scuole di Lingue (AISLi ) is Italy&apos;s national body. According to Julie Wallis, educational officer for AISLi, the schools it accredits are required to employ teachers with &quot;a Celta or equivalent as a minimum requirement&quot;. Many initial Tesol training course providers also have accreditation procedures in place, governed by one of several validating bodies. However, these vary considerably in the criteria they use to award accreditation. Some require a face-to-face training component and assessed teaching practice while others do not. Jenny Pugsley, co-chair of the QuiTE committee and one of the researchers working on its current project, recognises that these facts remain opaque to industry outsiders: &quot;If you try to describe the situation to the man or women in the street it sounds extraordinarily boring. That&apos;s our problem, how to make issues of validation sexy. They&apos;re off-putting, but actually very important.&quot; It is clear that better communication about these issues and the relative benefits of different types of initial training courses is needed. The difficulty is competing with the vast number of websites offering information about ELT courses, and knowing how to steer people to independent and honest advice. &quot;At QuiTE we&apos;ve worked hard on this, but I think we need to work even harder on getting information out to people in an absolutely clear way,&quot; Pugsley said. QuiTE has a website and produces information sheets that are endorsed by key organisations such as English UK and Eaquals, the international language schools accreditation body. However, the way that information about training courses is framed can be complicated. No organisation claiming to give independent advice can risk the potential litigation involved in naming what are perceived to be substandard courses, nor can they show bias by appearing to endorse particular organisations. Would-be teachers are left to grapple with confusing industry concepts and language. &quot;My impression is that people are not spending hours and hours assessing the state of the profession and all the training that&apos;s out there and channelling down to a very refined decision of what they will do,&quot; said Pugsley. One outcome, she believes, is that many people are basing their choices on convenience. It may be that the ideal situation for initial training courses in ELT is an overarching accreditation scheme with clear minimum standards. However, this would be a huge undertaking and it is difficult to see how successful enterprises would be convinced of the need for its services.",

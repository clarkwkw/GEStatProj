    "text": "Our mum, Gwenda Williams, has died aged 93. A primary school teacher who pioneered efforts to extend education provision in south Wales, Gwenda also created a liberal and ecumenical ministry with our dad, the Rev JS Williams. At all times, her success was achieved with humility and grace. She was born into the small mining community of Tumble, south Wales, and trained to be a primary teacher after leaving school. Her first post was in Scunthorpe, but she returned to teach at Tumble in 1940. This brought her into contact with the new young Baptist minister, whom she married in 1942. Marriage meant that she was required to resign from her teaching post, but her sense of vocation remained strong. She persuaded Carmarthenshire education authority to let her home-teach youngsters with physical and learning difficulties. Her contribution was innovative and enduring. We remember her running for the buses that took her on her daily rounds. She also opened her home to the young people of the chapel who had experienced the war and were ready to shape a new world. The political fervour of the years of the postwar Labour government was played out nightly in our kitchen. From 1966, after a move to London, she taught in schools in Havering, culminating in a position as deputy head at Green Street Green primary school. The daily journey involved negotiating the roundabouts of the A13, and her reliance on a moped was a severe test even of her intrepid spirit, but her dedication carried her through. After returning to south Wales in 1978, she taught in Swansea. In 1983, she took great pleasure in planning, opening and running West Glamorgan Education Authority&apos;s first nursery school. When she finally retired from teaching, she found a way to continue to serve by volunteering for the Samaritans. Gwenda moved to Loughborough after our dad&apos;s death in 1986. She is survived by us, her grandchildren, Gwen and Sian, and her great-grandchildren, Emily, Sam, Ondina and Mariza.",

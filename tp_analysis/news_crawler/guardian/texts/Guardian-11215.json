    "text": "Imagine that you run one of the nation&apos;s most successful export industries. You produce one of the world&apos;s most sought-after cars. Designed by the world&apos;s best engineers, these models are so hot that you can&apos;t possibly keep up with demand. Even though you can offer the car to only carefully screened, potential buyers, you can live with that limitation. It only adds cachet. Business thrives. Then the government changes the laws to make entering the showroom harder to do. Your customers will require more scrutiny before they are allowed to walk in to make their purchases. The same goes for your design engineers. Your most promising customers are put off. They decide they will try one of your competitor&apos;s excellent new models. The world-class engineers, uncertain over whether they can come to work and whether they will be allowed to remain, are recruited by more welcoming competitors elsewhere. This story is ridiculous, and yet, to a remarkable degree, it suggests the situation now facing one of the UK&apos;s most successful export industries: higher education. You may not think of a university as an export industry, and that view is understandable. Universities are far more  charged as they are with the mission of creating an informed and skilled citizenry of the nation, the people capable of making the British economy thrive for its own people, and serving as the thought leaders in an increasingly complex world. But we do run an export business, and increasingly so. We export education, purchased by customers and designed by intellectuals from all corners of the globe. Our customers work hard to gain the intellectual skills and money needed to access a UK degree, and a key source of that degree&apos;s value stems from professors of world stature. These are world&apos;s strivers. They are ambitious people who are not satisfied by staying at home and buying the local version. The university is part of the knowledge industry, a business whose stock and trade is intellect and information. These commodities know no border, and those who would impose ever harsher ones to deter movement do so at their own peril. The best and the brightest have the option of many destinations. Let me firmly state the obvious: we want them to come here to the UK. We want the best of them to come to learn and, perhaps, to go back to their birthplaces, with the skills to improve their homelands only with added goodwill towards the UK that will lead to untold business, diplomatic and political windfalls. Or they may want to consider staying here. And, we may want to consider inviting the best of them to remain. The government&apos;s tightening of the screws on the &apos;problems&apos; raised by student immigration and visas, is only the latest indication that it has embraced a flawed and costly notion. The broader message is that foreigners arriving on our shores are a problem. We all agree on the need to address threats of terrorism, fraud and abuse, but the message extends dangerously beyond these legitimate concerns. Recent turns toward procedures that are far more onerous than need be and the tendency of our own government&apos;s immigration process to treat individuals with such disdain it could be called contempt reflect a deeply failed vision of our nation&apos;s problems. These views are out of step with the times and out of touch with reality. These moves seem to reflect an unstated but underlying fear that we, the British people, lose when outsiders come here. Under this kind of calculus, the arrival of one immigrant comes at a cost for one UK citizen. A son or daughter doesn&apos;t get a spot in the university, so it must be because a foreigner took the slot. A man can&apos;t find work, and so a foreigner here must be to blame. In this view, the University of Manchester erred in hiring Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, both Russian immigrants, for jobs that ought to have gone to two physicists in the UK. Two years ago Geim and Novsolev were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for the invention of grapheme, the world&apos;s thinnest material which is said to be 20 times stronger than steel. Their work not only has brought prestige to the UK and its universities, but also has introduced new materials that have the potential to revolutionize manufacturing for commercial and military use worldwide. You do the math. Our own department&apos;s research shows what a flawed stance the view of the need for protection against immigration to universities is and from virtually any perspective. Andrew Oswald suggests that we need to import academic talent if for no other reason than to cover our losses  more than half of UK-born elite scientists leave the country. Sharun Mukand has suggested that a policy shift to globalise labour markets has the potential to be a key tool in alleviating poverty and spurring development. Work by Nicholas Crafts offers historical perspective, his analysis offering a cue from the decline that resulted in British manufacturing when it failed to maintain competitiveness on the world stage. Crafts leads the Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (CAGE), whose mission it is to find the key ways for nations around the world to improve their economies and to enhance the well-being of their people. The work is difficult and on-going, but I am confident in saying that thus far, no one has found that cracking down on foreigners offers the way forward.

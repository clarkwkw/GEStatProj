    "text": "Rppell&apos;s black chat, Myrmecocichla melaena (synonym, Thamnolaea melaena; protonym, Saxicola melaena), Rppell, 1837, also known as the black chat, as Rppell&apos;s (Rueppell&apos;s) chat or, according to email from a reader, as the chiru by the indigenous Etritrean peoples, photographed at Lalibela, northern Ethiopia (Africa).  Image: Dan Logen, 9 February 2011 (with permission) [velociraptorize].Nikon D300s, 200-400 mm lens at 400, f/5.6, 1/800 sec, ISO 800    Question: This handsome African mystery bird is endemic to Ethiopia and Eritrea. It also is placed into several taxonomic families, depending upon which authority you are referring to. Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family(ies) and species? Response: This is an adult Rppell&apos;s black chat, Myrmecocichla melaena. It is locally common in its very small range, being found exclusively in highland rocky areas with waterfalls. It was originally placed with the thrushes into Turdidae but some authorities have removed it into the Muscicapidae family (chats &amp; Old World flycatchers). However, there are more than 500 passerines in the Turdidae-Muscicapidae lineage, and the relationships between them are a gigantic tangled mess, so we really won&apos;t know much until the entire lineage has been subjected to extensive study and revision.  This monomorphic species resembles the white-fronted black chat, M. albifrons, but Rppell&apos;s black chat is easily distinguished by its larger size, by the lack of white on its forehead, b y the presence of a bold white underwing patch (only visible in flight) and by its preference for higher elevations.

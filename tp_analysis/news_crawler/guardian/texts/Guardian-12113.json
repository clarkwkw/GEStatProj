    "text": "Initial teacher education in ELT deserves more attention than it often receives. Over 10,000 people follow Cambridge Esol Celta courses every year. Add in the popular Trinity College London CertTesol programme and the myriads of other introductory courses and a huge number of new teachers are entering classrooms for the first time, with each one impacting on the lives of countless people. Training courses for teachers vary enormously, from BEd programmes lasting up to five years through to taster courses of a few hours and the constraints facing each course will vary accordingly. Despite the differences there are certain features that we should expect courses to address to a greater or lesser extent. First of all, initial teacher education needs to equip prospective teachers with some basic teaching competencies  abilities such as being able to grade language appropriately, the ability to convey the meaning of new words, phrases and grammatical patterns and to respond to learners&apos; production of language. In other words, courses need to be highly practical because teachers learn to teach by teaching and if they are equipped with basic competencies they are more likely to be able to get through the first weeks and months of teaching while still providing positive experiences for learners. So initial teacher education needs to prepare the ground for teachers to learn on the job. The dominant model of teacher learning is through reflective practice. This envisages teachers asking themselves what they do, why they do it and assessing possible alternatives. Teacher education programmes need to both stress the importance of reflection and give guidance on strategies that can be used for making it effective. For example, small groups of teachers working together to reflect collaboratively on their practice may achieve more than a teacher working in isolation. The group dynamic not only allows for ideas to be co-constructed, so that an initial thought is developed and built upon by others, but can also lend a structure and discipline to reflection, which is easily lost when new teachers are under pressure to teach a lot of lessons in a week. So courses that are usually characterised as being &quot;training&quot; oriented need to ensure that the seeds are sown for a teacher&apos;s future independent development after the course. New teachers will learn from other teachers and they also have a responsibility to support others in a reciprocal manner. New entrants often value talking to other novice teachers because they feel that there is less likelihood of being negatively judged. Understanding the need to work with colleagues in a mutually supporting and collaborative manner should be another goal of teacher education programmes. All new entrants into teaching bring with them previous experiences and assumptions that influence what they learn. Research has shown that input on teacher education courses will be understood according to participants&apos; existing knowledge and beliefs about teaching. Even prospective teachers who have never themselves taught will have had years of experience of classrooms and will have developed beliefs about good and bad practice. However, this set of knowledge and beliefs may not always stand up to much scrutiny at a more evidence-based level. In my experience, for example, many new teachers start with the belief that languages are learned principally through imitation, which suggests a tendency towards behaviourist informed learning and teaching. Opportunities need to be created on courses for teachers to discuss these assumptions and where necessary contradictory evidence needs to be introduced so that teachers become more open to incorporating new techniques into their teaching repertoires. As well as helping an individual to develop a range of teaching techniques and to be reflective, courses also need to promote methods of teaching that are locally relevant. In other words, courses must take into account the teaching context in which a prospective teacher is likely to work and promote methodological approaches that are appropriate. Contextual variables may include expectations about the role of the teacher, styles of learning, class sizes, reasons for learning languages and so on. This is a huge challenge for courses such as Celta, where a single syllabus is delivered through centres around the world. In these &quot;global&quot; cases, perhaps the most realistic outcome is to ensure that trainees understand that contextual factors mean that they cannot rely on a single &quot;right&quot; way to teach and that they need to adapt their practice to suit the local context. This is not an exhaustive list of what we can expect from initial teacher education programmes, but given that initial teacher education programmes impact on so many people&apos;s lives, it is important to set out principled criteria by which they can be evaluated.

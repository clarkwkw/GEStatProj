    "text": "More than any other generation, we know what it means to have to pay for an education. Now some of us are getting in on the act and profiting from younger students&apos; desire to achieve. As term rolls on and student loans dry up, that tutor recruitment leaflet left in your pigeon hole seems all the more attractive. It&apos;s not a bad deal. A one-hour session can pay up to 40  which is a lot more than the local cafe. And helping someone to learn is satisfying work, especially if you&apos;re passionate about your subject. Despite the recession, the private tuition industry is booming  the proportion of teenagers receiving home tutoring has increased from 18% in 2005 to 23% in 2011, according to a survey of 11- 16-year-olds commissioned by the Sutton Trust. In London, the figure is even higher, at 38%. And it&apos;s mostly students doing the teaching. Peter Edwards, from Blue Tutors, told me: &quot;We take on a lot of students. Quite a significant number are recent graduates who tend to work for a year while they&apos;re studying for a masters, or doing their law-conversion course. &quot;Students have obtained their qualifications more recently than experienced tutors, and they tend to empathise with students  there are no language barriers.&quot; But is private tutoring playing a part in widening the social divide? There&apos;s already a gulf between the numbers of rich and poor students applying to university. And a higher proportion of private tutoring is directed towards wealthy teenagers  25% of those from the most affluent homes have tutoring compared with 15% of those from the poorest. When I spoke to Dr Lee Elliot Major, director of research at the Sutton Trust, he said he was concerned about the effect of the burgeoning private tutoring industryy. &quot;There&apos;s a social mobility arms race  and in recent years the battleground has gone beyond the school gates. It&apos;s not just which school you send your children to, it&apos;s how much private tuition you are doing over and above that.&quot; Through the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), a charity that tackles educational inequalities, the Sutton Trust is now funding a social enterprise scheme in Manchester, where university students provide one-to-one tuition in local schools. The students are paid for their work  between 10 and 15 per hour  but they are required to give one hour of free tuition for every six hours of paid work they secure. The scheme won&apos;t just help deprived pupils achieve, it will also provide some long-needed data on the effectiveness of one-to-one tuition  especially when it&apos;s students doing the teaching. Can a student explain complex ideas where a qualified teacher has failed? If the project is a success it may be rolled out in other big cities. Students would then have the choice of working for less money knowing they are benefiting disadvantaged pupils or swallowing any misgivings and taking the better pay offered by the private tuition industry.",

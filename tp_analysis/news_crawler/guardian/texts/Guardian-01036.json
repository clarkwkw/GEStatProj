Youll start out by learning about the theory behind dentistry, covering a range of topics from anatomy, physiology, microbiology, human disease, pathology and epidemiology. Youll also learn about the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders. Later in your course youll gain more practical experience and will spend time in the community learning about orthodontics, sedation or minor oral surgeries.

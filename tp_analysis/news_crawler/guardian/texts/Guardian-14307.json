    "text": "The NUS has elected Toni Pearce, the current vice-president for further education, to replace Liam Burns as president this summer. Pearce, who will be the first NUS president not to hold a degree, says she&apos;ll put further education (FE) back on the agenda. &quot;Higher education and further education students face many of the same problems  from student finance to the lack of affordable accommodation, we should tackle these together.&quot; &quot;We&apos;ve started to really prioritise the work that we do for FE students. A few years ago making a campaign like further education loans a priority on the national agenda would have seemed a bit odd, and we might not have done it. We&apos;ve come a long way.&quot; Pearce, who had the backing of outgoing president Liam Burns, won a 57.8% share of the votes. She beat competition from Vicki Baars, the most left-wing candidate (28.7%) and Peter Smallwood, a rare Tory candidate (12.4%). The election&apos;s protest candidate, an &quot;inanimate carbon rod&quot;, which was represented by UCL student Sam Gaus, withdrew from the race on Tuesday morning. Pearce will use her time as president to campaign for a new postgraduate funding system, a replacement for education maintenance allowance (EMA) and better pay for apprenticeships. She also plans to campaign for a single Ucas system for further and higher education. But a national demonstration will not help achieve these goals, she added: &quot;This year is about returning to campuses and reconnecting with students.&quot; In his last conference speech delivered as president, Liam Burns also warned that demonstrations aren&apos;t the only way to lobby government. Burns was criticised following last November&apos;s demonstration, with many claiming he had failed to fight the trebling of tuition fees. Speaking at the NUS national conference yesterday, he said: &quot;If you stand on this stage and claim that we should demand free education, living grants for all, we will win nothing.&quot; Pearce has been the NUS vice-president for further education since 2011 and was president of Cornwall College Students&apos; Union between 2009-11.  This article was amended on 21 May. It previously stated that Pearce was the second NUS president who does not hold a degree.",

    "text": "   Serguem Jessui Machado da Silva, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    To me, sustainable development means: how can I use all resources responsibly and rationally, reducing the economic, social and environmental impacts, both now and in the future? Over the past 20 years, I have seen many changes in Brazil. Our society is more aware of the environment, and many Brazilian corporations have adopted good practice in terms of sustainability. However, agro-business has advanced into Amazon regions with huge impacts on our ecosystem. One of the biggest transformations that has affected Brazil is the acceleration of immigration to the big cities, with huge impacts on urban infrastructure and violence. Today, civil society is more active in fighting for forest protection and other Brazilian ecosystems. Millions of Brazilians, with support from federal government programmes, have been lifted out of poverty. But the environmental impact has been enormous, with more cars circulating in the cities. My message for Rio+20 is that taking care of our planet is a collective responsibility that needs the involvement of individuals, civil society, business and government at all levels. Indifference and omission cannot be allowed, because we have responsibility for people today and to future generations. I think that Rio+20 will make a difference to my lifestyle and behaviour. I will have more awareness about global and local issues that I need to be involved with and be part of the solution.",

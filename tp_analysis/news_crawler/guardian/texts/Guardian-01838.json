Your move, Apple.  January 2009: iPhone passes 1% mobile phone market share &gt;&gt; PC Advisor A trip down nostalgia lane to a time when the iPhone had just managed to take 1% of the entire global market, including smartphones. Motorola was losing market share, Samsung was growing fast, and some company called HTC had recently launched a new phone running some software called &quot;Android&quot;. The opportunity cost of Windows Phone &gt;&gt; asymco Horace Dediu (who has taken our graph about changing market shares by country and improved it hugely):   the speed with which Android handsets can be developed seems to be a key value of that operating system and one for which Microsoft does not have a good answer. Nokia is now one year into its commitment to the Microsoft platform and it has a very limited portfolio to show for it (and limited sales as well.) As a result, Nokia&apos;s Symbian business evaporated very rapidly. More rapidly than the company anticipated. The dilemma for other vendors may well be how long will it take for them to develop a replacement for their Android portfolio in Windows Phone. The opportunity cost of this switch is subtle and insidious but may be the root of why we don&apos;t see a stampede toward Microsoft. Conversely, Android&apos;s contract-free, implement-at-will availability may be its greatest selling point.   &quot;Opportunity cost&quot; is the economic term for &quot;potential value lost in other areas because of what you choose to do&quot;. Social messaging apps &apos;lost networks $13.9bn in 2011&apos; &gt;&gt; BBC News  Social messaging applications cost mobile network operators $13.9bn (8.8bn) in lost SMS revenue last year, a report has claimed. Analysis firm Ovum studied global use of popular services like Whatsapp, Blackberry Messenger and Facebook chat. It concluded that mobile operators must &quot;work together to face the challenge from major internet players&quot;.   Get popcorn. You already know how it&apos;s going to end. The Invisible War for Components and Production Costs &gt;&gt; Eldar Murtazin Murtazin doesn&apos;t have the best track record for predictions, but his hindsight seems pretty good:   By controlling the resource, aluminum unibody production in this case, Apple left very little space for maneuver for their rivals and ensured low production costs. Other unibody manufacturers can now dictate prices to Apple&apos;s rivals who have to pay. But the production capacities are low so they can only use such chassis in flagship products while Apple is using them in mass products. Apple rivals go to great lengths trying to change this situation: Intel created a fashion for ultrabooks and aluminum bodies seem only natural for them but manufacturers are not able to get enough production capacity to satisfy the demand for aluminum bodies. Instead they use the old trick: they make &apos;aluminum sandwiches&apos; - aluminum sheets cover a plastic chassis. Naturally, this solution is not very elegant though it costs slightly cheaper (applicable to laptops $1000+). This solution is too expensive to be used in laptops in the below $1000 bracket so manufacturers are forced to use all sorts of plastic there. This is a result of insufficient supply of needed components.   Which explains a lot about ultrabooks and their pricing and Intel&apos;s venture fund for them. There&apos;s some interesting suggestions too that Apple is looking to tie up lots of plastic for its phones. Heavy Hangs The Bandwidth That Torrents The Crown &gt;&gt; Andy Ihnatko&apos;s Celestial Waste of Bandwidth (BETA) Ihnatko rebuts the arguments used by The Oatmeal over how if you can&apos;t get it legally now, well damn, you&apos;ll get it illegally now:   I&apos;m reminded of a Louis CK joke. I&apos;m going to clean up a little because I&apos;m not Louis CK and this isn&apos;t a live comedy stage. It really wouldn&apos;t come across the same way otherwise. &quot;I&apos;m totally opposed to stealing an Xbox. Unless Microsoft sets a price for them that I don&apos;t want to pay, or there&apos;s a new model in a warehouse somewhere and it won&apos;t ship to stores for another few weeks. Because what else am I going to do? Not have that Xbox? That&apos;s no solution!&quot; The world does not OWE you Season 1 of &quot;Game Of Thrones&quot; in the form you want it at the moment you want it at the price you want to pay for it.

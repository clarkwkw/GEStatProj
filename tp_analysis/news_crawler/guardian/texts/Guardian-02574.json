    "text": "    Can DNA reveal where in a city that an animal comes from? To answer this question, Jason Munshi-South, an assistant professor in the department of natural sciences at CUNY&apos;s Baruch College, looks at DNA of New York City&apos;s native newts, coyotes and mice and finds that they can quickly develop genetic differences.    Professor Munshi-South&apos;s lab is interested in documenting the behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary impacts of large-scale human disturbance, such as logging or oil fields -- or urbanization -- on wild vertebrate populations. His team studies changes in DNA and have made some interesting discoveries. For example, they can pin-point exactly which city park that a white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, comes from. The white-footed mouse is a native species that lives in natural areas independently of humans, unlike the appropriately-named house mouse, Mus musculus, an alien pest species that infest people&apos;s dwellings and are dependent upon humans.       If they&apos;re lucky, individual wild mice will live 12-16 months. Because mice have such short life-spans, their DNA changes fairly quickly. And because city parks are usually islands of green isolated by a sea of concrete, each park&apos;s resident mice represent a discrete population.  But obtaining this information is just the beginning: armed with these data, Professor Munshi-South&apos;s team is trying to understand why these genetic differences came about and what these changes indicate about the urban environment. To do this, they are now following individual city mice to see how their lives differ from those of their country mice relatives.

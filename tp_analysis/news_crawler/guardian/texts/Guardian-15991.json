Click here to view Fuse is an alien substance that handily powers a breed of secret super-weapons, some of which your four-person team manages to get its hands on after the rest are stolen. Your job is to hunt down and shoot the mercenary thieves, in a process that&apos;s nearly identical to many other third-person action games. Your team is a dispiriting clutch of nonentities, carefully drained of character until they&apos;re mere cyphers, filling the gaps between gunfights with banal reiteration of plot points. Although mechanically sound, Fuse&apos;s formulaic milieu and lack of distinguishing features make you yearn for more of its flashes of wacky humour (such as your most meat-headed team member&apos;s fear of cats). Without big characters or memorable set-pieces, it&apos;s reduced to a humdrum series of arenas filled with tedious waist-height barriers, and while there&apos;s pleasingly ludicrous weaponry to accumulate, it&apos;s not enough to stave off overwhelming apathy.

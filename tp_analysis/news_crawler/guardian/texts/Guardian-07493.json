    "text": "The annual Perseids meteor shower should have peaked during Britain&apos;s daylight on Sunday, bringing us strong displays on Saturday and Sunday nights, with rates declining over the coming days. Perseids stream from the constellation Perseus as it climbs through the NE and E sky overnight. Meanwhile, Nasa&apos;s triumph in landing its Curiosity rover on Mars has come as the planet itself is sinking ever lower into our WSW evening twilight. It lies almost 3 below Saturn as it passes between Saturn and Spica at present, but it sets less than 100 minutes after the Sun. Last month our focus was on Lyra and the bright star Vega which now stand just to the S of overhead at nightfall. Vega, of course, is the brightest star in the Summer Triangle whose other corners are marked by Deneb and Altair, respectively very high in the E and lower in the SSE. It is on the right edge of the Triangle, on the line joining Vega to Altair and a little closer to Altair, that we find one of the most interesting small asterisms in the entire sky. Dubbed the Coathanger since it resembles an inverted coat-hanger, it is also reminiscent of the Starship Enterprise. Known formally as Collinder 399 or Brocchi&apos;s cluster, binoculars show it easily and it is a naked-eye object under good conditions, being first recorded by the Persian astronomer Al Sufi in the 10th Century. It was long thought to be a real star cluster, but recent precise measurements using the Hipparcos satellite prove that its stars lie at very different distances and that its pleasing pattern is simply another chance alignment. The Coathanger lies within the boundaries of the dim constellation of Vulpecula the Fox whose brightest star shines at only mag 4.5 and lies 3 S of the beautiful double star Albireo which marks the beak of Cygnus. Vulpecula also boasts the famous Dumbbell Nebula, Messier 27, an even finer example of a planetary nebula than the Ring Nebula in Lyra. Binoculars show it as a small fuzzy blob while it takes its name from its hourglass appearance when viewed telescopically. It measures 8 by 6 arcminutes, shines at about mag 7.5 and stands some 1,400 ly (light years) away. South of Vulpecula lies the more distinctive and ancient constellation of Sagitta which Greek mythology tells us is the arrow used by Hercules to kill Aquila the Eagle. It is one of the smallest constellations; only Equuleus and Crux, the latter never seen from Britain, being smaller. Sagitta&apos;s main point of interest is Messier 71, M71 on our chart, a loose globular cluster of stars that lies some 12,000 ly away. Binoculars or a telescope show it as a 8th mag smudge some 7 arcminutes wide.",

    "text": "There is no greater influence on the Earth and its space environment than that of our local star, the Sun. The level of solar activity, as indicated most clearly by the number of sunspots, ebbs and flows over an average cycle of 11 years as does the frequency of solar flares. Such energetic outbursts can blast the Earth with X-rays and UV and drive solar material earthwards to produce aurorae and disrupt communications and satellite systems. Meanwhile, the Earth&apos;s atmosphere expands and contracts in phase with the cycle, its resistance affecting the longevity of satellites as they spiral downwards towards re-entry. The cycle last peaked in March 2000, so we might have expected the next solar maximum in 2011. In fact, the intervening minimum occurred as recently as December 2008 and analysts are anticipating that the maximum will come in the next few months, and it may even be occurring now. They cannot be sure until the long-term average is calculated next year. As if on cue, a large sunspot that was just emerging around the Sun&apos;s E limb unleashed four X-ray flares earlier this week, each of them more powerful than anything seen so far in 2013. That spot is approaching the Sun&apos;s central meridian this weekend and should be obvious if we can view the Sun safely. To avoid serious eye damage, though, never look directly at the Sun through binoculars or a telescope. Instead project its image onto a white card or use an approved solar filter.",

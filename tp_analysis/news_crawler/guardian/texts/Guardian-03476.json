    "text": "Miyamoto&apos;s career at Nintendo has been defined by his tenacity. His creative commitment to perfection delayed the launch of the Nintendo 64 by three months to afford his team time to finish the game of his vision. &quot;A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad,&quot; he quipped at the time. More recently, he has contended with a troubled launch for the Nintendo 3DS. &quot;Especially for the first six months following the system&apos;s release, sales were weaker than the DS. This was mainly due to the fact we didn&apos;t have any big first party titles, I believe. Also the price point was too high. &quot;In fairness to us, we realised that, reduced the price and worked very hard to have a strong lineup for the Christmas season, which we offered with Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7 and Kid Icarus. &quot;Looking at the situation in Japan today, the console is selling very well. We have now sold 5m consoles there, which is respectable for a console in its first year. The challenge now is to continue to put effort into making the 3DS more widely known. The Louvre guide is another way of doing that.&quot; There&apos;s humility to Miyamoto&apos;s analysis of the 3DS&apos;s fortunes to date, even if, when I ask him what he might have done differently, his solution is to fall back on old ideas and past successes. &quot;If I could rewind the clock I would change the lineup for the 3DS launch so it had more Mario titles. Not only that, but we also have some excellent features that appeal to non-gamers: 3D photography, the augmented reality features and other preinstalled apps. We tried hard to communicate these, but we failed. If I could go back I would have communicated these things differently, and spent more time working out that message.&quot; When I ask whether some of the hardware&apos;s failure to inspire sales might be down to the core selling point  stereoscopic 3D  being gimmicky, Miyamoto is indignant. &quot;Actually, 3D is really the most normal thing because it&apos;s how those of us with two eyes usually see the world. TVs are the unusual things in 2D! We don&apos;t look at stereoscopic as a gimmick. It&apos;s rather the most normal way to display things.&quot; The battle for hearts and minds The obsession with targeting &quot;non-gamers&quot;, as Miyamoto puts it, has defined Nintendo&apos;s recent output, a direction the company took following the mainstream success of the Wii console and game-lite software such as Dr Kawashima&apos;s Brain Training and Wii Fit. &quot;There are big lines between those who play video games and those who do not. For those who don&apos;t, video games are irrelevant. They think all video games must be too difficult. We want to remove that barrier,&quot; he said at the time of the Wii&apos;s launch. That work continues today. Indeed, one of the most successful features of the 3DS has been StreetPass, software that detects when another 3DS is in the vicinity and adds the owner&apos;s avatar to your own system, in a kind of human zoo (&quot;I just heard today that people in France meet to Street Pass one another. That kind of phenomenon is happening!&quot;). But in recent times the new focus has been sharpened by Apple&apos;s land grab for the hearts and minds of casual players. Indeed, Nintendo&apos;s immediate plan for the 3DS is an overhaul of the eShop, the Japanese company&apos;s competitor to Apple&apos;s App Store. I ask him if the plan is to create a more open platform for gamemakers to be able to upload their own games, in much the same way as Apple has lowered the cost of entry for would-be gamemakers hoping to publish their titles to iDevices. &quot;Obviously that would mean making development tools more easily available,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe we should look into it but any tools we offer would need to be supported. From my perspective, we want to reach out to smaller studios and work on smaller projects while supporting them as an easier and faster way to get smaller studios involved. That would be the best way to go.&quot; Apple&apos;s entry to the handheld market has caused Nintendo some problems in envisioning its next move in handheld system innovation. &quot;Obviously a lot of the potential of handheld game systems can now be covered by smartphones,&quot; he says. &quot;When we think about new hardware we need to think about what things we can add that you can&apos;t currently do with a smartphone. For us, we would need to have a good reason to launch a new hardware  something necessary.&quot; The ideas factory It&apos;s this sense that Nintendo is not quite sure what it can offer that&apos;s novel  that has defined the company&apos;s approach to software in recent years as well. While Miyamoto is quick to point out that Wii Sports and Wii Fit are both new game series, he is forced to retreat to the Gamecube release Pikmin in response to the accusation that Nintendo EAD has become conservative in recent years with regard to new game launches. &quot;We need to continue releasing new games in existing franchises otherwise those franchises might die,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s not to say that we aren&apos;t interested in new games. It&apos;s just a case of picking a new game idea. When we have the opportunity we want to create new things in the future, certainly.&quot; With this in mind I wonder if Miyamoto has a yearning to create any particular game that he hasn&apos;t yet been able to? &quot;I don&apos;t have a big list of ideas I want to realise,&quot; he replies. &quot;I usually come up with new ideas while I am working on other games. That said, there&apos;s a strong possibility we will introduce some new characters to the scene soon.&quot; While it&apos;s easy to accuse the company of over-reliance on its established characters, arguably Mario has become a cipher for controlled innovation. For example, Super Mario 3D Land may share an interactive vocabulary with Super Mario Galaxy, but the ideas and execution in each are diverse. This sense of restrained invention reflects Miyamoto&apos;s own primary interest in the medium today. When I ask him what excites him about games, he says: &quot;The key thing is surprising people. Video game development is actually a very easy tool to use to surprise people and to offer new, unexpected things to players. It can actually be done quite easily. It doesn&apos;t take a lot to do this. There are exceptions but games can be created quite easily. I love that.&quot; Now 33 years into his career, I wonder if Miyamoto believes it&apos;s growing hard to surprise people, whether the ideas are running dry? &quot;Yes, it&apos;s become more difficult,&quot; he says. &quot;In the past it was just, you touch a button and something happens on screen and this was surprising enough to people! Like magic. Nowadays we have experienced players and players with no experience and we must accommodate the needs of both groups. It&apos;s becoming increasingly difficult. &quot; &apos;I realised I could actually make a living from this&apos; Miyamoto prefers to talk about Nintendo than himself. &quot;You can ask pretty much anything,&quot; the PR woman told me before our interview, &quot;but he&apos;s specifically asked that you don&apos;t talk to him about his hobbies.&quot; Rather than an indication that Miyamoto has taken up some unspeakable pastimes in recent years, his request indicates a shyness, a natural tendency away from the limelight. When I ask him of which of his games he is most proud, he squirms and looks uncomfortable. &quot;It&apos;s difficult for me to answer,&quot; he says, eventually. &quot;Looking back, Donkey Kong is close to me because it was the first game I made where I realised I could actually make a living from this. Then the title that made games known worldwide was Super Mario Bros. so that&apos;s incredibly important to me. &quot;But this is a very generic answer and maybe doesn&apos;t help you too much. Actually, a big innovation was Wii Sports. With this game we kicked off an adventure into something new. I want to be able to do this bold step many times in my life.&quot; It&apos;s telling that Miyamoto&apos;s choices centre around innovation and breakthrough. What about his games that iterate and perfect on what has gone before? &quot;It&apos;s an excellent point because my desire is always to attempt to perfect my games. I think the Zelda series I am not so deeply involved any more compared to the past, but Skyward Sword is a very complete and exceptionally well-polished title.&quot; Game over? It&apos;s at this point he says that if he weren&apos;t making games today, there&apos;s a very good chance he would not be playing them. Why not? &quot;I think it&apos;s the lack of time in general,&quot; he says. &quot;And maybe I don&apos;t see so many titles that I find fascinating enough that I want to spend time playing. Time is precious and a game has to be worthwhile, right? &quot;Another problem is that there are so many games on the market today that it&apos;s difficult to find the right one. In many ways I think I am in a similar place to the average game player. This is one of the greatest challenges for the industry right now.&quot; It&apos;s a fair point. With tens of thousands of games hitting the App Store each month, the pool of potential avenues for play has broadened and deepened, and the sheer number of options can be overwhelming. I wonder if Miyamoto is concerned for the future of game. &quot;I am not that concerned, actually. Nintendo and I have always hoped that games would someday become a more accepted part of our daily life. Every month this becomes closer to the reality we live in. &quot;Games have grown and developed from this limited in-the-box experience to something that&apos;s everywhere now. Interactive content is all around us, networked, ready. This is something I&apos;ve been hoping for throughout my career. &quot;With this success comes a new challenge of course: how do we make our titles relevant in this world of games. How do we keep going when everything has changed? It&apos;s a huge challenge. But it&apos;s a good one. It&apos;s what we always wanted.&quot; Miyamoto is tired. But he remains undefeated. As he enters the twilight years of his career, the industry is as exciting, diverse, tumultuous and unpredictable as it ever was. Just as it appears as though the medium is creatively stagnating, everything changes again in the wake of some technological advance, or systemic invention. Miyamoto might not play games if he weren&apos;t making them today. But he believes in them and celebrates their ubiquity. And why wouldn&apos;t he? That very ubiquity is his legacy.",

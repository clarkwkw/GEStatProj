    "text": "An internal presentation given in 2010 by Google&apos;s Android boss Andy Rubin has provided some fascinating details on the company&apos;s expectations for its smartphone and tablet OS. The &quot;quarterly review&quot; deck has emerged as part of Google&apos;s patent and copyright infringement trial against Oracle, published in full on technology site The Verge. While Google tends to stick to device activations and total app downloads when providing public updates on the growth of Android, the presentation shows its hopes for revenues back in 2010, and where the company expected them to come from. In July 2010, 20m Android devices had been sold, and 160k more were being activated every day. Rubin&apos;s presentation outlines highlights for Android as being device sales, searches  2.65 a day for active devices  and advertising, with an annual ads revenue run-rate of $120m. Lowlights included Android being &quot;behind on music, video, books&quot;, as well as a &quot;low rate of app purchases&quot; in its Android Market app store, which Rubin contrasted with the company&apos;s key rival: &quot;Apple momentum continues with strong launches (iPad, iOS, iPhone 4) + iBooks&quot;. It&apos;s the predictions of future device sales and Android-related revenues that make the slide deck an intriguing read, however. It reveals that Android had generated $16.8m of revenues for Google in 2009, with $15.7m of that coming from advertising, and $1.1m from app sales. The company was forecasting $278.1m of revenues in 2010, with $158.9m from ads, $3.8m from app sales and $115.4m from &quot;DTC&quot; sales of Android handsets direct to consumers. In the face of opposition from mobile operators, it seems Google had already realised this was a commercial dead-end: the predictions for 2011, 2012 and 2013 don&apos;t include any DTC revenues. Instead, Google was aiming for $507.3m of revenues in 2011 ($492.8m from ads and $14.5m from apps); $840.2m in 2012 ($804.3m from ads and $35.9m from apps); and $1.33bn in 2013 ($1.27bn from ads and $64.8m from apps). That last figure was based on predicted Android app sales of $1.3bn.     Google's predictions for Android revenues. Source: The Verge    Advertising focus The predictions are instructive: in 2010, Google expected 95% of its 2013 Android revenues to come from ads rather than app sales. Developers and publishers who criticise the company for its lack of efforts to boost paid app sales on Android Market (and now Google Play) may see the predictions as ample explanation why. A separate slide predicts Android&apos;s install base on both smartphones and tablets. Google predicted that Android would grow from an install base of 40m smartphones in 2010 to 220m by 2013, with 170m handsets sold in the latter year, by which point Google was aiming for a 25% market share. Meanwhile, Google was hoping 0.5m Android tablets would be sold in 2010, leading to an install base of 35m by 2013, with 15m tablets sold that year, and a market share of 22%. We have data to see how those predictions compare to what actually happened. By February 2012, Google had activated more than 300m Android devices, including 12m tablets, according to Rubin. The slide deck from July 2010 predicted 190m Android smartphone sales by the end of 2012, so the platform is way ahead on that score. Its prediction of 20.5m Android tablets by the end of 2012 isn&apos;t looking in too bad a shape either, if Google&apos;s manufacturing partners shift 8m in the final nine months of this year. Bear in mind the rumours about a Google-branded Nexus tablet launching in the summer. And market share? In November 2011, Gartner estimated that Android had a 52.5% share of the global smartphone market, ahead of Symbian (16.9%), iOS (15%) and BlackBerry (11%). Meanwhile, IDC estimated in March 2012 that Android&apos;s tablet market share in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 44.6% in terms of devices shipped, behind iPad&apos;s 54.7%. Note, this includes forked Android devices like the Kindle Fire and Nook, which Google doesn&apos;t count in its own activation stats. By April 2012, more than 850k non-forked Android devices were being activated every day, according to Google. That compares to around 555k iOS devices (based on Apple&apos;s claim in its last financial results that it sold more than 50m iOS devices in the first quarter of 2012).     Google's predictions for Android smartphone and tablet sales. Source: The Verge    Shifting sands The key thing to remember, though, is that the mobile and tablet market has shifted rapidly between July 2010, when Rubin gave his quarterly update, and the spring of 2012. Apple&apos;s iPad only went on sale in April 2010, and its success has led analysts to continually revise their forecasts for the tablet market ever since. Meanwhile, the pace of Symbian&apos;s decline and the travails of BlackBerry were not yet clear, while Microsoft had announced Windows Phone, but smartphones running it hadn&apos;t yet shipped. Things have changed for Google, too. Its predictions for app sales were likely made based on paid downloads, yet since then in-app purchases have become a key source of revenues on Android and iOS alike The Guardian&apos;s recent analysis of the top grossing apps on Android shows how much. Another slide in Rubin&apos;s 2010 presentation focuses on music, predicting that launching a music locker and download store in 2010 would yield Google $46m and $78m respectively of gross revenues, rising to $534m and $906m in 2013. This was the &quot;base case&quot;, incidentally. An &quot;aggressive case&quot; suggested music locker revenues could top $85m and download revenues $117m in 2010, rising to $991m and $1.4bn in 2013 with Google taking a 30% cut of download sales and 50% of locker revenues after costs. Protracted negotiations with music rightsholders are likely to have made a mockery of these predictions though. The Google Music locker didn&apos;t launch until May 2011, and rather than users paying $2.99 a month for it as suggested by the presentation, it was free. The download store then launched in November 2011. Google has not provided public statistics for users, downloads or revenues for either since. Exceeding expectations In summary, though: Android has exceeded Google&apos;s expectations in terms of smartphone sales, but even the much-maligned Android tablet sales aren&apos;t a million miles away from the company&apos;s forecasts  even if they came at a time when the media tablet market was decidedly nascent. And revenues? In October 2011, Google chief executive Larry Page said the company&apos;s revenue run-rate in mobile was $2.5bn, although that&apos;s all mobile devices, not just Android. Rubin&apos;s slides reveal that iOS was generating a run-rate of $281m in 2010 versus $120m for Android, but there&apos;s no way of telling how that ratio has changed since. From an apps standpoint, though, it&apos;s useful to end with another comparison to Apple. If the key to Android being a cash-cow to Google is advertising revenues, for Apple it&apos;s in device sales. Apple generated revenues of $1.9bn from its iTunes Store in the first quarter of 2012 that&apos;s app sales, but also music, video and e-books. By contrast, the company generated $22.7bn from sales of iPhone hardware, and $6.6bn from iPad hardware. If success on these rival ecosystems depends on playing to the bigger priorities of the platform owner, it&apos;s unsurprising that freemium models (albeit driven by IAP as much as ads) are dominating on Android, while investing heavily in creating apps that show off its devices appears to be the way to Apple&apos;s heart on iOS. Google sells ads, and Apple sells devices. That, in a nutshell, is why the battle between the two companies in the smartphone and tablet space is so fascinating.",

    "text": "Abandoning the save-the-day zombie killing of Resident Evils past, Operation Raccoon City casts you as the bad guy. Set alongside the series&apos; second game, the nefarious Umbrella corporation has sent in its corporate army to ensure no evidence of their genetic experiments survives. Each character in this squad-based shooter has a set role and abilities, be they demolitions, surveillance or healing, that can be enhanced through gaining experience between missions. While a solo mode is offered, the game is best enjoyed online with humans in place of the disappointing AI filling your ranks. Multiplayer modes deliver some variety, though mostly adapt familiar tropes such as base defence and team deathmatch. However, while the idea at the heart of Operation Raccoon City is a good one, the execution is lacking. Sloppy melee combat, awkward cameras, and sluggish controls diminish what could have been a great co-op game.",

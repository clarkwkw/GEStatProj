    "text": "Further to articles from John Prescott (For me, life is Tweet, 16 May) and Charles Arthur (What a lot of characters, 16 May), I feel I should point out the glaringly obvious but unstated conclusion. Twitter offers a remarkable opportunity for anyone to have their say  to comment, chatter, criticise and yes, break news, whether of personal or global interest, yet the audience is greatly overstated. There may be 10m user accounts in the UK, but we learn from Charles Arthur that perhaps as many as two-thirds are inactive. Prescott&apos;s comparison with the 9 million national newspapers sold each day thus seems to hold less water than the bottles of beer he wrote about  if you count readership figures, rather than just copies sold, national newspapers&apos; daily reach is much higher(over 20m). Furthermore, though news does indeed move at the speed of a mouse, newspapers are so often the beneficiaries of this, proving to be often the source and destination for much social media traffic. Ourmembers (which, of course, include the Guardian Media Group) provide not just breaking news but also verification, analysis, opinion and a forum for discussion. They will continue to set the agenda and play a vital role in society and our culture. As your editorial implied (In praise of tweets, 16May), people may enjoy dipping in and out of Twitter, but many more still like to bathe in newspaper content.Rufus Olins @rufusolinsChief executive, Newspaper Marketing Agency @nma_uk  The best tweets mirror the most effective letters (Editorial, 16.5)  76 characters.Keith FlettLondon",

    "text": "&quot;Guardian blogger defends polygamy and attacks C4M,&quot; screamed The Christian Institute website today. Their response to my piece on gay marriage this week was enthusiastic, but I felt it missed a number of the salient points I made; in particular all of the ones about gay marriage.  It was a mistake to mention polygamy in my fisking of the Coalition For Marriage campaign (inexplicably rendered in text-speak as &apos;C4M&apos;). I stand by what I said, but in saying it I fell into the trap of humouring a particularly dumb slippery-slope fallacy commonly deployed against gay marriage.  Ancient Romans called it &apos;argumentum ad vegetation&apos;, which can be summed up as &quot;If a man can marry a man then what&apos;s to stop people marrying plants?!&quot; For example, see C4M director Don Horrocks, who argued in 2006 that allowing gay marriage will lead to &quot;people wanting to marry their horse&quot; (hat tip: Ben Goldacre). If you don&apos;t understand why that&apos;s a stupid argument, then you&apos;re probably still trying to work out what all these funny letter-symbols mean. The Coalition for Marriage&apos;s version of the argument goes: &quot;If marriage is redefined once, what is to stop it being redefined to allow polygamy?&quot;  One answer is that marriage already has been redefined, not once but many times, throughout history and across multiple acts of Parliament.  Another answer is that this is thinly-veiled totalitarianism, which becomes clear when you strip back the terms and realize that the core of this sentence is: &quot;if people are allowed to change laws, what&apos;s to stop them changing them to something we think is bad?!&quot; Democratic societies changing laws can only end in madness and destruction after all. A third answer, and the one I went with, is &quot;so what?&quot;  &quot;What&apos;s wrong with polygamy? It seems to me that a child brought up by three loving parents would have some quite big economic advantages, and humans have cooperated in child-rearing since the year dot.&quot;  Thus the Christian Institute&apos;s indignant response, &quot;Guardian blogger defends polygamy and attacks C4M&quot; - it may not be a coincidence that the C4M.org.uk domain name was registered by a Jon Errington, and that a Jon Errington also works as an administrator at the CI. Their article continues:  &quot;A blogger on the Guardian&apos;s website has denied there is anything wrong with polygamy as he attacked a new group which supports marriage between one man and one woman.&quot;  This seems like a pretty poor attempt at misdirection. You may completely disagree with my views, but at least I had the patience to go through the arguments C4M posted and address each point. Their response has been to grab one quote and suggest I&apos;m a bad man. It&apos;s a bullshit approach to debating a serious issue. Still, it&apos;s an interesting misdirection because it led to the Christian Institute making (or at least trying to make) an evidence-based case against polygamy:   &quot;A study this year showed that societies where monogamy is the norm are safer than polygamous ones. Researchers at the University of British Columbia found that polygamous cultures have higher levels of robbery, rape, kidnapping, fraud and murder. &quot;Professor Joseph Henrich, one of the report&apos;s authors, warned that the crimes were primarily driven by pools of unmarried men, a result of some men taking multiple wives.&quot;  The study they cite is sadly tucked behind a pay-wall. While it makes interesting reading, it&apos;s really about the historical development of social institutions that enforced monogamous marriage and their relationship to the rise of Western civilization, rather than an attempt to put forward a predictive model of the world today.  In other words, it&apos;s feasible that enforcing monogamy helped Europe&apos;s development in times gone by, but the paper makes no attempt to address whether relaxing conventions in 2012 would lead to ruin. That&apos;s if you&apos;re willing to assume the paper&apos;s conclusions have any weight in the first place, which given that it&apos;s one fairly data-poor bit of research is a bit of a stretch - the list of reasons for the success of Western civilization is long and messy, and this is a speculative entry scribbled on the end.  Modern case studies would be more useful, and The Christian Institute are happy to provide one:   &quot;In Holland, where same-sex marriage was introduced in 2001, three-way relationships were given legal recognition through a &quot;cohabitation agreement&quot; in 2005.&quot;   So are gangs of blue-balled Dutch men roaming the streets smashing windows and fucking livestock? Hardly. The Netherlands retains a low crime rate that has been in gentle decline for most of the last decade. I&apos;m not saying that disproves the thesis, but it doesn&apos;t exactly support it either.  Even if polygamy did somehow affect crime rates, the number of people likely to take advantage of such a law in the UK is minuscule, and people who want to have multiple partners are perfectly able to do so now. It&apos;s a struggle to see how the crime rate would be affected either way, and frankly C4M&apos;s arguments sound more like post hoc justifications than the genuine basis for their stance. So I&apos;m happy to defend my comments on polygamy, but I&apos;d rather talk about the C4M campaign. It&apos;s great that the Christian Institute responded to my article, but it would have been nicer still if they had managed to address any of the substantial points raised. Or they could go further and answer the question posed by Ben Goldacre today: who exactly are C4M in the first place? Twitter: @mjrobbins",

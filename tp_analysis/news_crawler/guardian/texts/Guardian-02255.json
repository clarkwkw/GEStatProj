    "text": "Google wants British businesses to put more thought into their mobile web strategies, and has launched a UK scheme called GetMo to encourage them. The GetMo website offers a tool for companies to see how their current website looks on a mobile phone, while providing tips on how to build a more effective mobile site, and information on mobile consumer trends. The scheme is a UK extension of the GoMo initiative that Google launched in the US in November 2011. It also follows the Google Sites Mobile Landing Pages (Google Mobilize for short) scheme from June 2011, which provided small and medium-sized British businesses with templates for their mobile landing pages. &quot;As the smartphone explosion continues, more consumers are looking to engage with brands by searching for them on their mobile phone. Yet the majority of businesses don&apos;t have mobile sites or a mobile strategy for connecting with them,&quot; says Google&apos;s director of mobile advertising for Europe Ian Carrington. &quot;Businesses need to get mobile in order to provide a positive user experience for their customers. At the moment, business are not keeping up with consumers.&quot; Google cites stats from Ipsos CT showing that 93% of smartphone owners in the UK use their handsets to access the web every day, with 84% looking for local information. GetMo includes a guide to &quot;10 Mobile Site Best Practices&quot; (PDF link), which advises businesses to ensure their mobile sites load quickly, have simplified navigation, are &quot;thumb-friendly&quot;, offer local information, use mobile site redirects, synchronise features like shopping baskets with the parent website, are designed for visibility, and are accessible. On the latter point, here&apos;s Google&apos;s advice: &quot;Ideally, your mobile site should work across all mobile devices and all handset orientations. Find alternatives to Flash it does not work on some devices. Use HTML5 for interactivity and animation.&quot; This is a lesson still being learned by many different kinds of businesses. For example, music: Research in March 2011 by ShareSquare found that of the 1,700+ bands playing at the SXSW festival, nine out of 10 didn&apos;t detect or recognise mobile browsers, while a third used Flash. Google is also advising businesses to &quot;listen, learn and iterate&quot; by using analytics to understand how people are using their sites, while collecting user feedback through other means like user testing sessions before and after launch. One of Google&apos;s partners in GetMo is mobile commerce firm The MoBank Group, which works with businesses to add shopping features on their mobile sites. &quot;Statistics show that over 15% of all online traffic is now coming from mobile, therefore retailers that use websites which don&apos;t adequately support mobile transactions are losing the equivalent to one day of business per week,&quot; says its chief executive Dominic Keen. Other partners for GetMo include Boost Communications, Incentivated, InfoGin, Lumata, Madmaker, Mediacom, Movement, Imano, Psycle Interactive, Pure Agency, Sayu, Somo, Sponge, Wapple and dotMobi.",

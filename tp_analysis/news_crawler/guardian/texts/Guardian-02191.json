    "text": "Celebrations of the achievement, five years early, of the millennium development goal (MDG) target on safe drinking water were tempered last week by concerns that millions of people still do not have access to water. This week, government leaders, scientists and business chiefs are meeting at the World Water Forum (WWF) in Marseille, France, to discuss possible solutions to the global crisis. Alongside the six-day international conference, water activists are holding their own alternative forum, which begins on Wednesday, to promote public and community-led water management. Activists have criticised the WWF for promoting the interests of large corporations, rather than the needs of millions of people. Claire Provost, in Marseille, and the Global development team in London will be reporting from both events this week. Tell us on our talk point if there is anything you would like us to try to find out, and what you think are the greatest global water challenges. And send us your photos on water projects. Follow coverage on our new page looking at the issue of water access. Elsewhere on the site The NGO Oxfam called for urgent action to stave off a humanitarian emergency in the Sahel as it launched an appeal for funds. According to the UN, more than 13 million people are at risk of hunger in west Africa. In the run-up to International Women&apos;s Day, we launched a series looking at the politics behind gender policy. Among the articles featured so far, Andrea Cornwall discussed whether donor policies brought sustained change for women; Maxine Molyneux looked at cash transfer schemes, which are targeted at women; and Mariz Tadros debated the use of quotas in politics. Responding to Liz Alden Wily&apos;s blogpost on land deals in Africa, Salil Tripathi and Wambui Kimathi argued that companies investing in land need guidelines to ensure the human rights and dignity of local communities are protected. Meanwhile, looking ahead to the Rio+20 conference in June, Melissa Leach argued that sustainable development goals will not work if the pre-summit debate pretends politics do not matter. Coming up on the site We&apos;ll have all the latest news and opinion from the World Water Forum and the Alternative World Water Forum in France, plus, on Wednesday, a gallery of some of the world&apos;s most controversial dam projects. Phoebe Greenwood reports on a dispute over solar panels in the West Bank, while Anna da Costa looks at an organic farming project in India. We&apos;ll be looking at the impact of oil on Ugandan communities and we&apos;ll be reporting on development projects in Jordan and the West Bank. And after such a great response to our call for your photos for International Women&apos;s Day, we&apos;re hoping to publish another gallery of your images this week. Have a look at other readers&apos; pictures in the Flickr group and see how to add yours there, or email them to us via development@theguardian.com. Multimedia Video: Niger faces food shortages Poor rains and a bad harvest in 2011 has left an estimated 5 million Nigeriens at risk of hunger in the coming months. Effective food distribution could avert disaster in the coming months, but long-term solutions are needed to prevent future emergencies. Celeste Hicks visits projects in the central Keita region, one of the most badly hit areas of the country.

Here are some of your comments: On Claire Melamed&apos;s blog on inequalities, zohramoosa claimed:  Even where race is apparently more relevant to someone&apos;s lack of access to rights, for women, this process will be gendered, ie for a woman of colour, her experience of racism is affected by sexism.  Elizabeth Arend&apos;s critique of the World Bank&apos;s policies on maternal health attracted a number of comments, including those from the World Bank and Marie Stopes International. One commenter, hippongo, pointed out:  The question this article raises is how the World Bank&apos;s general approach to healthcare is reflected in the structure of its development projects where sustainability can only be achieved if there is parallel economic development.  On Andrea Cornwall&apos;s blog arguing that donor policies fail to bring real and sustained change for women, SarahWomankind asked:  Hospitals and trained nurses are important but what if a woman isn&apos;t allowed to leave her home without the consent of her husband?  And on Maxine Molyneux&apos;s blog about why cash transfers do not address the underlying causes of women&apos;s poverty Purna1 commented:  Yes, work with mothers to improve the lives of their children, including by raising the incomes of the poor. Of course. But work with mothers because women matter, independent of their children. Work with women who are not mothers because they are human too.  Highlights from the blogosphere Aurelien Kruse looks into the unchartered waters of Somalia&apos;s economy to identify whether the country is reaching &quot;a development moment&quot;. Mary Robinson claims on the DfID blog that resilience is the new watchword for women. And Duncan Green writes that the only interesting question to ask about Kony2012, the video on LRA leader Joseph Kony that went viral last week, is why it got 60m hits. And finally  The Poverty matters newsletter will be back in two weeks with another round-up of the latest news and comment.

    "text": "Prime minister Margaret Thatcher&apos;s masterful way of handling interruptions inspired one psychologist to study, intently, how she did it. As this scholar communicated his findings to the public, other scholars, with different views, interrupted him  and he them. Geoffrey Beattie is now a professorial research fellow of the Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester. Or rather, was  he reportedly was sacked after I wrote this column but just before it was published. In 1982, while at the University of Sheffield, Beattie published two studies about Thatcher. The first, in the journal Semiotica, says: &quot;Mrs Thatcher&apos;s interviews display a distinctive pattern  she is typically interrupted more frequently than other senior politicians, and she is interrupted more often by interviewers than she herself interrupts  Butting-in interruptions  occur where her interviewer interrupts but fails to get the floor.&quot; The second study, called Why Is Mrs Thatcher Interrupted So Often?, appears in the journal Nature. Beattie (and two colleagues) analysed how Thatcher deployed her voice, words and gaze when Denis Tuohy interviewed her on the television programme TV Eye. The study explains that most people use fairly standard cues with each other, as to when each will stop or start talking. But, it explains: &quot;Many interruptions in an interview with Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister, occur at points where independent judges agree that her turn appears to have finished. It is suggested that she is unconsciously displaying turn-yielding cues at certain inappropriate points.&quot; Peter Bull and Kate Mayer of the University of York disagreed. They and Beattie argued, slowly, in public, mostly in the pages of the Journal of Language and Social Psychology. In 1988, Bull and Mayer wrote a treatise called Interruptions in Political Interviews: A Study of Margaret Thatcher and Neil Kinnock, saying their &quot;results were quite contrary to what might have been expected from the work of Beattie&quot;. Beattie replied with Interruptions in Political Interviews: A Reply to Bull and Mayer. A year later, Bull and Mayer countered with Interruptions in Political Interviews: A Reply to Beattie. Beattie responded with with Interruptions in Political Interviews: The Debate Ends? Bull and Mayer, four years later, published a study called How Not to Answer Questions in Political Interviews. Then the conversation dwindled. But Beattie did not shy away from studying interruptive behaviour. He wrote a book called On The Ropes: Boxing as a Way of Life. A reviewer, in the journal Aggressive Behavior, contended that the book is a knuckle-cracking good read, that it &quot;takes you into a world where respect has nothing to do with your publication record or letters after your name, but with your ability to take a punch without letting on that you are hurt. Geoffrey gives a wonderful description of what it is like to be on the receiving end of an accomplished sparring partner.&quot;  Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize",

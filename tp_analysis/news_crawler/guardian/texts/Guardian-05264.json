    "text": "It goes without saying that business schools have an obligation to maintain contact with, and contribute to, practice. This includes producing research that has an impact on the real world - research that cannot separate itself from practice to focus only on theory. The potential to have impact, to change the way people and organisations behave, sets business schools apart. This is what creates value for managers and leaders. However, business schools are seen by some as giving greater priority to theory over applied research and producing findings that are not sufficiently useful to be implemented by managers. From this perspective, faculty members are depicted as theorists who are increasingly detached from the everyday problems of the business world. One way of redressing this is to bring people with business experience onto the teaching staff of business schools. The benefits of doing so are that business people bring a wealth of acumen that adds a competitive edge and enhances the student experience, as they provide students with insight into the realities of the business world. Academics with business experience are also able to engage in research with business relevance  translating theory into practice. Academics with real-world experience also help to strengthen relationships with the business community, which can lead to opportunities such as action research projects. Such reciprocal learning and knowledge transfer partnerships lead to shared benefits to organisations and academia. Yet there are challenges to business people entering the academic world. They often have no academic credentials, so the lack of academic work is a key barrier. They might be leaders in their own field but if they move into academia they have to start from the beginning and work their way up, the slow academic progression ladder. Frequently this means that their business experience and knowledge is not considered for promotion opportunities, only the articles they publish. The FME (Foundation for Management Education) has, until recently, offered business leaders a bridge to move from industry into academia. The FME has provided training fellowships and development programmes as well as initial funding for new research initiatives. As someone who was fortunate to be given an FME fellowship six years ago, which was partly sponsored by Sage, the business software company, I was able to join the academic world after 20 years of working in companies across the globe. The fellowship enabled me to carry out longitudinal research with a multi-national enterprise, which has since influenced the business model of the company. Sadly, due to a lack of funding the FME is about to close its doors  cutting off a key route for the career transition of business people who are passionate about moving into the academic world. Each month I, and other FME fellows, are approached by someone interested in moving from the business to the academic world. These individuals are often passionate about teaching and research and willing to have a massive cut in salary in order to contribute to the education of individuals. With the demise of the FME there are few routes now available to them. If you ask an MBA student what is more important to them  someone with a huge back catalogue of scholarly articles or someone with hands-on, real-life, relevant experience, it is likely they will choose the latter. This is not to decry the rigor of academic excellence which is vital on an MBA programme and others business school programmes. High quality, peer-reviewed research, structured analysis, and academic debate are a key part of an MBA, but this should not be instead of business experience. For surely these academics with business experience are well placed to provide research that has an impact on the real-world, with their experience of having worked in it. In today&apos;s competitive, complex global business environment, business schools need to find ways of attracting emerging talent onto programmes in more creative and opportunistic ways. Visiting professorships, mentoring schemes, and consultancy projects are just some of the ways in which we can ensure we involve managers and leaders within an MBA programme. These initiatives of course depend on strong, familiar links to the global business community, and therefore we must engage with the community as never before, if we want to be seen as truly relevant to the real world of business.

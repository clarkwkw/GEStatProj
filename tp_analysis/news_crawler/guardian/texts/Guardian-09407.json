    "text": "Today is Blog Action Day, an annual event that aims to unite the world&apos;s bloggers by asking them to post about the same issue on the same day to raise awareness and trigger global discussion. The topic for 2012 is &apos;the power of we&apos;. A common prejudice around blogging and social media is that it&apos;s all about &apos;me&apos;. Critics often dismiss blogs either as narcissistic (&quot;we&apos;re not interested in that discussion now; been there, done that&quot;) or as so-called echo-chambers. On the contrary, I would argue that blogging and social media empower the individual to have a voice and that this voice only becomes meaningful when it addresses, listens to and engages with others. I have blogged before about finding Twitter a unique tool for engagement while completing my PhD. More recent phenomena, such as the #tweetyourthesis tag, remind PhD students they are not alone in their often isolated scholarly life. On the Networked Researcher site, Julio Peironcely also wrote about how blogging and social media can help PhD students fight loneliness. On the other hand, there is Jean Paul Sartre&apos;s belief that hell is other people. In academic life (as in other professional paths), collective work can often take longer or become more complicated than one would personally wish. At a time when there are more post PhD graduates than paid jobs for existing PhDs, and in a profession that correlates traditional notions of originality with hierarchical authority or reputation, collaboration might seem counterintuitive  an obstacle to individual success. As technologies that enable collective and remote collaboration, blogging and social media often clash with paradigms of individual success and privilege (by definition, privilege depends on the lack of privilege of others). But for me, blogging&apos;s innate &apos;power of we&apos; is synonymous with collegiality  the cooperative relationship between colleagues. Blogging and social media in higher education and academic research offer plenty of examples of successful and positive collective action. Projects such as the University of Venus, Transcribe Bentham, HASTAC, 4Humanities and Digital Humanities Now are evidence that scholars are happy to experiment with, and redefine, paradigms of scholarly communication, authority and originality. Academics are collaborating remotely via these spaces, often across different time zones and often in spite of difficult personal and institutional circumstances in which digital scholarship is still not officially recognised or rewarded. Instead of seeing an academic colleague as a potential professional competitor, threat or even enemy, the power of we in academia means seeing them as potential collaborator and even friend. Blogging means believing, sometimes against discouraging evidence, that there&apos;s strength in numbers, and that collective intelligence and collaboration are quickly becoming the default mode of 21st century research.

    "text": "The games industry owes a significant debt to the Alien movies. Given the widespread co-opting of its source material, Colonial Marines faced a monumental task in attempting to be both fresh and faithful to the film. It has met the challenge with some success. Antiseptic human environments clash with grotesque alien hives in a flawless recreation of the franchise&apos;s look. The pacing of quiet moments between firefights is terrific, every hissing vent and whirring fan inducing a twitchy triggerfinger. Mostly, the story is solid,too, with a littering of wider universe locations, collectibles and references to please die-hard fans. What&apos;s galling is that it all sits atop a substandard shooter. Tactical play amounts to firing as many bullets at bad things as possible, which never feels like a challenge given the amount of ammunition available. Worse, human enemies seem little smarter than their mindless alien counterparts, while dodgy textures and glitchy physics abound. Ultimately, Colonial Marines is redeemed by its connection to a beloved franchise, but anyone seeking more substantial gameplay would do better looking at one of the titles that honours the series&apos; influence, if not the name.",

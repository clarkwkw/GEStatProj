    "text": "Left literally heartless but somehow alive in the wake of a dragon&apos;s attack on your village, Dragon&apos;s Dogma sees players set off to not only reclaim their vital organ but perhaps to save the world en route. So far, so Skyrim  but Capcom&apos;s new game only bears surface similarities to Bethesda&apos;s fantasy opus. Branching quests and ridiculously customisable characters certainly make their appearance here, but there&apos;s none of the stat-grinding tedium. Instead, hardy combat is the focus, with a class system allowing you to blend melee, magic and ranged attacks as you progress. The standout feature, though, is the pawn system, where support characters are shared online when you&apos;re away, returning with spoils of war. You can hire additional pawns from a global pool to bolster your own party too. It&apos;s a fantastic system that brings a fresh level of interaction to single-player gaming, and makes Dragon&apos;s Dogma a unique offering from Japan&apos;s otherwise play-it-safe developers.",

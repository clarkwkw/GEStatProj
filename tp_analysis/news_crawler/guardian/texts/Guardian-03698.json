    "text": "      Wouldn&apos;t you love to go on a behind-the-scenes tour of the Big Bone Room at the American Museum of Natural History? In this video, Paleontology Collections Manager Carl Mehling shows us a few fossil treasures, such as the bony beak of a triceratops, the original model of T. rex, which was used to figure out how to mount the real specimen, and one of the largest intact dinosaur bones in the world, the 650-pound thigh bone of the long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur Camarasaurus.           The largest terrestrial dinosaurs ever known are part of a group known as the sauropods, a word that means &quot;lizard footed&quot;. Even the smaller representatives of this group were the largest animals in their habitats. Sauropods are the most recognizable groups of the dinosaurs, having long necks and tails, small heads in comparison to the rest of their body, and thick, pillar-like legs. These animals, which were herbivorous, also had a number of unusual anatomical features, such as a system of air sacs inside their vertebrae and pneumatic, hollow bones -- a feature shared with birds.  Why did sauropods grow so large? The environment played a powerful role in their evolution. During the Late Jurassic, much of the land was covered with savanna, which resembled the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores, such as elephants are found. This lends support to the idea that poor-quality food in arid environments promotes the evolution of giant herbivores since large body size aids efficient processing of food. After large body size evolved, other (secondary) life history benefits that accompany large body size also became apparent; relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span were the most secondary advantages. Here&apos;s Carl Mehling showing us the Big Bone Room:            [video link]. More than 3 million specimens make up AMNH&apos;s world-class paleontology collections, but only 0.02 percent of the vertebrate paleontology specimens are on view; the rest are stored behind the scenes, where they continue to be studied by Museum scientists and their colleagues from around the world.

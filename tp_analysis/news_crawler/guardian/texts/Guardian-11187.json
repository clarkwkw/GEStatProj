    "text": "Halfway up the mountainside, beyond the terraced rows of miners&apos; cottages, the heavy graves of the great and good were sinking. The cemetery was littered with shattered tombs  toppled headstones, granite plinths dislodged and foxhole-sized caverns opened up in front of near indecipherable inscriptions. Memorials were given touches of plastic modernity in the yellow warning tape that corralled larger tombs, or looped over the tops of jutting, leaning pillars. Were the miners, whose tunnels below had earned these worthies their funerary wealth, bringing them down to earth? The graves by the boundary wall at the far side were under the spreading branches of oak and ash trees from the adjoining wood. It was here that we came to the scroll tablet belonging to the first person in the valleys to be killed by a motor car. We lightly brushed off lichen-frilled twigs and a mush of leaves from the flat rectangle of his tomb. A hundred years ago, John Ogwen Jones was just seven years old when he ran in front of the chauffeur-driven car of the mine owner&apos;s son. His little sister  my wife&apos;s grandmother  swinging on a gate, saw it happen, though her abiding memory was of the blackberry pie that she had been promised but never got for tea that day. The mourners must have stood under the biggest of the oaks, a younger version of its now ancient self, perhaps without the thick north-facing cladding of moss, and ferns sprouting from a fork in the branches. They would have heard the little stream gushing immediately behind the wall. And the high, bright sounds of small birds would have rung out then as they did today. Blue tits chirruped and played tag from tree to tree, long-tailed tits passed overhead in a tinkling procession and three nuthatches  miners with beaks  shimmied up and down the trunks, probing the bark, giving &quot;quick, quick&quot; calls in excited intakes of breath. My eyes flitted again and again between the stillness of the graveyard and the clamouring in the wood, over a wall that separated but did not divide the two worlds.",

    "text": "     THQ has produced some nicely ominous teasers for its forthcoming Darksiders sequel, and here is the latest. In &apos;Death Eternal&apos;. a montage of battle scenes and famous paintings is used to introduce the new lead charachter, Death, whose story runs alongside War&apos;s adventures in the original title.  We&apos;re expecting some more hacking and slashing, with a modified version of the first game&apos;s excellent weapons and character customisation system, lots of apocalyptic scenery and plenty of gigantic monster battles. For now, we can enjoy Death cropping up, Zelig-like, in works by Paul Nash, Francis Bacon and others.  Darksiders II is released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 this summer.",

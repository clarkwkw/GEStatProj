AcerCloud announced in Las Vegas &gt;&gt; Gadget Writing Tim Anderson: &quot;One of the features, which failed in the CES demo, is that a PC which is in hibernation can be woken up through wi-fi to deliver your content on demand: &quot;As long as the main PC is in sleep (standby/hibernation) mode, Acer Always Connect technology can wake it up through Wi-Fi so media can be retrieved via a mobile device. &quot;This whole thing would work better if the cloud, rather than the home PC, were the central repository of data. A PC or notebook sitting at home is unreliable. It has a frail hard drive. It might be a laptop on battery power, and the battery might expire. The home broadband connection might fail - and most home connections are much slower uploading to the internet than downloading from it. &quot;Another question: if you one of the professionals Acer refers to, will you want to put your faith in AcerCloud for showing documents at your business meeting?&quot; The Next Big Thing: Android in the home, and in the fridge &gt;&gt; CNET Blogs &quot;The smartphone will become the portal to other devices and appliances in the home, which will all work together seamlessly and allow access to whatever type of information you want anywhere in the house.

Apple CEO Tim Cook didn&apos;t really make $378 million in 2011 &gt;&gt; Fortune Tech Cook&apos;s basic salary was an agreeable $900,000 last year. He was awarded $376m in restricted stock units which, according to Fortune, depend on Cook&apos;s continued employment at Apple over the next 10 years. Twitter orchestrates music partnerships with Gracenote and The Echo Nest &gt;&gt; guardian.co.uk &quot;This partnership means Verified Twitter Accounts can be distributed into a wide range of products and brands - from smart TVs and automotive infotainment systems to cloud music services and smartphones,&quot; says Gracenote president Stephen White. Got that? Verified accounts only.

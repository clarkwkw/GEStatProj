    "text": "   Julienne Lusenge Photograph: J Rand/Julienne Lusenge    There are small signs of positive change as survivors are now more willing to seek services, [and] families no longer reject them, but rather accompany survivors of rape as they seek help. Certain police officers, judges, lawyers and traditional leaders are getting engaged in our struggle. We have won more than 500 court cases, with some of the perpetrators in prison. Unfortunately, the majority sooner or later evade prison  and justice  due to corruption in the system. But people are more and more aware that laws exist to punish sexual violence as a crime. We have a national action plan to tackle gender violence, and survivors are overcoming their trauma in order to help others. However, we still have a long way to go. Men play a very important role in ending the violence. Politicians, first of all, need the political will to implement legislation  [also] military leaders  some have been involved in stopping soldiers who commit the crimes, but many others continue to let it happen or commit rape themselves. Ordinary citizens, whether trained or untrained, they help us in mediating the reintegration of survivors into their families, they raise awareness about gender violence, and they document the cases and send them to our offices. However, the [number of] men who are actively engaged to stop rape remains low. The number of civilian assailants has been increasing as a result of militias disbanding and officials being sent home to their communities without adequate psychological preparation. In this way, evil takes root in our society. Women are coming together in organisations to support and accompany survivors. Sometimes they come together, even when they don&apos;t have the means, but they are determined. They have actively participated in drafting legal texts and advocating for the law to be applied. The women at the grassroots level are raising awareness among communities, traditional leaders and local leaders to prevent stigmatisation of the victims. The government must put into effect the national action plan against gender violence. It must apply the law and facilitate women&apos;s access to justice by reducing the costs for women to take perpetrators to court, as well as fund victim compensation. They can also give grants to organisations so we can continue to work at the grassroots level on education initiatives. Armed conflict has exacerbated sexual violence that existed in our traditional society. The crime of rape impacts on young women and girls the most, with the consequences of this violence weighing heavily on society: trauma, sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, mutilation of sexual organs and genitals, deformations, mental illness, fear and community conflicts. These consequences hinder the economic development of our country, as women, who would be working towards development, are left traumatised.",

    "text": "An unexpectedly popular release in 2011, followed by a sequel that improved on the original, Activision&apos;s Skylanders showed that a game aimed at children but made with the depth and sophistication of its adult contemporaries could be commercially effective. The toy-game crossover is adored by kids  6.2m of the Skylanders figures were sold in the UK last year  and parents will know how strongly the concept of seeing the toys come to life on screen appeals to children&apos;s imaginations. The latest iteration, Swap Force (out this autumn), on its first public airing looks unlikely to see a drop in youthful enthusiasm. The &quot;swap&quot; of the title allows the top and bottom halves of the figures to be interchanged to create new powers that can be used in unique ways within the game. This feature will have immediate appeal, encouraging experimentation in what is already an imaginative title. The mixing and matching is a clever and fun dynamic that works well physically with the toys and in the game as both a means to progress and for the simple pleasure of just seeing what happens. Sixteen new Swap Force Skylanders will be released and, if all are collected (with a spot of parental largesse), will boast 256 different combinations. The game will also support all previous characters, although the technology of the interchangeable toys will require a new Portal of Power  the interactive hardware between toy and console  to operate. David Nathanielsz, executive producer of the game for developer Vicarious Visions, explains the thinking behind the game&apos;s new direction. &quot;The Swap Force characters came out of that desire to make sure the toy experience was new and fresh for kids,&quot; he says. &quot;So that not only when you play the video game but also when you&apos;re in your bedroom and you&apos;re just playing with the toys, you can have new interaction  you can mix and match and have imaginative play with the toy outside of the video game. But then, when you get out the Portal of Power and you play, there is also innovation in the game.&quot; The brand has been a resounding success for Activision, reportedly generating $1bn for the company between its launch in October 2011 and February 2013. But aside from the obvious commercial appeal of creating new characters, there is also some genuinely innovative thought here, specifically aimed at what appeals to young, exploratory minds. It&apos;s a far cry from the usual sequel trick of changing the colour scheme of the environment and bolting on a few new powers. But then Activision isn&apos;t afraid of doing things differently. The publisher was already bucking the industry trend by creating a children&apos;s game at a time when the smart money was heading elsewhere. Eric Hirshberg, Activision&apos;s CEO, believes it was a brave decision but one vindicated by the unique appeal of the game. &quot;All the obstacles on paper would have guided you to not make it,&quot; he says. &quot;It was a kids&apos; game, the Wii was in decline, other companies were getting out of kids&apos; games, toy manufacturing was not our core competency And a three-year development time for a children&apos;s game  that was very unusual. But we knew we had something magic. I&apos;ve yet to meet the kid who sees a toy come to life in our game and whose eyes don&apos;t pop out of their head.&quot; That sort of reaction in play-testing vindicated Activison&apos;s decision long before the game itself became a hit, and the resulting toy-game crossover has become an example of the blurring of boundaries in entertainment media. &quot;Look at Skylanders, just as a toy line, outselling Transformers and Star Wars toys,&quot; says Hirshberg. &quot;That&apos;s pretty remarkable. Kids today are not growing up thinking of the differences between movies and games  games are just part of their daily lives and how they consume entertainment.&quot; Hirshberg will, of course, be cheered that they have chosen to do so in the case of Skylanders in such large numbers. Yet it would be churlish in this climate to deny the spoils to a publisher that has been willing to take a chance and then see it through with such care and attention. Activison will expect similar success with what looks to be an equally well-worked sequel later this year.",

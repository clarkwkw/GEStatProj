    "text": "Can numbers be narcissistic? As a matter of fact, yes they can be.    What is a narcissistic number? It is a number that is the sum of its own digits when each digit is raised to the power of the number of digits. For example; 407 is a number with three digits, so when we apply the rule to this number, we get: 407 = 43 + 03 + 73 = 64 + 0 + 343 There are 88 narcissistic numbers in total, and the largest one has 39 digits.

    "text": "The latest Sims 3 add-on, like the others, has been carefully crafted to find new ways to micromanage your time and befuddle your senses. The basic virtual dollhouse formula is unchanged but Showtime adds a new hood, new bling and a supposedly new incentive to play  namely, discovering your inner diva. As always, you start by creating characters, finding accommodation and decking out them out with old and new items  of which there are more than250. Starlight Shore is a smallish new town, but comes complete with a bohemian beachfront area and plenty of inspirational housing to move into once you start making money. You&apos;ll also notice a bevy of performance venues, from small clubs and bars where you perform for tips to arenas that you can pack with paying customers once your skills improve. Sims vets will quickly plough into the minutiae of making friends, money and opportunities. However, what will strike you from the outset is Showtime&apos;s big new idea  Social Networking. Social Networking can be found in the top right of the screen as a pop-up window where players post memories, achievements, messages or friend requests. You can control who sends these messages to a certain extent, creating a constant visual chatter that you can tune into or out of at will. Old timers might find this distracting or even annoying, but I&apos;m guessing the Sims&apos; younger audience will love it. Perhaps less successful is the SimPort. This is basically an extension of the game&apos;s IM feature, allowing you to pack your character off to another player&apos;s game for an impromptu gig. They return with shared experiences and memories but little else  drawing attention to the fact that what this feature really lacks is a picture-in-picture display of your Sim being cheered or heckled by your so-called friends. This was probably too technically demanding for a mere add-on, but without it SimPort feels like a good idea waiting to be better implemented. So what of these new careers? Well, for the first time, Sim jobs are more than just a featureless means to making money  these are proper interactive pursuits that you are supposed to invest time in improving. You can choose between Singer, Acrobat, Magician and DJ  although the latter is a moonlighting career that any profession can try. I&apos;m guessing most players will try the Singer first, armed with only a couple of cheesy tracks and a poor sing-o-gram business. As your reputation grows (and this applies to all three new careers) you can start requesting auditions for bigger gigs or showing up at SimFests; public talent contests with cash prizes. Each of the eight career levels adds more tracks, tricks and props to your repertoire. There are also new Wishes, Skills and three new character Traits too; natural born performer, social butterfly and diva. Fans of quirky characters, after the previous appearance of Vampires, can also look forward to a Genie granting them three wishes (including the ability to return from the dead) once the dusty lamp has been purchased from the Lifetime Rewards catalogue.     The Sims 3 Showtime  Katy Perry    So yes, Showtime has more of everything you&apos;d expect but what it&apos;s really crying out for are some diva performances. I know it&apos;s a Sims game, so recycled moves and gobbledygook lyrics are perhaps to be expected, but surely they could have splashed out on better backing tracks? Even the Katy Perry limited edition, which you&apos;d expect to be jam-packed with hits, only has a few fashion items and a poster. As for the DJ, there are some decent genres to mix (including Dubstep) but nothing you&apos;ll be tempted to crank up the volume for. Things do improve a bit if you choose to be an Acrobat or Magician, who at least can draw on better props as they move to bigger venues. It&apos;s not exactly Cirque du Soleil, but it&apos;s a lot better than sitting through endless karaoke gibberish from the singers. For dedicated fans of the series, Showtime is a worthy add-on, chock full of new diversions and clearly on a mission to take its audience out of the bedroom and into the wider world. In fact, between social networking and SimPort, if you were looking for a clue as to the future direction of the franchise, look no further. However, if it was hoping to keep reality TV fans tuned in, what it really needed was some Guitar Hero swagger.  Game reviewed on PC",

    "text": "In terms of output, Queensland University&apos;s pitch drop study  the world&apos;s oldest laboratory experiment  has been stunningly low. Only eight drops have emerged from the lump of pitch installed in the university&apos;s physics building foyer in 1927. Watching paint dry looks exhilarating by comparison. But excitement is now rising over the experiment, which was set up to calculate the viscosity of the world&apos;s stickiest substance, pitch, which has been found to be at least 230 billion times more viscous than water. According to Professor John Mainstone, who has run the experiment since the 1960s, a ninth drop looks set to emerge from the pitch block in the very near future. &quot;No one has actually seen a drop emerge, so it is getting quite nervy round here,&quot; said Mainstone. &quot;The other eight drops happened while people had their backs turned. For the last drop, in 2000, we had a webcam trained on the experiment, but it broke down  in 1988, when the previous drop was about to emerge, I popped out for a coffee and missed it.&quot; The fact that pitch  which is so brittle it can be smashed with a hammer  behaves like a fluid is the most surprising aspect of the experiment, added Mainstone. &quot;This time we have got several cameras trained on the pitch sample to make sure we get a sight of it dropping. It will take only about a tenth of a second, however. On the other hand, I am 78, and the next drop is unlikely to fall for at least another 10 years, so this might be my last chance to see it happen.&quot; Mainstone will share the experience with people who watch the unmoving lump of pitch on computers around the world  in the hope they will catch the moment when the Queensland experiment actually produces a result.",

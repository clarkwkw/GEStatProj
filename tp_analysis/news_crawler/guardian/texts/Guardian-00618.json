Tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday we will be running live Q&amp;As with teachers, lecturers and experts from technology companies such as Google and Microsoft. The first Q&amp;A will take place tomorrow from 12-2pm featuring Steve Beswick of Microsoft and Martin Harvey of e-skills UK  click here from tomorrow morning to read it and take part. We want teachers, students, lecturers, developers and IT professionals to give their views on the teaching of IT and computer science. What is going wrong  and what can we do to improve the situation? Throughout the week, in the paper and online, we will be looking at how employers feel about the scarcity of digital skills among the UK workforce, going to schools to talk to them about how they teach IT and computer science, hearing from ministers such as Michael Gove and Ed Vaizey and visiting the Bett education technology show in London. The campaign is supported by Google. Click here for full coverage later today and for our first live blog tomorrow morning.",

    "text": "A commitment to work with academics and students in two areas ravaged by war marks out Salford University&apos;s approach to its international strategy.  Supporting the rebuilding of infrastructure and expertise in Iraq meant experts from Salford and the University of Basra leading a collaboration between their institutions, local authorities in Iraq, international oil and gas companies, and their supply chain that resulted in the creation of the multi-disciplinary educational and research centre, the Basra Centre for Development and Innovation.  In Sri Lanka, the university&apos;s longstanding relationship with the country spanning over two decades was critical in helping build the trust required for Salford&apos;s academics to support the rebuilding of culturally diverse and traumatised communities physically, socially and economically. &quot;Salford sees investment internationally in terms of sustainable reciprocity and mutual learning and does not view countries simply as a source of potential student, business or research income,&quot; says Professor Mustafa Alshawi, who led the Iraq project.  &quot;All Salford&apos;s work internationally is based on the principles of two-way collaboration and respect. Students from Salford swap places with those internationally, ensuring that learning can be jointly developed, shared and brought back into students&apos; home countries and beyond. Projects are developed across disciplines and with cultural sensitivity, underpinned by a humanitarian set of values.&quot;",

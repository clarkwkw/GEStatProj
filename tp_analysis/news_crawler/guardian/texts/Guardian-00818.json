    "headline": "Competing for AAB students: open season on university places begins", 
    "text": "Each August the &apos;Glorious 12th&apos; marks the start of the shooting season when grouse moors across Scotland, Wales and the north of England shudder to the sound of gunfire. This Sunday 15 January is the closing date for UCAS applications and so sees the first day of a new open season  on students predicted to get at least two As and a B in their A levels. The government has decided to exclude these students from number controls on university places  so universities can recruit as many of them as they can or want. As is usual in such contests, success favours those with the greatest armoury, so those with the most prestigious brands, who already take more than three quarters of their intake from the small AAB pool, will be best placed. They include Oxford and Cambridge, of course, but also Exeter, Durham, Bristol, UCL and Warwick. These universities turn hundreds of excellent AAB students away each year and could easily admit more. The key question is how much these universities will use their advantage to increase their intake of AAB students. Oxford and Cambridge have no desire to expand, but behind the scenes, others have been preparing to increase their AAB intake by as much as a tenth. This Sunday will bring the expansionists out into the open. Growth at the top of the league table for academic entry will mean those in the middle and at the bottom face a grim struggle to hold on to the high-performing students they already have. These include Russell Group universities such as Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle, with 50% or less of their intakes in the AAB group. They are particularly exposed, because although the proportions are relatively small, the numbers are large. Manchester, Nottingham and Leeds have more than 2,000 AAB students who are now off quota and have to be competed for. The institutions most at risk of losing students who&apos;ve done best in their A-levels are those in the bottom quarter of the league table for academic entry. They often have a hundred or more AAB students each year. These are often students who&apos;ve actively rejected more elite universities for reasons of culture, geography or course, but this surely will be the richest hunting ground for academic expansionists touting generous merit-based bursaries. The HE White paper promised to extend off-quota recruitment, over time, to students with lower A-level grades, or equivalent. It says: &quot;AAB will represent a starting point, but our ambition is to widen the threshold over this parliament, ensuring that the share of places liberated from number controls altogether rises year on year.&quot; The coming months will see intense lobbying on this issue. There is concern that expanding off-quota recruitment to ABB students in 2013 will destabilise a system already reeling from the pace of change. But there is a great deal of shameless self interest in the outcome. Those who already recruit the most AAB students  particularly the ambitious ones who want to use their advantage to improve their position further, are quite content to leave the threshold where it is for a while. For those a bit further down, expanding off-quota recruitment down the grade scale is a matter of desperate urgency. What is interesting is that the Russell and 1994 groups contain institutions in both camps, creating a bit of a lobbying conundrum, whatever their public positions. The ideology driving the off-quota policy is the government&apos;s desire to create a true free market in HE, where money follows the student. Some senior Conservatives would like to make all places contestable so long as students have achieved the minimum requirement of two Es at A-level or their equivalent. But the treasury would never accept this because it has the potential to hugely increase the number of people going to university and would put an unbearable strain on the student loan system. This is because as you go down the A-level grade scale, more and more vocational, technical and other qualifications are counted as equivalents. The only reason that the Treasury allowed David Willetts to make AAB students off quota at a time of deficit reduction was that there are very few other qualifications that are equivalent to A-level performance at that level, so the bean counters could be fairly confident that the numbers wouldn&apos;t go above the 65,000 budgeted for. In the end, it could be this cash consideration rather than any lobbying by universities or the ideological desire of ministers to create an HE market, that drives the decision on when and by how far off-quota recruitment is expanded.

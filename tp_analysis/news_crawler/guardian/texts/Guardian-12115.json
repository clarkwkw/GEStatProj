    "text": "The British company TweetDeck Ltd, which was bought by Twitter so it could gain control of the multi-column app for viewing the social networking site, will soon cease to exist as an independent entity after Companies House moved to strike it off its register. But the app itself will continue as part of Twitter itself, which now owns the intellectual property and employs the staff who had been working on the product. TweetDeck, the company, became one of the iconic names for the regrowth of the UK&apos;s technology industry focussed on social media in locations around London&apos;s Old Street  an area later dubbed Silicon Roundabout. The letter from Companies House, first highlighted by Sky News, said the company will be struck off in three months and forcibly dissolved unless it files accounts. Those were due in September. That follows a statutory warning earlier this month from Companies House, which regulates the activities of all companies registered in the UK, that TweetDeck could be struck off because it had not filed accounts for the year ending March 2011. TweetDeck, set up in 2008 by Iain Dodsworth, was bought in May 2011 by Twitter for a rumoured $40m, apparently to head off competition from would-be advertising sellers on the network. The closure of TweetDeck Ltd would have no effect on Twitter or TweetDeck, the app, because the assets of the UK company have been acquired by the larger US company.",

    "text": "David Cameron does indeed have a chance to act on global malnutrition thisweek at the G8 summit (Wood shavings for dinner: G8 urged to tackle scourge of malnutrition, 17 May). However, millions will continue to die or suffer chronic malnourishment unless he and other world leaders stop giving financial and political support for the failed industrialised food system that has exacerbated hunger and environmental degradation. Barack Obama&apos;s plan for private-sector investment will bring scant comfort to our Mozambican partner, the national farmers&apos; movement, Unio Nacional de Camponeses. Recent drives by Mozambique&apos;s government and World Bank policies to encourage private investment have lifted investors&apos; rights above those of rural people. Moreover, private rural investment in many developing countries has not beenshown to decrease poverty levels. On the contrary, this approach has encouraged land grabs, production of food and biofuels for export, as well as exploitation of workers, and worsened small-scale farmers&apos; livelihoods. Cameron, Obama and their counterparts must drop the failed model of foodsecurity for food sovereignty, which requires agrarian reform in favourof small producers and the landless, and the reorganisation of global food trade to prioritise local markets and self-sufficiency. It also demands tougher curbs on global food chain firms, such as supermarkets, and the democratisation of international financial institutions. The right to food is a human right, not a welfare issue.Graciela RomeroInternational programmes director, War on Want",

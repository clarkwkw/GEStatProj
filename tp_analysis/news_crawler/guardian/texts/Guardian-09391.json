    "text": "I&apos;ve always imagined that my graduation ceremony will be like a small-scale version of my future wedding day. The prep, the invitations, the gifts  and most importantly, the outfit. The ensemble must perfectly complement the colours on the gown I&apos;m getting ahead of myself, I&apos;ll admit it: graduation is a Marmite subject. Some of my fellow students can&apos;t see the significance in what they believe is as an outdated, lacklustre ceremony. Others are blas at the best of times. But there are those, such as myself, for whom graduation was a blindingly bright light at the end of a dark dissertation tunnel. It offered some comfort during the weeks spent hidden away from the world by a towering pile of books in the university library. Graduations take place across the calendar, with many universities opting for a winter ceremony. But what advice do recent graduates have for those who are preparing for their ceremony this season? Kate Corbett-Winder, who graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2008, thinks introductions between your family and your friends&apos; parents can get the day off to a good start. &quot;We all met at the clock tower in the university grounds and did mass introductions of friends and teachers my parents had heard me speak of but never met.&quot; For those who live away from home while studying, university can create two separate lives. On the one hand, the uni bubble, filled with new friends and study, and then home  where all your important mail still goes and where the fridge is always full. Merging these two worlds can be a really special moment. Like most student traditions, alcohol features throughout the day, and it can be tempting to get carried away, especially when in a celebratory mood. &quot;Have a big lunch before celebrations,&quot; advises psychology graduate Jade Van Loo, 25, &quot;because most likely you&apos;ll be drinking from then on.&quot; She tells me to allow proud and eager parents to have their moment too  which means preparing for lots of embarrassing photos. Fleur Britten, author of Debrett&apos;s Etiquette for Girls, has some useful advice for a difficult issue that can threaten to ruin many students&apos; graduations  separated parents. &quot;Don&apos;t, as some do, shun your graduation altogether because you can&apos;t face the fallout,&quot; she insists. &quot;Tell both parties that the other will be present and depending on their current relationship, either divide your post-graduation time fairly between them or arrange a joint meal.&quot; Having a neat exit plan in case things go awry, she adds, might also be a good idea. But what should you wear? A smart blouse and skirt combo for girls and a dark suit or tux for the boys seem to be the most common response from the graduates I asked. Although you may have plans for fancy clothes, Anglia Ruskin graduate Firoozeh Daraei, 24, warns &quot;you don&apos;t want to spend your day adjusting your dress.&quot; A shirt with a button to secure your graduation hood is a good idea, as is, Fleur recommends, carrying some safety pins and brooches to secure your gown. She also advises students to choose a shirt of a heavier fabric since gowns can be very heavy  &quot;or else you&apos;ll find your blouse attempting to strangle you&quot;. The cost of graduations is another unnerving element of the ceremony. The total price varies between universities, but with tickets, gown hire and photographs it can all amount to a rather tidy sum  in my case, four tickets for family members and gown hire will set me back 144. The day is special, but don&apos;t strive to go beyond your means. Kate tells me one of the highlights of her day was when she, a group of her closest university friends and their parents went for a low-key but relaxed lunch at their favourite local pub  a meal that brought many happy memories but didn&apos;t break the bank. Jim McClellan  who, as head of the BA Journalism course at the University of Westminster, is well practised at the graduation circuit  says have fun, and follow others if you&apos;re not sure what to do during the ceremony. &quot;Don&apos;t wear too much as you can easily overheat under your gown, relax, participate and cheer your fellow classmates  and don&apos;t try and high five the chancellor, I think someone tried that one year and it all got very confusing.&quot; Despite all the arrangements, worries and stress there is one key piece of advice to remember. As Oxford graduate Jaimin Allen, 27, says: &quot;Enjoy it! It&apos;s once in a lifetime. Just make sure you are looking sharp as these photos will probably be on your parents and grandparents mantel piece and be admired by everyone.&quot;",

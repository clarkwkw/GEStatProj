    "text": "It is shocking that Amazon is paying no UK tax on the profits from its massive sales here (Report, 5 April). Many other retail companies also pay ludicrously low amounts of corporation tax. Retail operations can&apos;t move overseas, like manufacturing industry can, so it is really just a lack of political will that stops Revenue and Customs from taking action. They could estimate what the real profits on UK sales are (as they sometimes do for small cash-based businesses), and tax the companies accordingly. The real question is why governments don&apos;t do this, since it would painlessly raise billions of pounds and be very popular. Could it be that both Labour and the Conservatives are afraid to upset big companies because they are too dependent on corporate donations? Richard MountfordHildenborough, Kent  While your readers are digesting the obscurities of Amazon&apos;s tax affairs, they may like to contemplate that Amazon obliges most publishers, especially the smaller ones, to let them have 60% discount on the proposed publisher&apos;s retail price. Thus, for a 20 book, the publisher, with all of its expenses, will get only 8, out of which the author will generally receive 80p. There&apos;s good business for you. No wonder proper bookshops close.John RichardsonLondon  So, Britain&apos;s largest online retailer paid nothing on its profits last year. This gives new meaning to its parent company&apos;s slogan &quot; And you&apos;re done&quot;. Murray WorthySenior economic justice campaigner, Waron Want",

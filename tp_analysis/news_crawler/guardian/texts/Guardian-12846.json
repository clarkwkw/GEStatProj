    "text": "A new survey indicates that 45% of Britons are willing to admit they have used their mobile  or even email  to communicate with someone who is in the next room. The gradual acceptance of habits that were once considered unforgivable requires continual updating of the relevant etiquette. Obviously procedures will evolve over time, but here are some basic rules of engagement to get started. It is OK to ring someone who is in another room in the same house provided that person is:a) Not answering your shrieks.b) At least one flight of stairs below or above you.c) Refusing to respond to repeated Facebook updates, or direct tweets. It is not OK if:a) You can hear each other&apos;s voices clearly through the wall.b) You are simply using the mobile ringtone to locate a child.c) The answer to your stupid question can be Googled just as quickly.d) You are ringing from the loo.  For conversations likely to last longer than a minute, the mobile call should be used only to make an appointment to meet face-to-face at a convenient mid-point in the home.  Room-to-room mobile calling dispenses with most formalities associated with telephone exchanges. It is, for example, permissible to begin the conversation by saying &quot;What?&quot;  Remember: when both of you are at home, you can&apos;t pretend you&apos;re not available. If the otherperson can hear your phone ringing, you must either answer or be trapped under something. Five acceptable room-to-room emails:1) &quot;Is the printer on?&quot;2) &quot;Is there paper in the printer?&quot;3) &quot;I thought you would like this [INSERT YOUTUBE LINK]&quot;4) &quot;Do we need one of these? [INSERT LAKELAND CATALOGUE LINK]&quot;5) &quot;Did my thing print OK?&quot; Five unacceptable room-to-room emails:1) &quot;Is it just me, or is the magic gone?&quot;2) &quot;Do you smell burning?&quot;3) &quot;Can you ring my phone? I can&apos;t find it and I need to speak with you.&quot;4) &quot;Don&apos;t call me now!!! He&apos;s in the other room!!!!&quot;5) &quot;Ignore that last email  it wasn&apos;t meant for you.&quot;",

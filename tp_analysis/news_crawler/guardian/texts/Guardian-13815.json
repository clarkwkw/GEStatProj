    "text": "Despite it being a full 10 years since Luigi last donned his custom vacuum cleaner and captured ghosts in a haunted mansion, the overdue arrival of Luigi&apos;s Mansion 2 was well worth the wait. The sequel still sees the world&apos;s second most famous plumber suck up ghouls, which remains a satisfying gameplay feature. But this is a longer adventure, with five mansions riddled with secrets and puzzles to explore, and each of them has been split into bite-sized missions, which is ideal for on-the-go gaming. The controls can be fiddly and the otherwise superb visuals look pixelated on the 3DS XL, but nevertheless, this is a deep, charming adventure, with superb audio and challenging puzzles. An essential purchase for Nintendo fans.",

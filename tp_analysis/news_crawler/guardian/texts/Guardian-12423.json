    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view When the skeletal remains of General Akamoto make it to the afterlife, he&apos;s enraged to discover that there&apos;s a queue to get in. Even in death, the noble general does what he must: recruits a platoon of cadaverous samurai and starts slicing his way to instant justice via a series of turn-based encounters in which you use scenery to bolster your defences, chow down on the skulls of fallen enemies to inherit a little of their power, and haunt rice paddies and shrines to recruit new undead allies. Each level forms a discrete challenge, with strictly finite availability of reinforcements and an interesting terrain feature or special set of foes to distract you, which along with its ever-cheery humour manages to keep things fresh. It&apos;s not perfect, a particular faux pas being the inability to distinguish between troops, but it&apos;s genuinely interesting, challenging tactical jollity.",

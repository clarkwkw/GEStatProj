    "text": "Our email inboxes here at Gamesblog are deluged daily with press releases and PR stunts to promote games. And, being the hard-nosed, cynical journalists that we are, those emails usually end up in the bin in about 10 seconds flat. But sometimes, just sometimes, along comes a PR stunt that&apos;s just too cute to bin. Or ignore. This is one of those times. A PR agency sent us the image above of the Lego mini-figures lining up outside the GAME store on Oxford Street in London to buy themselves copies of Lego Batman 2 at midnight last Thursday, and for once we really could not resist. As you can see. But it does raise some questions. Why did Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern and the rest have to line up to buy a game that they star in? Surely the distributor, Warner Bros Interactive, could have easily slung each of them a free copy? Who was protecting the world from villainy while the heroes were all standing in line to buy a video game? And finally, how did they manage to elude the street sweepers? Of course, it should come as no surprise that Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes has gone straight to No 1 on the game chart. And that Guardian reviewer Nick Cowen calls it &quot;easily the best Lego game we&apos;ve seen in years&quot;. Developer Traveller&apos;s Tales has, for many years, been making these brilliant, fun, playable  and yes, cute  Lego games beloved by kids and adults alike.  OK, that&apos;s more than enough cuteness (and PR puffery) for one day. We&apos;ll be back to our normal, cynical selves tomorrow. Promise.",

    "text": "My brother, Peter Jackson, has died aged 57 of complications following heart surgery. For many years, he was a freelance journalist at the forefront of the microcomputer revolution, explaining the new technology in simple and clear prose for the Guardian, the Times and many other publications. Peter was born in Eccles, Greater Manchester. He went to Eccles grammar school and studied physics and electronics at Lancaster University. In 1984, as editor of the journal MicroScope, he won the prize for computer journal of the year at the Computer Press awards. The following year, he won the award again  this time as editor of Personal Computer World, which the judges praised for its &quot;lively writing and design style&quot;. He always preferred writing to editing and moved on to PC Magazine, becoming an editorial fellow along with their other star columnist Guy Kewney. Peter was joint winner, along with Steve Malone, of the UK Press Gazette Business Press award for columnist of the year. The magazine was taken over by VNU in 2000 and Peter, along with many other staff members, was made redundant at the end of that year. In recent years, Peter had a number of serious health problems. He moved to Brighton in 2007 and became reclusive, but colleagues and friends remember him with great affection for his phenomenal intelligence and his ability to understand complex subjects and take the time to explain them with clarity and wit. They also remember his encyclopedic brain, which led to him being banned from pub quiz teams as there was no point in competing against him. He is survived by his daughter, Rosie, his former wife, Annie, his partner, Carolyn, and me.",

    "text": "Two areas in Gloucestershire and Somerset have been selected to pilot a badger cull in the autumn, the government announced on Thursday. During the six-week trials in the two areas, chosen from a shortlist proposed by the farming industry, selected farmers and landowners will be allowed to shoot badgers. The first site is mainly in the district of west Somerset and partly in Taunton Deane; the second is mainly within the Forest of Dean and Tewkesbury, and partly in the districts of Wychavon, Malvern Hills and west Gloucestershire. The measures are part of efforts to tackle tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, which minsters claim will cost taxpayers around 1bn over the next 10 years if not dealt with effectively. The pilot, which will be paid for by farmers, will test how safe, humane and effective the &quot;controlled shooting&quot; of badgers is, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said, and if successful could lead to a wider cull of badgers. Farmers and the government believe a cull is necessary to tackle the disease but proposals to kill badgers - which are a protected species - face strong opposition from animal welfare and wildlife groups. Agriculture minister, Jim Paice, said: &quot;Bovine TB is a chronic and devastating disease. It causes the slaughter of tens of thousands of cattle each year, and is taking a terrible toll on our farmers and rural communities. &quot;Nobody wants to cull badgers. But no country in the world where wildlife carries TB has eradicated the disease in cattle without tackling it in wildlife too. &quot;These two pilots are just part of a wide range of activity on bovine TB. We already have robust measures to control its spread amongst cattle, which we plan to strengthen further, and are continuing to work hard on the development of practical and usable vaccines.&quot; The announcement was immediately criticised by Labour and welfare groups. Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, said: &quot;For a cull to work it has to be cost-effective, humane and reduce bovine TB. &quot;The government&apos;s plans will achieve none of those things. This big society badger cull will cost farmers more than it saves them, put a huge strain on police, and will spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers move out of cull areas.&quot; The animal welfare group Humane Society International/UK warned there was a risk that local badger clans could be completely eradicated in the chosen areas by &quot;farmers with guns and a grudge&quot;. Mark Jones, the group&apos;s executive director, said: &quot;Now that we know the likely location of the pilot culls, Defra&apos;s persecution plan for badgers is becoming alarmingly real. &quot;Without knowing how many badgers there are to start with, there is a high risk that badgers in these areas could be wiped out completely. Some of these badger clans have existed for centuries, but farmers with guns and a grudge could very well shoot them out of existence.&quot; The group pointed out there would be no pilot cull in Devon &quot;despite it being a major bovine TB hotspot&quot;. It said: &quot;The culls will begin in the late summer, after the London Olympics. HSI UK believes this scheduling is because the government is anxious to avoid a PR disaster and to ensure sufficient police will be available to deal with any protests trying to prevent the shooting.&quot; In the Commons, Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy said there was &quot;widespread opposition in the south west to badger culls taking place within local communities&quot;. She asked the agriculture minister, Jim Paice: &quot;Now that the two pilot areas have been announced, what steps will the minister be taking to consult with local people?&quot; Paice said that when farmers applied for a licence to shoot badgers, Natural England would consult with local people before granting permission. David Bowles, director of communications at the RSPCA, said the animal welfare charity was &quot;devastated&quot;. He said: &quot;This cull will be of little help in reducing the disease and could actually make things worse in some areas. It will wipe out huge numbers of this much-loved species, virtually eliminating badgers from these areas, including many animals which are healthy.&quot; He called for the government to focus its attention on being able to deliver a vaccination strategy rather than culling badgers. Farmers and landowners in the pilot areas in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset will be able to apply for licences to Natural England, with their application judged against a series of &quot;strict criteria&quot; before the licence is granted. The criteria include:  The individuals taking part must be able to demonstrate a high level of competence in marksmanship, and then successfully complete a government approved training course.  All participating farmers must comply with all the government&apos;s TB cattle controls.  Biosecurity measures to minimise the spread of bovine TB between cattle, and minimise badgers interacting with cattle, must be implemented by participating farmers.  There must be a high incidence of TB already present in cattle and the area must be at least 150 km sq with access to at least 70% of it.  Participants must take reasonable measures to mitigate the risk of badgers with TB relocating or spreading bovine TB to areas surrounding the culled area. These could include natural barriers that help stop the movement of badgers  such as coastline, rivers and major roads  or vaccination of badgers in the surrounding areas before the pilots begin. The two police forces that cover the trial areas, Avon and Somerset and Gloucestershire, will begin planning how to keep those involved in the cull and protesters against it apart. One senior police source said: &quot;We have already been in talks with the home office and Defra to make sure we get this right. It is always a particular challenge to police often quite remote rural areas. We will certainly have to make sure we get our resources right.&quot;  There was a mixed reaction from farmers in the south west. Ian Johnson, the region&apos;s spokesperson for the farmers&apos; union, the NFU, said: &quot;Culling the badgers is not something any farmer particularly wants but it is an appropriate and necessary measure.  &quot;I know one farmer whose cattle were infected with TB and he had to have them all slaughtered. A vet told him the same would happen if he had more cattle so he is now a chicken farmer.  &quot;There is no other way to combat the disease without culling. It will be done professionally and humanely and overseen by an independent panel of experts. It is not a case of trigger-happy farmers going out and killing the badgers.  &quot;Farmers know it is a sensitive area and they don&apos;t want badgers treated inhumanely, they just want to get rid of the disease. It is a brave decision by the government.&quot;  Somerset farmer, Derek Mead, agreed action had to be taken. He said: &quot;It is about time something is done as it is costing hundreds of millions and farmers are committing suicide as a result. But as a farmer and countryman I&apos;m sceptical of the plans and won&apos;t be happy to see healthy badgers killed. &quot;There are other ways to identify the infected sets before culling them, but they aren&apos;t being listened to because they aren&apos;t coming from scientists.  &quot;We also think the most humane way for culling the diseased badgers is by gassing their setts with carbon monoxide. We just think the cull could be done more efficiently and humanely without seeing healthy badgers annihilated.&quot;   Get the Guardian&apos;s environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+  This article was amended on 20 January 2011 to give the correct title for the Humane Society International/UK.",

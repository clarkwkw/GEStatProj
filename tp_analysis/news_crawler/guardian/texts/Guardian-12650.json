    "text": "It&apos;s another grey, bitingly cold morning. Two donkeys stand head down in the road, one on each side. They are immovable and every vehicle has to weave between them. A few hundred metres up the hill, in front of the pub, 15 donkeys are lined up along the car park rail, as though waiting for opening time. In summer, both scenes would bring a smile and no doubt would be attended by tourists busy with their cameras. Today, the animals look sorry for themselves. Their coats are still very wet following the heavy rains over the weekend. One gorse tangled in its hair, a sign perhaps that they spent the night sheltering among the bushes on the common. As I watch, a couple come over to sniff me, hoping I&apos;ve got some food. They pause for a while after they see my empty hands and then, heads down, turn back to join the others again. Winter can be tough for all the larger animals in the forest but it can be specially so for donkeys. Ponies are well equipped to cope with the climate. Their coat has an outer dressing that throws off the bulk of the rain, beneath which are fine, warm hairs that protect against cold. The problem for them is not winter weather but pestilential flies in summer. Donkeys originate from more arid parts of the world where water-proofing is not required. When a donkey gets caught in the rain, there&apos;s nothing to stop it getting soaked. They&apos;re ideally suited to get their living from the forest but, when wet, can look the most miserable creatures. Come summer, and everything will be different. The group will split up and spread through the lanes. Some will enjoy the shade outside the village school, forcing the head teacher to close her windows to keep the air inside as fresh as possible. Others, particularly the foals, will find a warm spot on the tarmac, as like as not in that suntrap just where the road bends sharply, and settle down for a sleep that not even slapping the side of the car will disturb.",

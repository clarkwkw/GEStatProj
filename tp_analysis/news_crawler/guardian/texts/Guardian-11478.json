    "text": "Think of wild berries at Christmas and bright red holly usually comes to mind, but another symbol of the season is the bluey-grey berry of the juniper tree, and which has a fascinating use. Gin owes its distinctive taste and aroma to flavouring from juniper berries  in fact, the word gin comes from either genivre or jenever, the French and Dutch words for juniper. And the mature berries also make a good flavouring for venison and game. The juniper tree is well adapted to cold weather, and was one of the first trees to colonise Britain after the last ice age 10,000 years ago. It is a conifer tree with spiky leaf needles, a type of cypress closely related to one of the most controversial trees in the UK  the Leyland cypress, also known as leylandii, which grows so fast and tall it quickly blocks out views in people&apos;s gardens and has led to umpteen disputes between neighbours. The juniper used to be common in Britain but has steadily declined over the past few decades, largely as a result of grazing. And because its wood burns with little smoke it was also a favourite fuel for illegal distillers, and great tracts of juniper were once harvested for fuel. But now the juniper is coming under a new threat from a fungus-like disease recently discovered attacking specimens of the tree in Scotland and England. The disease is fatal, and it is feared could eventually wipe out the tree across Britain.",

    "text": "It&apos;s time for our weekly roundup of new games for smartphones and tablets, this time covering iOS, Android and Windows Phone. The week&apos;s pick of new and notable games includes board and letter games, fashion retail, racing, flinging potatoes, managing Arsenal and the return of an 80s icon, He-Man. Carcassonne With plenty of fans on other platforms, board game Carcassonne has made the leap to Windows Phone, courtesy of Microsoft Studios. It sees you placing tiles with roads, fields, cities and other features, while trying to dominate your opponents. Xbox functionality is included.Windows Phone Letterpress: Word Game Developer Atebits is best known as the firm behind Twitter app Tweetie, which was acquired by Twitter a couple of years ago and used as the basis for its official iOS app. Now the developer is back on its own two feet with Letterpress, a well-designed twist on Boggle&apos;s find-words-in-a-grid-of-letters formula, including Words With Friends-style turn-based play against friends.iPhone / iPad He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe Quite a claim, even if it is riffing off the original cartoon show&apos;s slogan. If The Smurfs could become a lucrative hit on iOS in 2011, what price He-Man in 2012? This action game sees you battling the likes of Beast Man and Skeletor across 27 levels, with in-app purchases included to upgrade He-Man&apos;s power.iPhone / iPad Ayakashi: Ghost Guild Zynga is getting into the card-battling genre of mobile games, which has previously been dominated by publishers from Japan like DeNA and Gree. This game, which has just been released globally, takes a fantasy RPG setting, as you build a deck of digital cards to battle ghosts and other players alike.Android / iPhone Pocket Clothier It&apos;s been out on Android for a while, but Japanese publisher Kairosoft&apos;s fashion-retail sim is now available on iOS too. It has all the trademark features of the company&apos;s previous games (Game Dev Story, Dungeon Village etc), as you turn a small shop into a bustling &quot;super-brand&quot;.iPhone / iPad Beach Buggy Blitz This has also been out for a while on Android, so why include it again? Until now, it&apos;s been restricted to devices with Tegra processors, but now developer Vector Unit has opened it up to others, including Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S III. As before, it&apos;s a bouncy beach-racer with impressive graphics and a free-to-play business model.Android Arsenal Fantasy Manager 2013 It&apos;s safe to say there are a few Arsenal fans wishing they had control of the club&apos;s transfer policy and team selection right now. Developer From The Bench&apos;s new mobile game may ease their frustrations a little bit. It puts you in charge of the club, with players&apos; skills depending on their performance in real-life games. Oh...Android / iPhone / iPad Punch Quest Rocketcat Games won lots of fans with its Mage Gauntlet game for iOS. This follow-up looks equally fun: an &quot;arcade-style fighting game, entirely controlled by taps with your left and right thumbs&quot;. Which is basically an excuse for an array of dungeon-based punchupery, with monsters.iPhone / iPad PotaToss Funded on Kickstarter, this is a bit like Angry Birds, except with the birds and pigs replaced by... potatoes. Yes. The twist is its location-based levels: depending where you are in the world, you&apos;ll see a backdrop based on your nearest big city. Which may sound a bit gimmicky, but the game is good fun.iPhone / iPad Contract Killer 2 Glu Mobile&apos;s freemium long-range-shoot-em-up has spawned a sequel, which sees you roaming the world conducting more hit-jobs on unsuspecting foes. Well, unsuspecting if you do it right. The gameplay is a mixture of sniping and close-quarters combat, with lots of upgrades available, buoyed by in-app purchases.Android / iPhone / iPad Zombiewood There are easily enough zombie-themed games on the App Store to form a huge, shambling horde to take over the world now. Zombiewood is the latest, although it comes from a proven source: Gameloft. The plot sees zombies invading the streets of Los Angeles (insert own &quot;how would anyone tell?&quot; joke here), with the gameplay being dual-stick shooting as you try to clear them off.iPhone / iPad Crossword Dungeon Fantasy dungeon-crawling and popular-with-pensioners word gaming... Together at last! Yes, Crossword Dungeon is an unholy blend of adventuring and puzzling, but it might just work a treat. It sees you questing through a dungeon where &quot;every level is made up of a procedurally-generated crossword, and each letter guarded by a vile monster&quot;. Guessing letters right kills the beasts, with endearing pixel-art graphics adding to the charm.iPhone Cricket Captain 2012 App Store reviewer BarnetOscar has already nailed this one: &quot;Good if you want a football manager for cricket. In fact you&apos;ll have no other option.&quot; But yes, this sees you in charge of a cricket team (English, Australian or Indian), with a database of more than 4,000 real players, and a mixture of strategy and contractual negotiations.iPhone / iPad Penny Arcades On The Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 Long title, strong game. Based on the existing Steam and Xbox game, this sees you exploring a 16-bit adventure featuring &quot;A cunning evil Doctor, a series of Unexplainable Thefts, a Mysterious Book of Power and Enigmatic Supernatural Forces&quot;. Also unexplained capital letters. Still, it&apos;s a well-crafted labour of love. The link above is for Android, but here&apos;s the iOS version.Android / iPhone / iPad Quest &amp; Sorcery Skyfall 2012 has seen rich pickings for fans of RPG games on the App Store, with Mobage&apos;s Quest &amp; Sorcery the latest to strap on its sword and go looking for monsters and loot. It includes a mixture of solo and co-operative missions, as you explore a world that the developers promise will be &quot;ever-evolving&quot;.iPhone / iPad Twist Pilot British studio Crash Lab signed on with Zynga to publish this puzzle-action game, which is also part of Sony&apos;s PlayStation Mobile initiative. It sees you guiding a little chap named Phil through 72 levels trying not to touch the sides, with nefarious spiders trying to impede him as he goes. Quirky, and very fun.Android / iPhone / iPad Arel Wars 2 Korean publisher Gamevil has brought its latest tower-defence sequel from Android to iOS, as you muster your troops to protect your castle over eight worlds, each with 15 stages to conquer (or avoid being conquered, given the genre). Battling other players is part of the fun too.iPhone / iPad Shardlands Shardlands is picking up a fair amount of buzz this week, and rightfully so: its blend of action-adventuring, puzzles and &quot;big scary monsters&quot; is a treat, with graphics well worth showing off on your device. With 20 levels, there&apos;s plenty of brain-bending in store too.iPhone / iPad Royal Revolt! This is the latest &quot;reverse tower-defence&quot; game, which means that rather than fending off hordes of onrushing enemies, you&apos;re playing the enemies. Who are now the heroes, I guess. Anyway, it&apos;s very good, with spiffing graphics, 30 castles to conquer, and a medieval setting.Android Mirrors of Albion HD Hidden object games should be massively popular on iPad, but they don&apos;t seem to have quite taken off as much as you&apos;d think. Maybe Mirrors of Albion can help change that. Released by Game Insight, it&apos;s set in &quot;a mystical version of Victorian England&quot; where Sherlock Holmes meets Alice in Wonderland. As ever, you&apos;re looking for objects hidden in plain view in a variety of locations.iPad That&apos;s our selection, but what are you playing this week on your smartphone or tablet?

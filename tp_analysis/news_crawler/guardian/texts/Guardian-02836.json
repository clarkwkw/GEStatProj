    "text": "Lambs turn their faces to the world. They are so achingly young and yet their attention is already shifting from the ewes. They look into the grass of the old pasture that&apos;s known so many of them over the years. Centuries of lambs have spent their first days here, and many their last, too. Every year the same thing happens: scrappy little woollies become individuals: looking, feeding, springing, playing, running between their mothers and their peers; forming bonds, developing trust, gaining confidence. They turn their faces from the ewes to the grass, and even though they can&apos;t eat it yet they must see the green world shaped for and by them. They see the bumblebees banging around and collapsing because it&apos;s not yet warm enough and there&apos;s not enough nectar around to sustain flight. They see birds on the fence: robins puffed-up and pugilist, splay-tailed blackbirds sunbathing, irascible when disturbed. They see rooks, crows and ravens insouciantly strut across the field, and are unaware of their darker intentions. They must see above them jackdaws flying in and out, round about the tallest lime tree in the field when they strike their hooves against its root buttresses in a ritual which is centuries old. Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred birds: charcoal grey, blue-eyed, swaying like waves, calling sharp as stick whacks inthe last burst of March sunlight before dusk. Across the fence wire and the hedge and the lane and the fold of hills, the year teeters on the balance of equal day, equal night, the spring equinox. The lambs will not know how vulnerable they are and how we and this land will betray them. For now, each sudden arrival of things, each experience bouncing in from the unknown, becomes part of their flesh and its growing. The lambs turn their faces to the world and a freedom without knowing.",

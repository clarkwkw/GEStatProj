    "text": "Lights, camera, action  entries for the Very Short Film competition are now open. Produce a 60-second film on a subject of your choice and you could win 9,000 towards your education, courtesy of Guardian Students and the Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press (OUP). You can base the film on any subject  it might be a personal interest or something that relates to your study. But just like the books in the Very Short Introduction series, you&apos;ll need to show that you can convey complex ideas in a short amount of time.  Successful entrants will be on top of their subject, giving an interesting angle, not just a set of facts  and they&apos;ll present them with verve and passion. Whether it&apos;s eighteenth-century poetry or elephant conservation, we want to see that you can fire up an audience&apos;s curiosity about your subject, and that you&apos;re creative. The best submissions will be featured on the Guardian website this autumn. The deadline for entries is 31 December 2012, after this we&apos;ll draw up a longlist of the best videos to open up to a public vote. A panel of media, journalism and publishing experts will then select a winner from the four most popular clips. The winner will receive a cash prize of 9,000 to pay towards their university fees and/or student living costs, while three runners-up will get 250s worth of OUP books. The competition is open to any UK student who is enrolled on a full-time, fee-paying higher or further education course (or equivalent in Scotland), and to any UK school student who is applying for a place on a fee-paying higher or further education course in autumn 2013.

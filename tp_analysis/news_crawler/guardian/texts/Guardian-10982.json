    "text": "Anne Karpf says she feels confused and helpless in the face of climate change (You can&apos;t ignore this, 1 December), andseems inclined to blame herself for this. But in a week when we have yet another apocalyptic warning about unsustainability (World &apos;on collision course with nature&apos;, OECD green growthreport warns, 4 December), while the chancellor gets set to authorise up to 40 more gas-fired power stations (Osborne&apos;s gas plan will harm economy, says energy adviser, 5 December), who could reasonably be blamed for feeling confused and/or powerless? Meanwhile the international climate change talks meander pointlessly on, radiating an eerie feeling that their processes were actually designed to achieve stasis. Even this paper&apos;s green guru George Monbiot has despaired (Now we know. Governments have given up on the planet, 26 June). Worse still, the only coherent mechanism for addressing the problem  contraction and convergence  remains mostly shunned by the powers that be and reviled by the major environmental non-governmental organisations. It&apos;s too late now, anyway. Confused? Understandably. Powerless? Undeniably.Dave BradneyLlanrhystud, Ceredigion  Your article on the chancellor&apos;s gas strategy is right to highlight the risks to the UK&apos;s carbon targets resulting from his plans for gas expansion. However, there is another option to the scenario presented by Damian Carrington. The expansion of &quot;green gas&quot; would allow the chancellor to align his plans for gas expansion without becoming dependent on expensive, subsidised, controversial and unproven shale gas exploration or on foreign gas for our energy security. There may be a need for gas, in preference to coal, in our energy mix but this does not have to come from expensive fossil fuels. Substitute natural gas can be created directly fromabundant commercial and municipal waste and other biomasssources for injection into the national grid. This is a viable, efficient and green alternative.Rolf SteinChief executive, Advanced Plasma Power",

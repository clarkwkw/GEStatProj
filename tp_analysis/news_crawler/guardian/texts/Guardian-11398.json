    "text": "Wikipedia&apos;s data on the most viewed pages of the year throws up some surprises, not least that web users are still confusing web searches with web addresses. Facebook came out top on the most viewed English-language pages with more than 32.6m views, while Wiki (we assume people were Googling for Wikipedia) came second at 29.6m and Google ninth with 18.5m.  The not-slightly unnerving &apos;Deaths in 2012&apos; was the third most viewed page with 25.4m while the reassuringly normal &apos;One Direction&apos; (big both in the US as well as the UK) was fourth at 22.4m. Films the Dark Knight Rises and Hunger Games also made the top ten with 18.8m and 18.4m respectively. Toolserver, a wing of Wikimedia Germany has more if you have an appetite for scanning top Wikipedia pages from China, Bulgaria and more. 1. Facebook 32,647,9422. Wiki 29,613,7593.

    "text": "On his death at the age of 96, the US inventor Eugene Polley has received the accolade he wanted most: to be recognised as the father of the TV remote control. As he told the Baltimore Sun in November 2000: &quot;Itmakes me think maybe my life wasn&apos;t wasted. Maybe I did something for humanity  like the guy who invented the flush toilet.&quot;     Eugene Polley's natural aptitudes took him along way. Photograph: AP    Polley&apos;s problem was that his invention, the raygun-like Flash-Matic remote control, was quickly superseded by a more popular device, the Space Command, which was developed byRobert Adler, his colleague at what was then Zenith Radio Corp. This led to Adler becoming known as the father ofthe remote control, though as Polley observed: &quot;A father has to be present atconception. And if you&apos;re not, you&apos;re not the father.&quot; Adler had, in fact, developed the first TV remote control, Lazy Bones, which Zenith introduced in 1950. This was acontroller on the end of a long wire, which meant people could trip over it. Zenith&apos;s president, Eugene FMcDonald, wanted a wireless version, and Polley came up with the Flash-Matic. This was, essentially, a hi-tech torch. Users pointed it at four photocells positioned next to the corners of the TV screen totrigger actions. They could turn the TV on and off, move to the next or previous channel, and mute the sound. The Flash-Matic was launched in 1955 and was a great success. However, users could forget which corner performed which action, and their TV could respond erratically to, for example, sunlight through a window. As a result, in 1956 Zenith switched to Adler&apos;s Space Command, which used small metal rods to generate high-frequency sound waves to control the set. Known as &quot;the clicker&quot;, it was used until the early 1980s, when infra-red controls took over. Today&apos;s controllers are much closer to Polley&apos;s idea than to Adler&apos;s.

Adler was a European scientist with a doctorate from the University of Vienna. Polley, anative ofChicago, was a self-taught inventor who worked his way up from amenial job in Zenith&apos;s stockroom in1935. Polley had studied at the City Colleges ofChicago and the Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute ofTechnology). However, he dropped out to take a job because his mother, VeraWachowski, was struggling during the depression. Polley&apos;s father, described as abootlegger, deserted the family when Polley was about 10. Polley&apos;s natural aptitudes took him along way at Zenith. He occupied positions including product engineer, mechanical engineer, head of video recording group and assistant division chief. During the second world war, he worked on bomb fuses and radar while on secondment to the defence department. Later he contributed to the development of push-button radios for cars. In all he earned 18 US patents, while Adler gained 180. Both men retired in 1982, when Polley had worked for Zenith for 47 years. Polley, by then awidower, lived with his daughter, Joan, in acluttered house in Lombard, near Chicago. He always kept an original Flash-Matic to hand. In his later years, Polley felt he did not get enough credit for his invention. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune in 2006, he said: &quot;Not only did I not get credit for doing anything, I got a kick in the rear end.&quot; In fact, he had been awarded a $1,000 bonus. When the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences gave Zenith an Emmy for developing the TV remote control, both Polley and Adler collected it. Polley&apos;s wife, Blanche, to whom he was married for 34 years, died in 1976. Their daughter, Joan, died in 2008. Heissurvived by his son, Eugene, andagrandson, Aaron.

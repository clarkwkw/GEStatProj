    "text": "UN officials estimate more than 20,000 people have fled into the bush after an outbreak of violence between two tribes in Jonglei state in South Sudan over accusations of cattle rustling. Gunmen burned thatched huts and looted two medical facilities run by Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) over the past week during fighting that has left more than 1,000 dead in recent months, and threatened to destabilise the world&apos;s newest state. The UN has rushed troops to Jonglei, an isolated and swampy state with limited mud roads that are often impassable for months during heavy rains. Government officials say army troops are in &quot;full control&quot; of the remote town of Pibor, home to the Murle people, who have been accused by the Lou Nuer tribe of stealing cattle. Lisa Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan, said &quot;probably well over 20,000&quot; people had fled into the bush, &quot;running for their lives and looking for safety&quot;. Officials fear the fighting has left scores of people dead, while the UN has flown wounded people to the capital, Juba. But South Sudan&apos;s information minister, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, was quoted by Agence France-Presse (AFP), as saying that Pibor was &quot;under the full control of the government&quot; and the Lou Nuer had started returning to their homes after having been ordered to do so. &quot;South Sudan is not, and will not become, some kind of Somalia,&quot; he told the French news agency. The fighting has disrupted aid operations in the area, and MSF said it has temporarily suspended medical activities in Pibor county. &quot;Thousands of people have fled for their lives in Lekongole and Pibor in the past week and are now hiding in the bush, frightened for their lives,&quot; said Parthesarathy Rajendran, MSF head of mission in South Sudan on Tuesday. &quot;They fled in haste and have no food or water, some of them doubtless carrying wounds or injuries, and now they are on their own, hiding, beyond the reach of humanitarian assistance.&quot; MSF said the village of Lekongole has been razed to the ground. An MSF team that assessed the situation in Pibor a week ago described it as a ghost town, after virtually everyone fled into the surrounding country. &quot;While the people are hidden in the bush, we cannot reach them to clean and dress wounds, treat diseases and provide general primary healthcare,&quot; said MSF. &quot;The longer they are in the bush, the more serious it will become for people who are injured or sick.&quot; During the violence, two MSF medical facilities were looted and damaged; the clinic in Lekongole and the small hospital in Pibor. MSF advised its 156 locally hired staff to leave their town or village and seek refuge. Although it has established contact with a few of them, many cannot be contacted as they have fled with their families and neighbours. Save the Children said it has lost contact with two of its staff in Pibor. &quot;Up to 25,000 women and children have fled fighting and are hiding in the bush,&quot; said Save the Children. &quot;They are likely to be terrified, and without clean water, shelter or enough food. Many could be injured. Children in the area already live in continual fear of violence and are often abducted in raids. If fighting continues, thousands more could be killed, maimed, abducted or recruited to fight.&quot; The NGO called for calm so its teams can access affected children. The UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan (Unmis) deployed a battalion of troops to Pibor when it appeared to be facing attack by an estimated 6,000 armed men from the Lou Nuer. Lou Nuer fighters raided the town of Lukangol, sending thousands of civilians fleeing towards Pibor last month. Jonglei state has been rocked by reprisal attacks between the two communities, which have a history of animosity over grazing land, water sources and cattle raids during which women and children are often abducted. Unmis has deployed resources to stave off conflict in the Lou Nuer, Murle and Dinka communities, and has also brokered a reconciliation process between various communities, particularly the peace process led by the Sudan Council of Churches.",

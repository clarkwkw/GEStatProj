    "headline": "Oh, no, RIM: Marissa Mayer's husband dumps BlackBerry for iPhone", 
    "text": "Oh dear. Even as Yahoo&apos;s appointment of Marissa Mayer as its chief executive was sending an electric jolt through Silicon Valley on Monday, her husband Zachary Bogue was sending his own sort of jolt in the direction of embattled BlackBerry-maker RIM. Yes, he&apos;s dumping it.    Dear @rim, My Blackberry no longer even functions as a phone. At the Apple store right now. It's not you, it's me. Best, The Last BB User&mdash; Zachary Bogue (@zackbogue) July 16, 2012    Obviously Bogue is his own man in the Mayer-Bogue household; in his day job he&apos;s a cofounder and managing partner of Founders Den, which provides space for &quot;experienced&quot; entrepreneurs. It&apos;s indicative of the problems RIM is having though if it can&apos;t hang on to a business-y user such as Bogue. He is now, it seems, an iPhone user. We&apos;re guessing that Mayer will hang onto her Android phone. As well as her Nest thermostat, Up bracelet by Jawbone (it collects data about your daily activities), Verizon Mi-Fi (for turning a 3G signal into a Wi-Fi network), Google Chromebook (the &quot;cloud-based&quot; computer favoured by Googlers), and Eagle Creek zipper bag.  (How do we know about those? From her Geeksugar interview from December 2011, when she shared her Christmas gift choices.) In the meantime, if anyone has seen any good news for RIM, please could you share it in the comments? We think they need a bit of relief.",

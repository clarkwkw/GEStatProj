    "text": "As the deadline for university applications approaches, many sixth formers will be thinking hard about what to do next year. A university education doesn&apos;t come cheap. Depending on where you study, tuition fees can cost as much as 9k  and this figure doesn&apos;t include the pricey equipment or academic trips students will be asked to fork out for while at university. Living costs are another worry. Termly installments from the Student Loans Company don&apos;t go very far towards student&apos;s basic living expenses, according to NUS research. It estimates that after paying for utilities and rent, the average student will have just 11.15 in student support left to live on each week.

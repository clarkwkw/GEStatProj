    "text": "Boom Brigade was a big success for developers 10tons, so it&apos;s no surprise to see a sequel, Boom Brigade 2 (iOS, App Store, 2.49). The original was a nice twist on route-drawing games such as Flight Control. It required you to draw paths foratrio of tooled-up troopers who march round their bunker, shooting an alien menace. The soldiers fire automatically when in range of enemies, with bazookas,mini-guns and the like, while collecting power-ups to kill the badguys. The sequel manages to maintain the strengths of its predecessor with a few well-needed polishes. The number of troopers you control at any one time has been increased, which could be confusing, but with the tactical mode  where you pause the game then issue instructions tobe carried out when resumed  it is made manageable, allowing for a more strategic battle. There are 30 missions, with five upgradable trooper types, making for a long-lasting challenge that outdoes its popular predecessor in everyrespect. Clumsy Pirates (Android, Google Play, 1.79, Thumbstar), in contrast, is aiming for a younger audience. It&apos;s a puzzle game in which you guide Billy the Mop as he attempts to throw ignited cannon balls overboard before they destroy his ship. There are 96 levels of colourful cartoon mayhem, with various obstacles that must be overcome to reach the exploding projectiles in time, making this a surprisingly challenging title.",

    "text": "When Sardia was just over a year old, her mother Hasina started to notice she was having difficulties walking and picking things up with her hands. &quot;I saw that she wasn&apos;t like the other children,&quot; says Hasina, a mother of three from a small village in the north of Bangladesh. &quot;I watched her and I knew something was wrong, she was walking in a different way to her twin sister and she couldn&apos;t really move her limbs.&quot; Sardia was taken to the local clinic, which referred her to a bigger district hospital. The doctor there told Hasina that he thought her baby had cerebral palsy, but there was nothing that could be done. &quot;I had no idea what he was talking about, I had never heard of cerebral palsy,&quot; says Sardia. &quot;I thought she was going to die.&quot; Conservative estimates show that in a country with a population of more than 161 million, 1-2% of all babies are born with some form of cerebral palsy. Cerebal palsy is a condition that disrupts the nerve signals between the brain and muscles, often leading to problems with movement, posture and co-ordination as children grow up. Research has linked the condition to prolonged, difficult or premature births, where the baby is somehow deprived of oxygen either in the womb or during delivery. The vast majority of babies with cerebral palsy in Bangladesh are born in rural areas. According to Unicef data, 78% of births in the country still take place in the home, where women experiencing complicated or difficult childbirth lack access to trained medical professionals or treatment services. Hasina was lucky enough to find a doctor who diagnosed Sardia early. Two months on, mother and daughter are starting a two-week therapy course at CRP-Bangladesh (Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed). The centre is the only facility in Bangladesh offering any kind of specialised services for children with cerebral palsy and admits 80 children and their mothers every month. Cerebral palsy cannot be cured or even treated, but it can be managed. The centre offers a mix of group sessions, physiotherapy, play and music therapy and education classes for parents; it admits children from three months to 12 years old. &quot;The earlier the children get here, the more we can do for them, the problem is that mothers are so in the dark about cerebral palsy that children often aren&apos;t diagnosed until they are six or seven,&quot; says Hosneara Perveen, who heads the centre&apos;s paediatric unit. Mothers of disabled children still face huge stigma, says Perveen. Many are blamed if their child starts showing signs of disability, such as loss of control of their hands and legs or sudden spasms. This often stop them from seeking help, because they feel ashamed. &quot;It&apos;s the social stigma that has to be tackled,&quot; says Perveen. &quot;The only way to do this is to educate the mothers and parents. When they come to the centre, we sit down with the mothers and explain very clearly what cerebral palsy is, how and why it happens, and what can be done to manage it. With therapy, children can show a marked improvement. There is no reason for them to be excluded or shut out.&quot; For Hasina, understanding cerebral palsy has been transformational. She has been learning forms of play and language therapy to help Sardia and will leave the centre with a physiotherapy programme to try to improve her daughter&apos;s co-ordination and balance. The challenge now is to find a way to provide the same kind of education and physical therapy services to the millions of other children with cerebral palsy across the country. Outreach services are next on the centre&apos;s list. Perveen has already dispatched some of her staff into the field with former patients, after mothers told her their children were being excluded from school. &quot;We know teachers are refusing to let children with cerebral palsy into the classroom, but the Bangladeshi government has made a declaration that every child can access education, so we&apos;re trying to show mothers they must raise their voices if their child is being denied or tell us [so] we can help them. So far, our workers have got seven children back in the classroom.&quot; The centre has also launched its own model &quot;inclusive&quot; school, where children with cerebral palsy and other disabilities study alongside children with no disabilities. &quot;Yes, it is a drop in the ocean, but it&apos;s a start,&quot; says Mohamed Quadin, a research associate who has been helping to design programmes at the centre. &quot;We&apos;re trying to expand as fast as we can and the idea is that if we can prove these services work, then we can try to present it to the government as a model that can and must be replicated.&quot;",

    "text": "Announcing plans to replace GCSEs with new English baccalaureate certificates, the education secretary, Michael Gove, said it was time to restore rigour to our exams. Chris Husbands, director of the Institute of Education &quot;I&apos;m not sure there is any evidence that exams are an improvement device on their own. What improves education is improving teaching and learning. Where exams play a part is the extent to which they provide structures that encourage improved teaching and learning. &quot;It&apos;s really important that we have rigour in our assessment. It&apos;s also really important that we are clear about what rigour means. And rigour means assessing children and young people on the basis of the knowledge, skills and understanding that are going to prepare them for adult life.&quot; Michael Li, year 12 student at Manchester Grammar school  &quot;If you tinker with exams you are not addressing the problem at the heart of education, which is engaging students and making them feel a sense of ownership in what they are learning. You can change the test at the end all you want, but it isn&apos;t going to change the learning process.&quot; David Abulafia, professor of Mediterranean history, University of Cambridge &quot;Education is about excelling and bringing out the best in people, and that sometimes means going up against challenges. Being made to sit for several hours concentrating hard and bringing out what you know  and the process of revising beforehand  is very valuable.&quot; Laura McInerney, a teacher in east London for six years, now doing a PhD in education policy analysis &quot;Would a more rigorous driving test improve drivers? It might, if only because making something more rigorous means the average person will need to learn more. But if you are a very bad driver and someone makes the driving test harder it doesn&apos;t make you a better driver. So, will some people end up knowing more stuff? Yes. Does it mean allpeople will know more? No.&quot; Andrew Old, secondary school teacher and blogger &quot;It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for improving the system. Grade inflation, dumbed-down exams and coursework have enabled many people to build a career, particularly in senior management, by playing the game, without doing anything of genuine educational value.

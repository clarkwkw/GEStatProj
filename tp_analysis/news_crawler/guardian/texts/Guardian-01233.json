    "text": "Climate change sceptics have acquired a new explanation for why glaciers are retreating: it&apos;s not global warming, it&apos;s theft. Police in Chile have arrested a man on suspicion of stealing five tonnes of ice from the Jorge Montt glacier in the Patagonia region to sell as designer ice cubes in bars and restaurants. Local media reported that last Friday police intercepted a refrigerated truck with an estimated 3,900 worth of illicit ice allegedly bound for whiskies, rums and cocktails in the capital Santiago. Authorities have accused the driver of theft and are considering adding violation of national monuments to the charge sheet. Scientists say Jorge Montt, part of the Bernardo O&apos;Higgins national park, is retreating by half a mile a year, making it one of the world&apos;s fastest shrinking glaciers. Environmentalists have cited it as evidence that man-made climate change is warming the planet. Sceptics have cited other explanations for retreating glaciers, but theft  until now  was not one of them. It may be the only case in which both sides agree human activity was to blame.",

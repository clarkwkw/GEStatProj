    "text": "JV: John Vidal CdA: Catarina de Albuquerque TU: Timeyin Uwejamomere PG: Dr Peter Gleick TM: Thierry Mallet  A barrel of oil in the ground somewhere, that has a value, but it seems like a barrel of water in the ground somewhere has no value   People think about water as a finite resource when it is in fact finite. So if you think of Arizona, if you think of California in the United States, you think of parts of India, you think of, of course, some of the Arab countries  it&apos;s a real issue. But as long as water&apos;s considered infinite, and I don&apos;t care where it comes from as long as I have it in my shower, then nobody&apos;s going to be willing to pay the prices that are needed to get the finance in to refurbish and renew the sector   The people came together, they organised themselves and they decided to set up a system that would provide water service to them. They owned that water utility, so it wasn&apos;t even the government, it wasn&apos;t even the local government, it was the people themselves. This sort of public participation has been increasing on a day to day basis  JV Hello and welcome to the Guardian&apos;s Global development podcast. I&apos;m John Vidal and this month we&apos;re looking at water, or the lack of it. We can all see the droughts, heatwaves and floods are affecting more and more countries but how can the 2 billion people who already live in water-scarce places respond? Should water be privatised and handed over to giant corporations; or is it best left in public hands? What seems very certain is that with 1.1 billion people lacking access to safe water, another billion people undernourished, and 2 billion extra people forecast to be living within 30 or so years, demand for water resources will rise dramatically over the next decades. Today we discuss what we can do about provision before it&apos;s too late. With me today I have three guests with very different perspectives on the challenges; I&apos;ll introduce them in a moment. But first this week I talk to one of the world&apos;s foremost experts on water, Dr Peter Gleick, who founded the Pacific Institute in California. I began by asking him about the state of world water and how it will affect global development. PG Well the world&apos;s water is in a mixed state I would say; it partly depends on where you were born or where you live. But the bad news I guess is that there are plenty of parts of the world where we have still, despite the fact that it&apos;s the 21st century, failed to meet basic human needs for safe water and sanitation. There are billions of people who don&apos;t have access to the sort of water services that most of us in the developed richer world take for granted every day, and that&apos;s a very serious problem. We also have problems with water quality around the world, with water conflicts, and increasingly with the risks of climate change affecting where we get water, how much water we get, risk of extreme events and all of the complications that climate change will bring. JV How far do you think water or access to water will actually determine development, especially for poor countries over the next 20-30 years? PG I think it&apos;s a key element. If you don&apos;t have access to safe water, if you don&apos;t have access to sanitation, it&apos;s pretty hard to say that you have the fundamentals necessary for getting out of poverty. In many parts of the world there are too many young women, or small children, who spend their lives fetching water and they&apos;re not going to school and they don&apos;t have other opportunities. And so access to safe water and sanitation is pretty much a fundamental determinant, if you will, of the future of a family or the future of a community. JV And we&apos;re seeing conflict over water sort of escalate more and more, we&apos;re not talking about water war necessarily  sort of physical water wars, but throughout India, Nepal, Bangladesh, the Middle East we&apos;re seeing conflict over water. Is that going to get worse do you think over the next few years? PG Well I do think it&apos;s going to get worse. One of the things that we do at the Pacific Institute is we maintain a chronology, we call it the Water Conflict Chronology, which is a list of conflicts over water, violence over water, going back thousands of years. And one of the things we&apos;ve noticed is that it appears that in the last several decades there&apos;s been an increase in violence over water  and not violence between nations so much; at the national level we have diplomats and we have international treaties and we have mechanisms for dealing country to country mostly, with conflicts over water. But we&apos;re seeing a growing number of violent conflicts between sub-national parties, between ethnic groups, between farmers and pastoralists, between farmers and cities. And I&apos;m worried that those conflicts are going to get worse as populations grow, as demands for scarce water resources grow and we don&apos;t really have the approaches for reducing those risks. JV Is human rights and water, are they linked up? PG I think there is a human right to water. There was a long, long debate, multi-decade long debate in the United Nations about whether there was a formal human right to water. And in 2010 the general assembly and then the UN human rights council itself passed binding resolutions declaring a human right to water. So in law there is, I believe, a human right to water. I think the challenge is going to be to get governments to implement it, to protect the human right to water, to ensure that the poorest populations have access to the safe water and sanitation services that they don&apos;t currently have access to. So there is a human right to water. It conflicts to some degree with the economic aspects of water and the need to price water properly. But you cannot deny water for political reasons; I think that&apos;s pretty clear. JV Well that was Peter Gleick. With me to explore all these interlinked political, social and geographical issues I&apos;m joined in the studio by Timeyin Uwejamomere, who&apos;s a technical support manager with WaterAid here in London. And in Paris by Thierry Mallet, who&apos;s a senior executive and vice-president of international at Suez Environmental; and down the line from Switzerland, Catarina de Albuquerque who&apos;s the UN special rapporteur on the human right to water and sanitation. Thank you all for coming. Let&apos;s start with something we can all agree on  more definitely needs to be done to secure water supplies for everyone, and fast. So, Catarina the millennium development goal [MDG] deadline is 2015; what actually happens after that? CdA Well after that I think we already started thinking about what will the new global development agenda look like after 2015. And I think that even though progress has been made and, as you might know, the water-related target has been met five years ahead of time in 2010. The truth is that, as Peter was saying, it&apos;s not enough. It&apos;s not enough because water quality is not measured currently. We have huge inequality. So what I think is that in order to make sure that the human right to water and also to sanitation which has been recognised by the UN in 2010, to make sure that they become reality. I think that we have to embed the new development agenda with human rights concerns. And when I say human rights concerns I mean that the new goals have to look at how to make sure that we reduce inequalities because that is the true blind spot of the MDGs. Even if many countries are even managing to achieve the water or the sanitation target, the truth is that there are systematically patterns of exclusion inside countries that have not diminished over the past 15 years  sometimes on the contrary they have deepened themselves. So the new agenda has to look  Countries are already looking at it, are already giving thoughts to it and the new agenda has to imperatively look at that and include an obligation to reduce inequalities, ensure safety, also ensure [availability] of water, ensure access with a reasonable distance etc. JV Thank you. Thierry, we asked readers on theguardian.com to contribute some of their questions and this one comes from Danny Heim, and so he asked regarding water do we have any sort of plan that seeks to bring people, citizens, in line with the concept of co-operation? Or are we just hoping that folks will get it and co-operate because it&apos;s a good thing to do? I guess what he&apos;s saying is can we just leave it to the market? Is the market going to be enough to get us out of this crisis? TM The point of view of Suez Environnement, first of all, we consider that the fact that the right to water was recognised by the United Nations is a big step forward because we&apos;ve been sustaining that position from the start. The water for us is a public good and it&apos;s a matter of public policy always. And as a private company we are looking at helping public authorities to achieve their goals. We will not substitute public authorities in what they have to do. For instance, in the contract we manage the pricing, access to water is always decided by the public authorities and not by us. And we are trying to contribute to achieve those goals by participating and I could give a few examples. Especially because there is two different matters; there is the physical access to water which is one, and the quality of water and which is the affordability matter as well, is the fact there is no exclusion from water. If I look at what we are doing in those two fields, for instance, in physical access to water I mean we&apos;ve been helping the local authorities in Nigeria, in Algiers especially, to achieve having water 24/7 for 100% of the population. When we arrived five years ago we started with the local authorities, with the local organisation providing them with tools, with technology transfer, with support in order to achieve helping them making the right investment in order to achieve that goal. That typically is the type of objective we have. We never decided on the price of water which was decided by the local government but we did support them on the technical side. JV But nevertheless, Thierry, if I understand it Suez and most of the other large water companies have had to, if you like, to change their tunes. Back 10 years ago/15 years ago you were urging complete privatisation of water supplies in many developing countries. This was basically rejected and you&apos;ve had to change your whole model do I understand? TM We never really advocated full privatisation you know. What we were looking for, it was a concession model by which we would invest and we would recoup the investment we were going to make over the life of the contract and the pricing was always decided by the local government and the quality of service as well. It&apos;s true that this model is probably moving into a model which is different today with more collaboration. What we are doing today is more [a] type of contract where the local authorities is directly deciding together with us on a daily basis; which is a little different from the past where people wanted us to take care of the problem and not looking into how it would be done. And clearly, today because water is probably becoming more and more of an issue than it was 10 years ago, it&apos;s more a shared governance where we bring the knowledge, where we bring the knowhow and we are working together finding solutions. JV Thierry, I&apos;ll stop you there for a moment, but let&apos;s bring in Timeyin. You&apos;re working with a charity basically; what model do you find works best to get water to people? TU Thank you very much John. I think that for us in water what we&apos;ve learnt over the years is that co-operation is very useful. And it&apos;s very important that this year the global community is celebrating the World Water Day based on the theme of co-operation. We found that working with the local people, working with the municipality, working with the state or central governments and all the development partners in the community does help to outline an approach, and a methodology for delivering service. And at the global level also we&apos;ve found that bringing together every major stakeholder, particularly true the Sanitation and Water for All partnership, have been very useful in coming out with WaterAid before a plan of action for delivering service. As you will know, the MDGs were set which was one of those kind of indicators or plan of action for these to happen. The MDGs have been achieved in several of the countries for water but for sanitation we are still lagging behind. I think the essential point here is that when we have set targets and we have plans of action, develop with development partners, donors, funding agencies and the communities and government working together, then we can say this is how we want to progress and this is how we will achieve them. I think it&apos;s possible to deliver a universal service. JV Timeyin, just remind us about, you know, when you bring water to a community what difference does it make? Is this fundamental or is this just a marginal improvement to their lives? TU I think it&apos;s life changing. You have met and I&apos;ve seen communities where the first drop of water or the first gush of water from a well or borehole brings tears to people&apos;s eyes. I&apos;ve seen women whose lives have changed completely because they now can fetch water within five/10 minutes of a walk from their home rather than one hour from their homes. I&apos;ve seen women whose income statures have changed because they can now have time to trade and do something useful and productive with their lives. I&apos;ve seen young girls who have had to drop out of school go back to school because they were menstruating as teenagers and they were not performing well at school. Bringing water and sanitation to such communities is life changing. JV Thierry, could I just come back to you here because I&apos;ve seen Suez at work in Bolivia and elsewhere, and you have the same experiences when you bring piped water into large communities like in Latin America? You find this life changing transformation as well do you? TM Yes we do find it and it&apos;s true that today working closely when we bring the technology and the knowhow with local communities, with inhabitants, with local government or central government is key; water does make a difference and it has to be adapted  the delivery, the models, the methodology and the technology even has to be adapted to the home population we are serving. And even if the technique may be the same, the ways we are going to deliver it will vary significantly from places to places, and we have to adapt both the type of technology and also the pricing models. JV Catarina, do you want to come in here? CdA OK, so what I would like to say is that human rights, I would say they are agnostic in terms of what type of service provision you choose, a government chooses, in order to make sure that access to water and also to sanitation become reality. But even though human rights are agnostic it doesn&apos;t mean that they don&apos;t care, they do care and I would say that there are some preconditions that must be in place in countries to make sure that water provision, whether private or public, meets with human rights, complies with human rights. For example, in cases of private-sector participation one of the things which was mentioned by Thierry was the fact that governments cannot simply say, &quot;OK let the private sector into the country, we wash our hands and they deal with it, they sort out the mess.&quot; This doesn&apos;t work and I think it&apos;s crucial that the local authorities work with, for example, the private sector in order to make sure that things are developed in a way which makes sense for the communities. JV Catarina, let&apos;s hold you there, let Thierry come back in here, these are grave allegations against water companies. TM Just to come back to some example; I truly believe that today in order to achieve the goals it&apos;s about collaboration and co-operation all the way from the start to achieve the results. I totally with the fact that we need to serve the total population and I&apos;d just like to take a few examples of what we are doing in France, not in some other places. For instance, in a place, in Libourne, which is nearby Bordeaux, we have decided to implement a fair pricing scheme by which the first 15 cubic metre of water is almost free. So everybody has access to a little bit of water. Then the price goes up. Just to give you an example, even in developed areas we are modifying today together in collaboration with the local governments, it&apos;s not us alone, but we are helping them and we are providing them with examples and they make a decision, but we&apos;re doing that together. We are implementing new pricing schemes for people to get affordable water everywhere because we see it&apos;s part of our responsibility to do so. JV OK, we&apos;ll leave it there now. Thank you very much everyone. The Guardian&apos;s Lucy Lamble was in Malawi this month looking at water provision. There are two big urban initiatives under way in Lilongwe, the capital, and Blantyre where the government is working with the private sector to improve the provision of piped water. International NGOs WaterAid and Water for People are also involved in the projects working with local organisations to ensure that poorer residents get access to standpipes. First of all she headed south from Lilongwe to look at villagers&apos; access to pipes. LL In rural Dedza district villagers gather to show us their borehole recently installed by NGO Concern Universal with funding from the EU. Members of the water committee explained what having a clean, reliable source of drinking water means to them. Villager He says thank you so much for the assistance that you&apos;ve provided with this hole as well as the committees around here. Villager How was it before without this? Villager Before this borehole they were having problems especially with the kids that are attending this school. During that time without the borehole the students would go to the villages to beg for water. But now with this water point here everything is fine. Villager She says she&apos;s very happy, she&apos;s thankful to the European Union. She says before this borehole they used to go somewhere down the river and it&apos;s a bit far away. So this borehole coming for us here everything&apos;s fine and they&apos;re not suffering from diarrhoea disease anymore. LL Two and a half hours away by car on the outskirts of the capital Lilongwe is Area 50, a low-income district, mainly housing workers at a nearby tobacco factory. Here residents pay for every 20 litre jerry can they fill. Villager I think they appreciate the presence of it just because they were drinking water from unprotected water sources. Villager The water was from unprotected shallow wells and they were drinking bad water without it being treated. Villager With the presence of the ((0:19:30?)) some of the water point diseases has been cholera have been completely omitted like forever, but others like diarrhoea I think they have been tremendously reduced. JV Catarina, everybody wants clean water but the challenge now is to keep up with demand. Where, in your experience, are you finding the bottlenecks; are they financial, are they political, are they social, what&apos;s the problem with getting water to people? CdA For me I would say it&apos;s a problem of power, or lack of power. What I see even in water-scarce countries is that those who hold power and those who hold money get access to water. And those who have no power and those who have no money don&apos;t get access to water. Of course it is also true that there are other factors that make the situation further complicated. I was, for example, on mission in the Pacific Islands in July, in Kiribati and Tuvalu, and obviously these people are also  The size of the problems I mentioned, the political problems I just mentioned, and the invisibility of poorer people there is obviously a problem with climate change. And there are also problems of, for example, the lack of treatment of human waste, the issues of waste water that are polluting the water that it is intended for people to drink. If you don&apos;t talk about it because it is a taboo issue, it&apos;s not a sexy issue, it&apos;s not as sexy as water, then there are public policies to address this problem. So for me these are the problems. And well of course the issues  JV Catarina, let&apos;s hold you there a minute because Timeyin here in the studio is dying to come in. Timeyin, your experience of working in urban areas, in cities, what are the main obstacles you&apos;re finding on the ground in delivering and managing water supplies? TU In line with what Catarina has said I will tell you that there are four key problems for delivering water and sanitation services for the urban communities and actually for also the rural [people that remain]. The first key problem is political priority. A lot of countries have not prioritised water. They have not taken the values that water can bring to development; to productivity, to public health, to environmental sanitation, to all these aspects that can make a better life for people. That&apos;s one, political priority. And that&apos;s strongly followed by the fact that the fact that there&apos;s lack of collaboration and co-operation around a common plan and an action to deliver service to people. Yes we have kind of worked around the MDGs; in some countries progress, like I said, has been made; we&apos;ve produced about 2bn new connections for people across the world, but there are only 783 million people left which means that we can deliver it if we continue the line that we&apos;re going and help the countries that are not doing well to do better. And thirdly there&apos;s a question around capacity  who will deliver this service, particularly in those countries that are not doing well? Who are the civil servants, who are the utilities, who are the community mobilisers, who are the sanitation mobilisers or promoters, who will deliver this and how can they be trained to deliver? And lastly, of course, is the question of funding. And the funding problems are in two directions: one is that we don&apos;t have enough funds, we still need more money. And secondly, the funds that are available are not properly targeted. You would imagine that between 2008 and 2010, the 27 countries that are most affected by lack of services contribute 90% of diarrhoea death across the world. But these countries receive less than 39% of all investments that go into water and sanitation. So if we turn around, like Catarina has been saying, and focus on the inequalities that are happening, not only within regions or within cities or within rural areas and those kinds of places, but the global inequality of funding, and targeting the use of funds we would probably make better progress. So those four issues. JV Thierry, do you want to come in here? What, from the point of view of the world&apos;s largest private water company, what is the big problem that you have: is it political, is it financial, is it social? TM I would definitely agree on what has been said. The first key point is political will, because the main client, even before the users, will be the political authorities and the local authorities. To succeed in water it takes a strong will and it takes time. When you look at the time it took Europe even to develop their sanitation scheme and have all the waste water treated, it took almost 50 years to achieve that. So nothing will happen within one election time so people have to take a very long-term view on this. And that&apos;s one of the key matters so people have to build on a long-term view. Then, of course, you&apos;ve got regulation and enforcement of the regulation that was said about industries, about contamination, about pollution which is very important. If there is regulation but they are not enforced it&apos;s very difficult to do something because the cost will be horrendous. And then of course we&apos;ve got this issue about resources  human and finance. Under the human one we are trying to bring over human resources but it means, in a lot of cases, that we need to train local capabilities, train local people, and we are working a lot on technology and knowhow transfer in order to capacitate people so we can actually bring service to larger people; that&apos;s what we did in Algiers, that&apos;s what we are doing in Jeddah today by capacitating local people and working with people in order to be sure that they can take over the systems after we go; because even the private sector doesn&apos;t have the need to stay forever. I mean it goes from public to private and back from private to public, I mean it&apos;s, for me, there is a respiration between the two models. JV Let&apos;s bring Catarina in here because there&apos;s a fundamental question. Catarina, is it possible to do water provision without privatisation? Is there any reason why water shouldn&apos;t be privatised and handed over to global companies like Suez to manage? I mean what is the problem there, if there is? CdA I&apos;ve been on mission, it was a very interesting mission to Uruguay where there was a referendum. And in the constitution it was decided in this referendum not only that water is a human right but also that the private sector cannot participate. That&apos;s not what I&apos;m advocating from a human rights perspective, I want to be clear. Again I am agnostic. We have 95% of public water provision today in the world and we have billions of people without access to safe water. So it&apos;s not a magical solution, the public sector provision. But it was interesting to see in Uruguay how water provision is public and super-efficient. And people get access, the water quality is good, I was always drinking tap water so this means again it means that there is no magical solution. I think the private sector can participate, the public sector can also participate. What is fundamental is to make sure that the state, the governments, the public authorities remain in control in the sense that they regulate, they establish the tariffs. They set the rules of the game that have to be complied with either by a public company or by a private one. JV Catarina, hold it there because we&apos;ve got a new question here from Sarah Fisk who&apos;s written in to ask you, part of the problem is actually treating water as a commodity so we sell it through an auction to the highest bidder. What she&apos;s saying is in order to have access to a resource, be it a human right like drinkable water or fresh air, let&apos;s say, do we take it off the auction block and decommodify it? Timeyin, do you think that water is becoming commodified? TU I think that water is not a commodity. Unfortunately, yes the private sector, and this debate which is distracting actually from achieving the MDG, is trying to make water a commodity. I think that&apos;s very sad. Water is a means for life. Water itself is life. Without water no human being can survive for more than three days. So we need to make sure that everybody gets water to drink. As far back as the 16th and 17th century Adam Smith talked about the diamond-water paradox where he was talking about the utility of water to the human being. Every human being will die, will struggle, will pay anything for the first drop of life of water to keep life at the basic level. And government must protect that otherwise we&apos;ll set ourselves up for inequalities and for debts based on poverty and social divides. Government must guarantee the fact that people need basic services, water in particular and sanitation, and ensure that no price should be charged beyond what is affordable. For those who cannot afford it government should subsidise this process to make sure that they get that benefit. When you have left the level of the basic need and somebody wants to fill a swimming pool or put extra water in his bath, for example, or flush toilets and stuff like that using water beyond basic needs, then you need to start putting in prices to ensure that we do not use water and take it for granted. Because it&apos;s a common resource that we all need for agriculture, we need it for power generation, we need it for public health, so we need to protect the cost of that extra use of water. But at the basic life-giving and lifesaving level of water need, government must protect that every citizen everywhere in the world get access to water. JV And finally this is one for everyone who&apos;s picked up on that exact thing. Someone called Risch Barnard asks: why is this comparison in commodity and human rights so established? Is it because it&apos;s easier to grasp if we have on the one side this, on the one side that. So the question is should we be looking for a more nuanced solution? Catarina, could you come in here please? CdA I think it&apos;s, I agree, I think this antagonism is to make the discussion, I would say, sexier. I think that we have to also depart from the idea that water is a human right hence it should be provided for free; or water should not be a commodity and hence it should be provided for free. I don&apos;t agree with that idea. I think that it is fair for us to pay for the water that we consume. Maybe many of us don&apos;t pay enough for the water that we consume, that&apos;s what I think. What is fundamental is to make sure that poor people, and people who cannot afford to pay a normal, reasonable price for the water, are not deprived from their human right just because they don&apos;t have the money. And maybe there are situations where the government has to subsidise, we have to find more nuanced solutions, I agree with that, to make sure that even though people have to pay for it, it is affordable. That we find mechanisms, gross subsidisation, subsidies from the state, whichever means to make sure that nobody&apos;s deprived from this human right simply because he/she cannot pay for it for reasons beyond his/her control. JV Catarina, well said. Now, Thierry, what are your final thoughts on this one? TM I think that the fact that access to water has become a human right, it does create a new discussion with local authorities and I think it&apos;s very positive because we are now in a position by which we can even tell local government we need to do something about it and have an open discussion about how we are going to do it, on what planning, what time, and that&apos;s very positive in the sense that it can no longer be something avoided. And I think it does create political stamina; it creates political will because people have to deal with it because it has been elevated to a point which people cannot avoid that matter and I think that&apos;s very positive for everyone. And I fully agree with the fact that we have two issues; we have the issue of bringing water to the people. And the second matter is the matter of affordability. Water has to have a price but it must be reasonable. And for some part of the population it needs to be subsidised in order for people to have access in all conditions to a minimal amount of water. JV Timeyin, we seem to be reaching  what&apos;s the word  consensus on this one, do you want to wrap up your thoughts on this? TU I think the way we sometimes use semantics in the water sector, I think what we need to focus on in the water sector is how we want to get from here to universal access or universal services  water for everybody everywhere, which is the goal that WaterAid is hoping that the world can set for itself post-2015. And in that way we&apos;re thinking that we&apos;ll almost come together because there&apos;s a growing consensus amongst all of us professionals in the water sector that it is possible to provide water for everybody, to provide sanitation for everybody because of the progress you have made in the last 15 years from the year 2000 to 2015 we can see that we are making a projection, the trend of progression is towards achieving universal access. So we&apos;re saying basically that as the post-2015 debates continue and the reports come to the UN, the general assembly must agree that we all should give water to everybody everywhere by 2030. We set a date and we all work together to make sure that that happens and we need political commitment; we need innovative partnerships, we need integrated approaches, and we need financial investments that will take us to that goal. We think that it is possible, the debates about subsidies, about pricing, about who provides the services are all things that we have some consensus around. And we also have the technology because we have shown before that we have connected two billion people in the last 15 years. We can connect the next 1 billion over the next 15 years. JV Well on that very optimistic note we&apos;ll have to leave it. My thanks very much for listening. The guests today were Timeyin Uwejamomere, Catarina de Albuquerque, Thierry Mallet and Dr Peter Gleick in California. And if you&apos;ve enjoyed this, our friends at Guardian Books are also marking World Water Day this year with a specially commissioned series of short stories from around the world on the theme of water. So you can hear the great AS Byatt talking about garbage dumping in the ocean; and Iraqi author, Hassan Blasim, imagining the incipient wars for control of water on land. You can find all that for free at theguardian.com/books. My name is John Vidal. The producer was Matt Hill. Thank you all for listening. Thank you.",

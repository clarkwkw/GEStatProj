    "text": "The discovery of the Higgs boson particle is one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time. It was so bold and strange and extremely exciting to know, once and for all, that something I had learned about all the way through university, and my PhD, worked and that the theory was right. The impact is enormous. Until this year there had been many theoretical physicistsworking on many different ideas  there have been huge amounts of work onthe bigproblems of the picture of our universe at a quantum (or particle) level. Now we know the solution to one of them, so all future theories have got to be consistent with this. We have a signpost of which wayto go. This is not esoteric: we actually did smashprotons together very close to the speed of light and what came out was aHiggs particle. It&apos;s not ethereal nonsense  there really are these particles and we reallyare interacting with them. No matter how manytimes you&apos;re reminded of our astonishing intellectual achievements, and this is one of the greatest, it&apos;s still surprising. The hubristic nature of daring to imagine it,of daring to say: &quot;This is how I think the universe works&quot;, is truly brilliant. It&apos;s difficult for anyone to get their head around  it&apos;s only a century ago that Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus. We didn&apos;t even know that atoms existed 150 years ago. This will speed up our understanding of the universe rapidly.",

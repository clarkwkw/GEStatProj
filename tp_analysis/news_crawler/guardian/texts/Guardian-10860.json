    "text": "The Lego games, which seek to rebuild colossi of contemporary family cinema franchises in miniature bricks, have rather less to do with the plastic stuff from which they take their name than appearances suggest. The physical toy is a creative material that allows us to build from the imagination in near limitless ways. From a relatively small palette of interconnecting bricks  which click together with all the reassurance of a lipstick lid - one can fashion everything from a lopsided hot-rod to a lumpy dog to the Taj Mahal. Therein lies its simple wonder and universal appeal. Traveller&apos;s Tales&apos; games, by contrast, are entirely prescribed. You squeeze a button and the loose collection of bricks at your character&apos;s feet assembles itself in a magical micro-hurricane into a bridge or a ladder or whatever object is needed to facilitate minifigure Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker or Indiana Jones&apos;s pre-laid story. There is no capacity for personalisation; a player may only affect the rate at which they move towards the conclusion. If Minecraft is the true freeform construction game, offering players a world of blocks to heave into a world of shapes, the orthodox Lego games have us closely following an instruction manual. Piece by piece we reveal the predestined finished article, meticulously prepared for us by the game&apos;s designers. While these releases may fail to encapsulate the physical toy&apos;s primary appeal then, their formula has been apocalyptically successful, as evidenced by the value of the various IPs Travellers&apos; Tales that has been called upon to work alongside. But the developer could hardly be accused of creative laziness within the parameters it has set for itself. The basics of the recipe remain consistent  each cinematic plotline split into 18 sequential stages; the characters divided into &quot;types&quot;, each with their own set of exclusive abilities which must be called upon to overcome obstacles; the post-completion secret hunting  but the structure is ever-changing. Lego Lord of the Rings presents the most dramatic overhaul yet, retaining the 18-stage structure, but granting players the run of Middle Earth in between these climactic chapters. It&apos;s not quite Lego Skyrim, but these hills and valleys are filled with nooks and secrets, valuable bricks hidden behind waterfalls and deep inside yawning caves, the land seasoned with eager minifigs waiting to send you off on fetch quests. It&apos;s this expanse of hub that gives Lego Lord of the Rings a rare sense of scale and place, one articulated by a map that, more than in Tolkien&apos;s prose or Jackson&apos;s film, allows one to understand exactly how Shire links to Mordor in geographical terms. The 18 missions chart Frodo and Samwise Gamgee&apos;s epic journey, from Hobbiton to Rivendell, Isengard to Minas Tirith, all the way to the Black Gate. For the first time audio is lifted from the most recent trilogy of movies, with the minifigs speaking, rather than silent acting. Some of the previous games&apos; Reduced Shakespeare Company-esque levity is lost in the decision, but the developer plays the on-screen action off against the actors with wit and style and, besides, it would be perhaps too tricky to communicate the twists of this plot in silent movie form. You take a clutch of characters from the Fellowship into each mission, switching between them as and when you require each one&apos;s unique skill. For example, Gimli is the only character that can smash through cracked boulders, while fleet-of-foot elf Legolas is needed to fire arrows into targets in order to create arrow walkways. There is, more than in any previous Lego title, a great deal of switching between characters and, at times returning to wring every last secret from a stage can feel like busy work. Another first for a Lego game are lost objects in these stages, dropped by the citizens of Middle Earth who will offer you a bonus for each you return to them. With three of the these in each stage there is a huge number of fetch quests to complete and, without a clear task list of where to deliver each item to, delivering the objects son becomes tiring. Instead of hidden Gold Bricks, Lego Lord of the Rings is filled with Mithril Bricks, which must be scavenged from both stages and Middle Earth. Far from a meaningless token, these bricks act as a raw material that can be delivered to the blacksmith in Bree, who, when you&apos;ve found the relevant &quot;recipe&quot; will create sought after Mithril items for your characters to wear or weild, improving their abilities or dress sense. Finally, new characters may be purchased for play as you encounter them about Middle Earth, expanding both your roster and your clutch of abilities as you work to catch &apos;em all. Traveller&apos;s Tales works considerable acrobatic feats within the Lego games template with Tolkien&apos;s work  which proves ideal source material for another game of this sort, with the requisite range of characters, tasks and, crucially, mystical world. The more ambitious surrounding artifice may alienate much younger players, while the lack of quest lists with which to track your progress will frustrate older, more seasoned virtual adventurers. This is a less focused game than the most recent Lego Harry Potter game, then, thoughtfully assembled but ultimately failing to rule them all.",

    "headline": "Is Cranfield's postgraduate-only university a model for the future?", 
    "text": "An untidy cluster of modified aircraft hangars, former RAF barracks and 1960s accommodation blocks in fields near Milton Keynes is not the most obviously inspiring of sites. But Cranfield University in Bedfordshire has proved an inspiration for the universities minister, David Willetts, who recently cited it as a possible model for a new breed of university  one dedicated to science and dominated by postgraduates. His vision, described to the Policy Exchange thinktank earlier this month, was of new partnerships between overseas and UK universities, or between universities and business, to set up institutions that would help to make the UK the &quot;best place in the world to do science&quot;. And he invited proposals from organisations interested in establishing this type of institution, so long as they came up with their own money. Willetts drew on an initiative by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, to develop a graduate school on the city&apos;s Roosevelt Island in a partnership between Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. But as the UK&apos;s only science and technology-led, postgraduate-only university, Cranfield provided a homegrown example of his idea. Willetts, who first visited the university early in his ministerial career for the 2010 Universities UK annual conference, was invited back after this month&apos;s speech, and noted both its &quot;array of sophisticated research&quot; and potential for &quot;driving growth and boosting UK manufacturing&quot;. Founded just after the second world war as the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, which, thanks to its setting, still carries a 1950s &quot;chocks away&quot; feel alongside the high tech, expanded into other technologies, manufacturing and management, achieving full degree-awarding powers in 1969. It now has around 4,000 full- and part-time students from 100 different countries and works with more than 750 businesses across six continents. A yard and shed house the smashed carcasses of train carriages and aircraft, and even the hull of a ship, where students investigate the results of real accidents. Specialising in a limited number of areas  aerospace, automotive, health, environment, management, manufacturing, security and defence  its emphasis is on &quot;putting innovation into action&quot;. &quot;What gives our people the buzz is that while the paper in an academic journal is fantastic, for them it is not only about the study,&quot; says Clifford Friend, deputy vice-chancellor. &quot;It is going into a supermarket and seeing products they have worked on. That is as much a driver for them as a big academic paper.&quot; It is easy to see why this ethos, combined with the fact that Cranfield&apos;s turnover is 180m a year , while it receives a mere 15% of its income in government grants, is attractive for a government strapped for cash and keen to close Britain&apos;s gap between innovation and producing something marketable. But how realistic is it as a model that could be translated more widely? David Docherty, chief executive of the Council for Industry and Higher Education, says many of Britain&apos;s existing universities were originally founded in the 19th century with money from industrialists, and modern examples already exist of business making long-term investments in university research, such as the BP Institute at Cambridge, and Jaguar Land Rover&apos;s involvement in Warwick University&apos;s Warwick Manufacturing Group. &quot;Whether businesses will step up and fund the idea is something we will only find out through practical experience,&quot; he says. &quot;They will only do it if they can see long-term benefits.&quot; Sir John O&apos;Reilly, Cranfield&apos;s vice chancellor, says the ideas of boosting science and tapping business potential are good, but that Willetts&apos;s proposals are different from both the Cornell and Cranfield models because they carry no government cash. &quot;We get funding  nowhere near the same as traditional universities, but without that it would be a very steep hill to climb,&quot; he says. He suggests that businesses would only be likely to contribute if they could see clear value coming out of it, and that while Cranfield receives relatively little public money directly, indirectly its dependence is much higher. With half of its income streams traceable in some way back to government, it can suffer when public sector money is tight. Recent cutbacks in defence spending, for example, are likely to have a knock-on effect. In fact, times have been tough for Cranfield. Its reliance on business for research and training contracts makes it vulnerable in a recession, when companies tend to cut back on expenditure seen as non-essential. Its high proportion of international students means it had particular concerns over last year&apos;s changes to student visa numbers, although Friend says its international student numbers have steadied after an initial wobble. Then there is the uncertainty over what effects this year&apos;s radical changes to undergraduate funding will have on postgraduates. Being a one-of-a-kind institution means it can suffer &quot;unintended consequences&quot; from policy changes made with more mainstream institutions in mind, says Sir John O&apos;Reilly, so it has to keep constantly flexible. &quot;One of our particular achievements is still being here,&quot; he says. What O&apos;Reilly welcomes unequivocally in Willetts&apos;s speech is its recognition of postgraduates, and the suggestion that their needs and contribution are finally being considered. Neglected by both Lord Browne&apos;s report on the future of higher education, and the government&apos;s subsequent white paper, postgraduates have been left in limbo while attention has focused on increasing undergraduate tuition fees up to 9,000. Yet they too are also likely to see significant rises. Taught postgraduate courses will be affected as much as undergraduate courses by the government&apos;s decision to remove the teaching grant from universities, while institutions charging undergraduates 9,000 could be reluctant to charge postgraduates less. Nor will postgraduates be able to access the new undergraduate loan system, which has implications for fair access. This is something that particularly concerns the National Union of Students, which argues that disadvantaged students carrying undergraduate debts of more than 27,000 are also less likely to consider postgraduate education. O&apos;Reilly, who says Cranfield is planning to increase its UK student fees  now around 7,000  as a result of the changes, argues that swift action is needed to ensure that postgraduates will be able to pay. &quot;There is a lot of uncertainty out there,&quot; he says. These uncertainties aside, he sees huge advantages in the postgraduate-only model. For Cranfield, he says, it has meant being able to respond to real business needs in a multidisciplinary way rather than being tied to distinct undergraduate disciplines, such as physics or chemistry. It has also enabled a &quot;symbiotic&quot; relationship between teaching and innovation, and concentrated a large number of able scientists and industry professionals as if in a vast lab. Students seem to like this aspect of the institution, and appreciate the contact with teachers who are also practitioners.Despite their enthusiasm, not even Cranfield&apos;s managers are convinced that they hold the only answer to Britain&apos;s future scientific needs. &quot;We are flattered that Willetts praised what we do, but this isn&apos;t a model that every university should follow,&quot; says Friend. Docherty nevertheless thinks it has potential. &quot;Can you create a Cranfield with private funding in a new city?&quot; he asks. &quot;It&apos;s a big question, but it&apos;s not a stupid one.&quot;",

    "text": "Windows 8 will be &quot;released to manufacturing&quot; in the first week of August, and will move to &quot;general availability&quot; for everyone by the end of October, Microsoft has announced. Speaking at Microsoft&apos;s Worldwide Partner Conference in the US, Tami Reller, the vice-president for Windows, gave the dates when the finished software would be sent out to companies so that they can test and include it on PCs  the &quot;release to manufacture&quot;, or &quot;RTM&quot; date  and the later date when people will be able to buy and download it directly from Microsoft. Microsoft has already announced a scheme which mean that people who bought a PC running Windows 7 after 2 June will be able to upgrade to Windows 8 for just $15.  Windows 8 will automatically be included as the basic system on PCs that go on sale from late October, or possibly before. Microsoft will also offer a free cloud storage account using its SkyDrive system to every Windows 8 buyer. Microsoft is introducing a new system for buying third-party software, called &quot;The Windows Store&quot;, with Windows 8. That will only offer approved and checked software for sale.  Windows 7 was available in both boxed and download forms, and Windows 8 is expected to follow the same pattern. Windows is a key revenue and profit generator for Microsoft, with about 400m PCs being sold every year around the world, each generating an average about $50 of revenue and $35 of profit per machine; profits from the Windows division makes up more than half of Microsoft&apos;s quarterly profits. But recently is has come under assault from the rise in smartphones and sales of tablets, particularly Apple&apos;s iPad, while sales of PCs have been showing slowing growth and even reverses. That has led Microsoft to re-magine the interface for Windows, with the &quot;Metro&quot; interface of Windows 8 offering the most radical departure in experience since the introduction of the Start button in Windows 95.",

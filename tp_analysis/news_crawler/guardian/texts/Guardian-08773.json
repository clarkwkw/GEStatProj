    "text": "Three weeks into Les Ebdon&apos;s tenure as director of Offa (the Office of Fair Access) and he has got his work cut out. Many universities just aren&apos;t doing enough to widen admissions to students from poorer backgrounds. The need to succeed goes beyond merely creating higher education opportunities for the disadvantaged  almost our entire school-leaver careers guidance provision is in his hands. When the government closed AimHigher and Connexions last year, sixth-formers and FE students were left with only whatever careers advice their schools and colleges felt they should or could provide  even though they have no funding nor any statutory requirement to do so. For under 16s, the 2011 Education Act introduced a weak obligation to provide guidance, but without money, KPIs or any thorough inspection regime. Around 450m was cut in total and replaced with the National Careers Service: a website and helpline with no special remit to help school-leavers. This has left a massive vacuum in careers advice in sixth forms. The government hoped that universities would fill it through outreach. And given that Offa will be ensuring that a proportion of tuition fees is spent on access arrangements, the money available for careers education should be rising, not falling. In theory, at least. In practice, the money is spent in several ways, most of which do not support careers advice and may not even be hugely effective at widening participation. There are bursaries (which target pupils who don&apos;t usually know about them), fee waivers (the same, but worse, as they also help graduates only retrospectively and even then, just the ones who end up better off), and retention measures (which are good, but obviously, only for students who&apos;ve already decided to go to university). Then there&apos;s outreach, which, as Ebdon&apos;s predecessor Sir Martin Harris noted, seems to be the most effective way of widening access to those who are most indifferent to the notion that higher education is for them. The clue is in the name: to reach out you need outreach. But university efforts in schools face several challenges: 1) Universities do not deliver impartial advice With the best will in the world, they are likely to promote higher education in general and their institution in particular. Never mind about students who don&apos;t want to go to university, who can&apos;t, or for whom it&apos;s not the right path. Even if a university&apos;s outreach tries to be independent, they are not likely to be seen as such, which can be almost as damaging. Is it too cynical to suggest that some universities even regard their outreach activities as a way of writing off some marketing costs as &apos;access arrangements&apos;? 2) Outreach rarely travels far enough Given the choice of visiting a school with 75% progression rates and one with 5%, a university may be justified in thinking that its budget is better spent where more students are possibly already in the higher education market. Participation won&apos;t be widened if the bright-enough pupils in more disadvantaged schools are left to rot. The same goes for schools outside the university&apos;s catchment. In London or Manchester, that&apos;s not a problem. There are plenty of universities. But in Truro? There are pockets of the country with schools receiving no outreach. 3) Quality of provision often goes unchecked I&apos;ve seen many presentations in schools by universities. I&apos;ve seen good talks and bad talks. I&apos;ve seen some that are inspiring, but do not actually offer good and impartial careers advice. I&apos;ve seen others that are just plain wrong on the facts. All too often, outreach by universities is done by people with no careers qualifications or training, sometimes by student ambassadors who, while they have a role to play, are over-reaching their limited expertise. It&apos;s the crucial difference between information, which they&apos;re able to provide, and advice and guidance, which they&apos;re not. 4) Most outreach adopts a hit-and-run approach  Outreach teams arrive in a school, raise aspirations and then leave the carrot dangling with no help to get at it. What&apos;s needed is ongoing engagement and support. Apart from the fact that this is more effective, it&apos;s only by staying in touch with students that you can solve the next problem. 5) Outcomes are rarely measurable or comparable Our higher education sector is diverse and if you only hear from one institution, you don&apos;t get an accurate picture. Some third sector and even private organisations have started to try to offer solutions, but as Alex Bols of the 1994 Group has argued, a national framework is needed. I am involved in an initiative, Push Talks, that seeks to provide just that and is supported by, among others, the Association of Graduate Recruiters. It is not just students and universities who stand to lose from the careers education vacuum. It&apos;s employers too who will find a poorly advised talent pipeline doesn&apos;t produce the school-leavers and graduates they need. The objective has to be to get universities, recruiters and other stakeholders to club together to use whatever funding is available to deliver a broad, fair and cost-effective outreach programme that works and can prove it.

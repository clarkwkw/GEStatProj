    "text": "Often free of commercial concerns and the controlling hand of a parent company, browser developers continue to earn themselves a reputation as game design&apos;s creatively risky frontiersmen. Black Box, the latest effort by developer Eyezmaze, is a case in point  a perfect specimen of a title unlikely to appear anywhere else. Taking only a brief period to complete, Black Box is as much a digital toy as video game and presents the player with little more at the start than the eponymous cube. Jabbing away at the box with a cursor causes the container to evolve, gradually turning it into a charming and elaborate robot, brimming with playful mysteries. Elsewhere, Eruption, created in just one week, delivers a lo-fi platform game based around ideas of the soul and the theme of &quot;contrast&quot;. The brief was set in a recent round of the LudumDare competition, which challenges developers to create games in short periods of time. This is a bare-bones experience, but none the less full of goodideas. If that isn&apos;t abstract enough, then maybe ir/rational will suit. Something of an exploration of propositional logic crossed with a word game, it asks players to question the reality of their existence, the possibility of God&apos;s presence and other big ideas. The player is charged with presenting arguments to progress, making it a title unlike any other mainstream release. None of these titles dazzles with bigbudget gloss, but all display no shortage of imagination.",

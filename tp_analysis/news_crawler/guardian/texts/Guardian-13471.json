    "text": "Developer Crystal Dynamics returns Lara Croft to her classic gaming roots in this Tomb Raider reboot, but far from being the wisecracking action heroine from previous games, this is a vulnerable, relatable Lara  and that makes for a more engaging adventure.It&apos;s still Tomb Raider  an epic action platformer with treasure to hunt, locations to explore and wolves to slay. But there&apos;s a survival horror element here as well, crystallised in Lara&apos;s attempt to escape a mysterious island. It does lack originality, the supporting characters are bland, and there&apos;s an incessant overuse of context-sensitive button pressing. These minor criticisms aside, however, Tomb Raider is a slick, visually impressive, action-packed adventure with a deep multiplayer mode. Most importantly, it&apos;s Lara&apos;s best game in more than a decade.",

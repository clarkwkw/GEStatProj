    "text": "Every year around this time, clusters of newly minted &quot;adults&quot; in caps and gowns sit like sponges, soaking up the wisdom that booms from the front of the auditorium: &quot;Parents, friends, distinguished guests, graduates of the class of 2013 &quot; So begins the commencement speech, a tradition at college and university graduations around the US. They can be boring, they can be painfully sincere, and they can also be the stuff of legend. Nearly 10 years after David Foster Wallace presented This is Water at Kenyon College, the speech was transformed into a short film and went viral. Last year had some pretty powerful speeches, and 2013 is off to a pretty good start. Navigate this list to see who&apos;s taken a turn at the podium so far:  Week one: * Joe Biden * Michelle Obama (Round One) * Julie Andrews * Nate Silver* Neil deGrasse Tyson* Bill Clinton* Melinda Gates Week two * Barack Obama* Michelle Obama (Round Two)* Cory Booker* Stephen Colbert* Arianna Huffington Vice-president Joe Biden, University of Pennsylvania, 13 May: &apos;I&apos;m not making this up&apos;              Say what? &quot;There will be no U-Haul truck behind my casket.&quot;Quotes: Steve Jobs.Theme: Hard to pin down. The veep&apos;s speech touched on pretty much everything: immigration, gay rights, climate change, the economy, technological innovation, women&apos;s rights, Vietnam, China&apos;s expansion and the war in Iraq. Humor: Five-star. By far the funniest of the recent commencement addresses. Advice: &quot;I have gained too much wisdom to offer any advice.&quot;Best line: &quot;Don&apos;t listen to the cynics. They were wrong about my generation and they were wrong about yours.&quot;  Michelle Obama, Eastern Kentucky University, 11 May: &apos;We&apos;re all called to serve&apos;       First lady Michelle Obama, left, delivers a commencement speech at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Ky. Photograph: James Crisp/AP    In her first of three commencement speeches this year, Flotus urged graduates to go out and find students with different systems of belief. &quot;If you&apos;re a Democrat, spend some time talking to a Republican,&quot; Obama told about 600 education, business and technology graduates last weekend. &quot;And if you&apos;re a Republican, have a chat with a Democrat. We know what happens when we only talk to people who think like we do. We just get stuck in our ways.&quot; Julie Andrews, University of Colorado, 10 May: &apos;When adversity hits, go out and learn something&apos;              Say what? &quot;When I was driving in from the airport, I wanted to get out of the car, go over to a grassy knoll and do my signature turn from the Sound of Music.&quot;Quotes: TH WhiteTheme: The importance and power of the arts.Humor: 2/5.We learned: Andrews never finished high school and she also never went to college.Applause: Loud.Surprise: Many more sound of music references than we had anticipated.Best line: &quot;So congratulations, dear students.

It means learning from your mistakes and changing your behavior next time around.&quot;We learned: &quot;The trees are just the right size at Ripon&quot;.In a word: Literal.Applause: He doesn&apos;t stop talking for long enough to hear any.Most similar to: One of his columns read aloud. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Rice University, 11 May: &apos;America has lost its exploratory compass&apos;   The popular astrophysicist&apos;s powerful speech focused on space funding. He spoke of the current state of space exploration and told the new graduates that the future of the industry is in their hands.    Just heard @neiltyson speak at Rice Univerity commencement, great speech with lots of NASA and space references to inspire the students &mdash; Mike Massimino (@Astro_Mike) May 11, 2013    &quot;You know why [private enterprise] can&apos;t lead it? Because space is expensive, it&apos;s dangerous and it has unquantified risks. You put all three of those under one umbrella  it cannot establish a capital market valuation of that exercise.&quot; Bill Clinton, Howard University, 11 May: &apos;You must feel empowered&apos;              Say what? &quot;I am well aware that the commencement speech is the least important part of this day.&quot;Quotes: The Quran, The Bible, The Dhammapada.Theme: What we have in common is more important than our difference.Humor: 3/5.We learned: At Clinton&apos;s Georgetown graduation, a hard rain cut the mayor&apos;s commencement speech short. &quot;Congratulations.

I want you to connect because it will inspire you to do something. To take action. To make a difference in the world. Humanity in the abstract will never inspire you the way meeting another human being will. Poverty is not going to inspire you to do something, but meeting people  that will inspire you.  Barack Obama, Morehouse College, 19 May: &apos;Along with collective responsibilities, we have individual responsibilities&apos;               Say what? &quot;Some of you are graduating summa cum laude.

Seriously.Applause: Frequent.Best line:   &quot;Remember that while there will be plenty of signposts along your path directing you to make money and climb up the ladder, there will be very few signposts reminding you to stay connected to the essence of who you are, to take care of yourself along the way, to reach out to others, to pause to wonder, and to connect to that place from which everything is possible.&quot; ",

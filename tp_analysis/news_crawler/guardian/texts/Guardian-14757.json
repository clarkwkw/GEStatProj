    "text": "Shinji Mikami, creator of the Resident Evil series, has announced a new survival horror game, The Evil Within, which is due for release next year. The trailer depicts plenty of bloodthirsty supernatural nasties, although proper details remain sketchy. Games currently doing the rounds include Lego City Undercover: The Chase Begins (3DS), a law-abiding GTA-alike that loses much of its comedic charm in translation to portable; Dark (Xbox, PS3, PC), a low-budget stealth action game with vampires and a cel-shaded look; uninspiring racing game, Crash Time 5 (Xbox, PS3, PC), which is apparently based on a German TV series; lightweight RPG, Mars: War Logs (Xbox, PS3, PC) about settlers on the Red Planet; and Thomas Was Alone, the excellent and strangely moving independently produced platform game is making its way to PS3 and Vita.",

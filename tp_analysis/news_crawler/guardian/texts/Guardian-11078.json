    "text": "Having seen successive governments drive through countless new policies and ideas, the teaching profession is well accustomed to change. But since the coalition government came to power, the pace has been particularly bracing. The expansion of the academies and free school programmes, a major review of the national curriculum and the introduction of a new GCSE equivalent qualification  the English baccalaureate certificate (EBC)  are just some of the new developments educators have had to take on board over the past few years. A poll of more than 100 teachers carried out at the Guardian&apos;s Innovation in Education conference on Thursday suggests this could be taking its toll: more than 86% said they felt there was a problem with staff morale in the teaching profession. &quot;People feel that whatever they do, it&apos;s not good enough and whatever they do, Ofsted are going to come and hit them over the head, and we as headteachers have to manage that,&quot; said Kenny Frederick, principal of George Green&apos;s school in the Isle of Dogs, in east London. Innovation can end up taking second place to the more immediate pressures to meet targets and perform well in league tables. Keynote speaker Sir John Rowling, founder of the Pixl group of headteachers, argued that school leaders spend far too much time observing lessons when they should be involved in activities that energise staff. But despite the pressures, teachers should not lose sight of their core purpose, he said. &quot;What matters here is not performance tables  it&apos;s kids&apos; futures and we&apos;ll get it right, by legitimate means, because we care about kids.&quot; Competition was a central theme of the day, with 64% of teachers saying that in the current landscape, they feel schools are competing, rather than collaborating. But in a panel session on school partnership models, it was acknowledged that competition and collaboration are not necessarily polar opposites, with Robert Hill, visiting senior research fellow at the Department of Education and Professional Studies, King&apos;s College London, arguing that aligning the two can actually drive innovation. &quot;Some teachers would say &apos;I collaborate so I can compete&apos;,&quot; he said. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), questioned whether current education policies are too focused on &quot;managed collaboration&quot;  in the form of academy chains and federations, for example  at the expense of more traditional forms of collaboration, where schools help each other on an informal basis. According to the Programme of International Student Assessment (Pisa), the UK has one of the biggest gaps in the achievement of rich and poor children. Speakers put forward potential solutions. Prof Bette Chambers, director of the Institute for Effective Education at the University of York, argued that an &quot;evidence-based&quot; approach, using proven educational methods  as opposed to new fads or trends  was needed. But Peter Hyman, Tony Blair&apos;s former adviser, now founder and headteacher of School 21, a free school in Stratford, east London, argued for more flexibility. Many secondary schools are simply &quot;far too big to get the quality of relationships needed [to help pupils achieve], particularly in the most disadvantaged areas,&quot; he said. At School 21, a lot of thought has gone into class size, the length of lessons and creating &quot;a relevant and exciting curriculum&quot;. At a session on the recent government green paper for special educational needs, which proposes  among other things  to replace SEN statements with broader health, education and care plans, Dean Beadle, a 22-year-old with Asperger&apos;s syndrome, spoke powerfully about his own experiences of school. Building on the individual passions of young people with learning or other disabilities  rather than treating them &quot;as numbers on a sheet of paper&quot; can reap rich rewards, he said. &quot;Children with special needs colour the world beautifully. It&apos;s a high mountain to climb, but has the best view at the top when you get there.&quot; The closing session of the day focused on whether the UK is in a &quot;golden&quot; time of curriculum innovation. Trevor Averre-Beeson, director of education and founder at Lilac Sky Schools, questioned why children are still being taught the way they were 200 years ago  all too often in rows of desks, in large groups in large schools  when advances in technology offer far more stimulating and exciting alternatives. Joe Hallgarten, director of education at the Royal Society of Arts, argued that innovation is only needed if there is a problem. &quot;And we do have a problem with children  even high achievers  being disengaged or unmotivated by what&apos;s on offer,&quot; he said.&quot;When young people leave school we want them to put on their &apos;L&apos; plates, not take them off.&quot; Involving children in the design of curriculum content is one possible solution, but it has to be done in &quot;genuine partnership,&quot; said Hallgarten. But while acknowledging the importance of getting students&apos; views, Averre-Beeson sounded a note of caution. &quot;Should we ask the children what they want to learn? Only if we are prepared to teach whatever they say.&quot; Who said what  Catherine Brentnall, director, Rotherham Ready &quot;Is a good clutch of GCSEs and A-levels a genuine indicator of success in today&apos;s world? I&apos;m afraid qualifications alone won&apos;t cut it.&quot;  Martin Johnson, deputy general secretary, Association of Teachers and Lecturers &quot;One of the most serious flaws in education is that few organisations seriously measure teachers&apos; morale.&quot;  Brett Wigdortz, founder, Teach First &quot;I say to our teachers &apos;You have to believe there is social injustice out there you want to do something about it. &apos;  Dean Beadle, motivational speaker &quot;It&apos;s worrying how much parents of children with special needs are told &apos;your child will achieve nothing.&apos;  Professor Bette Chambers, director, Institute for Effective Education, University of York &quot;Teachers need a &apos;to don&apos;t&apos; list rather than a &apos;to do&apos; list  there are so many new initiatives about.&quot;  Peter Hyman, founder and headteacher, School 21 &quot;In a big school, it&apos;s about surface learning and surface relationships. But you&apos;ve got to have deep relationships and deep learning. You&apos;ve got to go deeper.&quot;  Barbara Bergstrm, founder and chairman of the board of directors, Internationella Engelska &quot;For us teachers, it&apos;s a calling. Are you willing to work 24/7? Because that&apos;s what the job entails.&quot;",

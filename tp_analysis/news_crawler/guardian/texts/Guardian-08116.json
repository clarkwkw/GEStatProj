    "text": "This is the latest version of our now-weekly Android apps roundup, spotlighting the best new apps from the last seven days. It doesn&apos;t include games they get a separate roundup. Meanwhile, the weekly iOS apps roundup can be found here. Here&apos;s this week&apos;s Android selection: Amazon Appstore Amazon&apos;s Android app store, er, app has been out for some time in the US. Now it&apos;s available in the UK and other European countries too, via a download link on the Amazon website. The app enables you to browse apps, get recommendations and download them to the device, while also offering Amazon&apos;s daily free app deal. SkyDrive Microsoft&apos;s SkyDrive cloud service has made its way onto Android. The app helps people access the files they&apos;ve stored in their SkyDrive locker including opening them in other apps  upload photos and videos from their smartphones, and send links to those files to others. C4 Paralympics As on iOS, Channel 4&apos;s official Paralympic Games app offers live text commentary, video highlights, schedules, results and news on smartphones, with added livestreaming video for the tablet version. Hooha for App.net US entrepreneur Dalton Caldwell sailed past his $500k crowdfunding goal to build a &quot;real-time social feed&quot; as a more-open alternative to Twitter, and the service is already up and running in alpha. Now a developer has made its first mobile app for Android. Hooha is equally &quot;raw alpha&quot; in its nature, helping users view their streams, mentions and global posts, while composing and replying. Magisto Video-editing app Magisto has been a hit on iOS, and now it&apos;s available for Android too. The twist is that the actual video-editing process is automated: users upload footage from their phones and choose soundtracks, before Magisto&apos;s software handles the splicing part. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube sharing are all included. CNN / Time Convention Floorpass This roundup is a little late for the Republican convention, but CNN and Time&apos;s joint app was available beforehand  and is still good for the Democrats&apos; event. The app offers news and analysis from CNN and Time&apos;s political journalists, while tying in Twitter, Foursquare and CNN&apos;s own iReport citizen journalism service. Nothing Ever Happens at the South Pole Oceanhouse Media has released dozens of apps based on different Dr. Seuss books. This uses a different source: an unpublished 1960s book by Berenstain Bears authors Stan and Jan Berenstain about the South Pole. Aimed at children, it follows the journey of a penguin looking for icy excitement. Intro Intro is a social location app designed for business rather than personal use, helping people meet potential work contacts when in the same area. It also sims to match freelancers to projects that suit their skills, cutting out the recruitment agency middlemen.     Stereomood provides mood-based music playlists    Stereomood Stereomood made our iOS roundup this week thanks to its iPhone version being upgraded to iPad. The same thing has happened on Android, with the app now native for tablets. It&apos;s all about mood-music: providing more than 100 playlists for moods and activities including calm, working, cooking, chill and optimistic. LooxcieLive This livestreaming app just graduated from beta on the Google Play store. It&apos;s for broadcasting live video from an Android device over 3G, 4G or Wi-Fi, while inviting friends to watch and text-chat. It works on an individual device, but can also be paired with one of Looxcie&apos;s standalone video cameras. Washington Post Social Reader US newspaper the Washington Post has launched its Social Reader app for Android, as part of the wider trend for newspapers (yes, this one included) to build Facebook into their digital offerings. In this case, the app pulls in news from the Post&apos;s own site as well as Slate, the Daily Beast, Mashable and others, while sharing details of articles read on the social network. Shape Be Your Best You US magazine Shape wants to help Android users &quot;look and feel amazing on the beach this summer&quot;. Yes, it&apos;s a bit late. This is a digital edition of the magazine offering workout plans, cardio routines and case studies. Chair Paging Clint Eastwood... Chair is a prototype app, interesting as much for the way it shows some of augmented reality technology&apos;s potential as for its one use: visualising what a room would look like with a chair in it. Its developer is using Qualcomm&apos;s Vuforia AR platform, which is picking up a head of steam in 2012. AudioPlayce Get beyond the mobile 2.0-speak (&quot;the social marketplace for geolocalized audioguides&quot;) and AudioPlayce is interesting: an app for recording your own audio-guides to cities around the world, and for accessing those recorded by other users. Badges and social features are included. Dan Deacon Also included in this week&apos;s iOS roundup, musician Dan Deacon&apos;s official app is designed to be used mainly during his live gigs. It &quot;synchronizes all the phones in the room, turning you and the rest of the audience into the light show and sound system for the concert&quot;. Elsewhere, it provides a virtual synthesizer instrument, and news about Deacon&apos;s activities.     PlayTo: Samsung TV transmits media to connected TVs    PlayTo: Samsung TV Looking to wirelessly pipe photos, videos and music from an Android device to a TV? There are numerous ways, depending on device and TV manufacturer. Dayglows&apos; new app focuses on Samsung TVs, and is able to play from websites including YouTube and Vevo, as well as tying into a number of on-demand TV services. InstaTalks Photo-sharing app Instagram is, obviously, about pictures rather than words. InstaTalks wants to provide a layer of words messages on top of all those filtered snaps though. Claiming to be &quot;the easiest and fastest way to chat with all your Instagram friends&quot;, it&apos;s a private messaging system for Instagram, with added location features to connect with nearby strangers. Flimby Plenty of apps have tried to be, in Flimby&apos;s words, an &quot;all-in-one social toolbox&quot;. The idea: a way to post to Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Flickr and Yammer from within one app. It also offers a &quot;Live Blast&quot; feature that promises shared web browsing with other people something that may well prove to be Flimby&apos;s trump card as it evolves, rather than the personal side of things. Teatime Another app to make both our iOS and Android roundups this week, the UK Tea Council&apos;s new app aims to solve office tea-making disputes. It creates &quot;tea groups&quot;, stores everyone&apos;s cuppa preferences, and then at pre-determined intervals picks a colleague at random to make the next round. Holo Music Player One of the interesting things about the Google Play store is the ability to dig deep and find some new and interesting betas. Holo Music Player is one of those: a Holo-themed music-player app with a heavy emphasis on swipe gestures to navigate around your music collection. That&apos;s our selection, now tell us yours. What Android apps have impressed you this week, and what do you think of those above? Post a comment and make your thoughts known.",

    "headline": "Research communication: building good university-media relationships", 
    "text": "I work for a media organisation but I must fess up: the media is as good at &apos;speaking truth to power&apos; as it is at inventing &apos;truths&apos;, exploiting our collective fear and perpetuating stereotypes. Guilty as charged. For those reasons of course  and others such as working on controversial research and a concern over a loss of credibility among peers  academics can be reticent about talking to the media. But as Fiona Fox, director of the Science Media Centre, writes in a report about science and the media, &quot;rightly or wrongly, some of the most important science debates of our times have been conducted on the front pages and in the headlines of the mainstream news  we ignore the mass media at our peril.&quot; On the surface, all higher education institutions have heeded those words. No university is without a press office, few do not have academics trained up as media experts, some are even proactive about informing the media about the availability of these experts to comment on issues as they arise. Still higher education and the media do not always make comfortable bedfellows. Melonie Fullick, a doctoral researcher at York University in Canada, has written a fair bit about the HE-media relationship. In one blogpost, she lists 10 recurrent themes covered by the media, which she describes as &quot;often ill-informed&quot;. She adds: &quot;While there are serious problems with some of the changes happening in universities, the debates that happen in the media don&apos;t necessarily contribute to public debate in a productive way.&quot; It would seem from bad science to bad policy, academia can  and is often  misrepresented. But as both Fullick and Fox say, the solution is not in returning to the &apos;knowledge castle&apos; and pulling up the drawbridge. Universities and the researchers who work in them must engage with the media, and must do so ... well, engagingly. So on Friday 31 August at 12 BST, we&apos;ll discuss how to build trust in university-media relationships, how to avoid an institution, individual or piece of research being misrepresented or misquoted and best practice in traditional and social media training for researchers and academics. The discussion will take place in the comment threads beneath this blog. To keep up with the debate on Twitter, follow the hashtag #HELiveChat.

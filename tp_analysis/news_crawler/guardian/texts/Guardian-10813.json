    "text": "Apple&apos;s latest iPhone will make its debut in China in December after receiving the final nod from the country&apos;s regulators. China is Apple&apos;s second-biggest market and the lack of a new model had eroded its share of smartphone sales in the country. The long wait for the iPhone 5, which was released in the US in September, caused Apple&apos;s Chinese market share to halve to 10% in the second quarter as consumers switched brands or patiently waited for the arrival of the latest model. Many users on Sina Weibo, China&apos;s most popular microblogging website, welcomed the imminent advent of the latest iPhone. &quot;I&apos;m all ready! The iPhone 5 is coming!&quot; said one. The chairman of China Unicom, the country&apos;s second-largest mobile carrier, said in November that the company expected to start selling the iPhone 5 this year. It aims for a big increase in 3G users to 100 million by the end of the year, from 67 million after the first nine months. The telecom regulatory authority, under China&apos;s ministry of industry and information technology, showed two iPhone 5 models on its website that received approval. The two are the A1429, which runs on China Unicom&apos;s network, and the A1442, which runs on China Telecom&apos;s network.",

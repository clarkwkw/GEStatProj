    "text": "Tom Davie, director of professional development, AGCAS (the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services) Careers professionals are having to be more flexible in their delivery of careers information, advice and guidance: There is still a place for the one-to-one as students expect and demand them but we can&apos;t reach our audience in just that narrow way. We have to be more proactive not only in our delivery to our students but also in our approach to academic colleagues. The strategic aims of our institutions are paramount to our success. Employability is about producing high-class employees but also citizens for the future, so integration of employability within the curriculum through skills development, closer engagement with issues such as internationalisation, research and the value of the extra-curricular activities that our students undertake show the value of education beyond the degree classification. To site good practice from a Durham perspective, we have broadened our remit and our careers team. We now have an employability development manager, an enterprise coordinator and a placement officer. We meet regularly with academic and college staff interested in the employability and enterprise agenda. We work closely with our students union sabbatical officers and run student focus groups to compliment our use of social media and networks including Twitter, blogs and Facebook. Ultimately, by being in collaboration with employers, alumni and entrepreneurs, we are enhancing the employability of the students that we serve - not just as a service but also as an institution. Universities have a role in offering work and opportunities to students: Part-time work is crucial not only to the financial stability of our students but also to their skills development, their commercial and entrepreneurial understanding. Linked to this, universities have a role in offering work to our students. A good example of how this can be done comes from my own institution where an MA student in museum studies has been researching the history (and writing articles) on one of our listed buildings. The experience is mutually beneficial as the student gets to develop skills that will increase her employability while we get something extremely valuable work done. What&apos;s in a name? There is an ongoing debate about what those who work in careers services should be called. Even the AGCAS Board has had to debate whether the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services accurately reflects the varying roles of our members. Lots of careers services have changed their name to accommodate their ever-broadening remit - both strategically and operationally. But where do you stop before you start looking like a very long railway station name in Wales and forgetting the purpose of what you are trying to achieve? Resource: AGCAS offers resources, discussion groups , conferences and training opportunities for careers services professionals. Charlie Ball is deputy director of research at HECSU, (Higher Education Careers Services Unit) which provides news and information about research and development in career-related learning and career guidance in HE There are a whole group of ideas we need to get away from. A couple of particularly unhelpful ones are:  The idea that you should have your &apos;dream&apos; job soon after completing your studies. Careers don&apos;t work that way. Most of us don&apos;t know what we want to do when we leave education and it&apos;s only through a process of experience and, to some extent, trial-and-error that we work out what suits us. The idea that young people should be expected to have made a life-defining decision that they&apos;re then locked into for the next 45 years - and that institutions have let them down if they haven&apos;t - is insidious and unhelpful  A related unhelpful careers idea is that graduates should be getting jobs &apos;related&apos; to the subject of their degree and that it&apos;s bad if they don&apos;t. It begs the question &apos;what do you mean by related?&apos; (says the bloke with a PhD in analytical chemistry who is pretty sure his research training is hugely valuable in his social research job), and more seriously, neglects that one of the real strengths of UK degrees is that they are extremely flexible and don&apos;t usually force people down narrowly-defined channels. It&apos;s no coincidence to my mind that broad, flexible degrees have fared rather better in the tighter labour market of the recession than narrower ones. Ruth Lawton, teaching fellow for employability, Birmingham City University Careers professionals must learn to speak the language of the age: Language is so important and is constantly changing: last year we talked skills, this year we talk attributes. I must admit to trying to find the right words for the person to whom I am talking. Though my underlying meaning remains the same, I adapt my language to meet their needs. Resource: In BCU&apos;s project, Creating future-proof graduates, one of the skills we focused on was networking and I created a board game which is available for all to download. Adam Powell, head of employability, Bath Spa University The Job Shop function is a really important part of the university employability offer: Enquiries about this kind of support feature heavily at open days. Some recent research by Kate Purcell revealed the differences that exist between universities in their student population&apos;s economic backgrounds and the level to which they worked part-time and undertook extra-curricular activities. We&apos;ve consciously increased the number of degree-related opportunities offered through our Job Shop, as these can often be equally as valuable as placements and internships - but we do still need to help students identify and articulate the many skills they gain. Elinor Edvardsson Stiwne, head of department, Linkoping University Center for Teaching and Learning Look at what is happening in other parts of the world, and recognise successes in your system: Coming from Sweden, where about 45% of students are enrolled in HE, where we have no tuition fees and where most students get grants and loans, in other words, where HE is still an opportunity for everybody, we still have one of the highest unemployment rates for young adults in Europe. At my university, career counselling is as issue that is very much left to special departments or professionals to deal with and there is an attitude among academic staff that this is not our business. My question is: have you in the UK managed to move on further from that attitude and integrate the work of different professionals in the common work of guiding and supporting students? If so, while still trying to solve the wider issues, you must celebrate that achievement. Stephen Boyd, head of the Careers and Employability Service, University of Huddersfield A greater policy focus on employability outcomes has increased attention on our role: For many careers services, the interest in employability has also meant an increase in the services&apos; profile within the university. A major challenge, that undoubtedly needs addressing in many universities, is the fact that many careers services are still positioned and resourced in a way that reflects the peripheral &apos;Cinderella&apos; services and this can be at odds with the high priority now placed on all things employability by the HEIs. Matthew Batstone, director, New College of the Humanities Institutions must find ways to get the most out of the varied group of professionals now interested in employability: I wonder what an employability professional is these days. When I took up my current role - a careers person moving into educational development and curriculum design - there were just a handful of people around the country to connect with. Two years ago I convened a meeting for &apos;employability developers&apos; and 30 people attended, there are now 330 plus people in the network; careers advisers, consultants, subject specialists and others. All of whom are interested in embedding employability in the curriculum. Institutions need to be able to find these people and make the most use of their skills to develop students.

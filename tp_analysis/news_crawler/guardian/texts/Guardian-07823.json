    "headline": "Heathrow's third runway meets fourth-party politics", 
    "text": "When I look south through my kitchen window I can often see a big jet flying up the Thames valley to Heathrow airport eight miles away. In clear blue sky the jets look lovely. But if I open the back door I can also hear them. Today I can also faintly hear David Cameron getting a raspberry from the proverbial &quot;senior Tory backbencher&quot; over the need to admit he was wrong about yet another coalition policy decision: airports. The language deployed is a bit fruity: are you a mouse or (wo)man, a feeble Harold Macmillan presiding over decay, or a bold Thatcher? asks Tim Yeo. It serves as yet another reminder that almost halfway through the 2010-15 parliament, with no sign of economic recovery, Tory MPs are starting to worry about the economic strategy most of them enthusiastically endorsed. Despite the imminence of a reshuffle Conservative backbenchers are getting a bit panicky about their seats. They are losing their fear of No 10. And that&apos;s dangerous. Just ask John Major what happened to his 1992-97 government after the pound&apos;s Black Wednesday exit from the embryonic single currency. Reckless with rage, his right wing, full-of-Thatcherite nostalgics destroyed the regime&apos;s residual authority. As a cabinet special adviser Cameron had a ringside seat. But his economic plight is more acute: in part the legacy of Thatcherism as practised by Gordon Brown. So is his political plight, which can also be traced to the more toxic components of the lady&apos;s mixed record, and her foolish espousal of increasingly anti-European policies, mostly after she left office in 1990. The result is that Ukip and fourth-party politics threaten to further undermine the fragile Tory hold on power. Today the battleground, both surrogate and real, is airports, where third runway and fourth party collide. I live about a mile north of the serious aircraft noise but the revived debate over the third runway is not an abstract one around here. It would be north of the airport&apos;s two existing runways  and our house would catch a lot more noise. Although the coalition partners supposedly killed off the Heathrow option in 2008-10, business leaders and other pro-growth campaigners have been chipping away at the decision. They claim  without much tangible evidence  that the chancellor, George Osborne, (the current focus of the Guardian&apos;s &quot;Sack George&quot; reshuffle poll) is coming around to their way of thinking as evidence mounts that Britain is losing Asian business  particularly rich Chinese tourists  to Schiphol, Frankfurt and Charles de Gaulle airports. The economics of hub airports, in which many passengers are merely in transit, are complicated. But there is little doubt that London&apos;s three airports (four including the City&apos;s mini-airport in Docklands) are insufficient to meet current demand, their reputation for delays, queues and other unpleasantness often being justified. The current excitement is provided by Yeo, to whom routine title inflation doesn&apos;t apply. He&apos;s 67 and has been MP for South Suffolk since 1983, a middling career which peaked as a junior environment minister under Major  until he was forced to resign after the usual tabloid love child story in January 1994. An amiable fellow, fond of golf and currently chairman of the Commons environment select committee, he&apos;s not the sort of MP I&apos;d expect to join a Daily Telegraph campaign and ask Cameron so publicly whether he&apos;s a &quot;man or mouse&quot; over the third runway. Shrewd ex-MP Paul Goodman agrees on ConservativeHome. Yeo&apos;s excuse for changing his mind on Heathrow is that big jets are now quieter and more fuel efficient and the EU is including aviation emissions in its range of pollution caps. &quot;We could cover the whole of Surrey with runways and not increase emissions by a single kilogram,&quot; he claims. Note that he offers Surrey, not Suffolk, for the experiment. Perhaps he&apos;s making a pre-emptive strike against Boris Island  the London&apos;s mayor&apos;s fantasy airport project on the Thames estuary (quite close to Suffolk for stacking purposes). Or maybe it&apos;s a diversionary tactic given that Yeo has been taking heat from Tory media  here&apos;s the Daily Mail and the Guido Fawkes blog  on the apparent conflict of interest between his green duties as an MP and the money (140,000 a year?) he makes from green interests. Either way Cameron is unlikely to be more than mildly irritated. Yeo is not a threat, he&apos;s a symptom. But so is the transport secretary, Justine Greening, who has popped up on air to sound tough about the third runway. Yet the effect of her interview with James Naughtie on Radio 4&apos;s Today programme was unconvincing. She kept talking about the need for bold, strategic decisions to resolve south-east England&apos;s airport problem instead of the &quot;piecemeal approach&quot; politicians have been forced to adopt for 50 years. (Why has the latter prevailed? Too many vested interests  not least Tory-voting Nimbys  and the parsimonious Treasury gang up to gridlock a decision.) As Greening re-invented an old policy wheel about consulting all parties, she sounded rather pleased with herself  though what she proposed has been going on since well before she was born in 1969. So Naughtie was right to press her on the test question. Given that her Putney constituents hate aircraft noise would she resign if Cameron changed policy? We&apos;re not going to change policy because it wouldn&apos;t be a full-length runway and so wouldn&apos;t solve the problem, Greening replied. But she repeatedly ducked the question, meaning that, if necessary, she would probably sit tight. Greening more or less implied that advocates of the third runway needn&apos;t bother contributing to her consultation because the facts haven&apos;t changed, a tactless and inaccurate suggestion. But the airport lobby won&apos;t take any notice because the coalition now has the appearance of a wobbly regime which can be pushed around. There&apos;s nothing wrong with a U-turn if executed with conviction and grace. Thatcher made some lovely ones, fast and forceful, that never damaged her authority. She only fell once she stopped doing them  and clung to the poll tax. As Cameron and Osborne enter a politically and economically scary autumn, they have more to worry about than transport strategy. Yet it matters because it has come to symbolise the courage and vision to tackle big projects that will make the country a greener, leaner, more civilised and efficient place to live. It can generate jobs and growth  votes too if ministers make the right call. This week Greening has stood up to Sir Richard Branson&apos;s familiar whinge about losing the west coast rail franchise to FirstGroup. Plenty of experts (and travellers) think FirstGroup has overbid and must fail. So she&apos;d better be right about better value for money if Cameron is to win seats in Lancashire next time. As for the HS2 high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham and beyond, it&apos;s big, bold and French, but I can&apos;t be persuaded of the economic case for such expense. The new line doesn&apos;t pass my door as Heathrow&apos;s new flight path would pass over it. It pains me to say so, but on economic grounds  and those of practical politics  I remain a third-runway man. But Greening&apos;s confidence and Cameron&apos;s steadfastness may just have taken into account Ukip&apos;s robust attitude towards the third runway. Ukip&apos;s leader, Nigel Farage, is proud to be the only British politician who is also a Freeman of the City of London. His &quot;Hillingdon Monster&quot; line is more populist than posh, but he&apos;s more likely to cause Cameron sleepless nights than Yeo.",

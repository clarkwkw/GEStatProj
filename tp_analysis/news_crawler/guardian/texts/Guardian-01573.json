    "text": "Equality is a principle that is pursued in many countries, though not universally achieved. Britain has over 40 years of legislation to protect and promote equality, yet today there remains a massive under-representation of women in public life, where 22% of MPs and one in eight FTSE 100 company directors are women. Maybe this is reflected in the way in which the prime minister, David Cameron, recently advised a female MP to &quot;calm down, dear&quot;. So what kinds of lives do men and women lead in the world reported in the Guardian Weekly? Unsurprisingly, and setting aside terms for national or religious identity, we find that both men and women are referred to as being: middle-aged, black, elderly, good, married, naked, older, ordinary, powerful and white. However, looking at adjectives that are used especially with men and women, we find that it is the men who are most often: armed, bearded, big, brave, dead, enlisted, gay, great, grown or hard, while women are: beautiful, educated, local, menopausal, modern, new, old or poor. It&apos;s a similar story for woman and man. Both are found with national terms and adjectives such as: young, black, white, elderly, aged, older, married, local and dead, but it&apos;s the woman who is old, first, pregnant, beautiful, new, wonder, pretty, unknown, well-dressed and real. Man, on the other hand, is found with: great, rich, right-hand, big, wanted, gay, innocent, free, sick, common and hard. Other gendered pairs tell an even more striking story. Thus, both husbands and wives are reported as being: late, dead, former, new, future, estranged and loving. However, it&apos;s the wives who are: pregnant, young, beautiful, battered, suffering, perfect, unhappy, favourite and wronged, while husbands are: violent, abusive, phantom, philandering, cuckolded or dangerous. But being a man isn&apos;t all fun. You may be big and brave  but you&apos;re also more likely to end up as reported dead than women. Despite this downside to masculinity, I&apos;m pretty sure that women would prefer not to be mainly commented on as being pretty or pregnant, battered or beautiful. Something for public figures to think about before their next off-the-cuff remark? Chris Tribble is a lecturer in applied linguistics at King&apos;s College London",

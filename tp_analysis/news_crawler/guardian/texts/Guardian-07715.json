    "text": "I&apos;ve been working in widening participation in east London since 2007, when Birkbeck began delivering programmes in Stratford, home to the Olympics but also the area of lowest higher education participation in London. Birkbeck, specialises in part-time higher education, delivered in the evening, and the majority of my work is aimed at widening participation among mature learners. Over the past five years, we have discovered that our mature, part-time learners face many boundaries, additional to those faced by 18-year-olds, to entering higher education, and we have developed different activities to help them overcome these. The latest of these initiatives are &apos;learning cafs&apos;, a five-week programme designed to fill the gap between our two hour information sessions about our higher education introductory studies certificate (a level 4 access course, for which we do not ask for previous qualifications) and the full programme, which many students went on to enrol on. We have always used the shorter outreach sessions as a useful way of raising awareness about our access courses and Birkbeck&apos;s model of evening teaching, which is very important for the majority of our students. At these sessions many students expressed enthusiasm for the HE introductory studies certificates but we found that one of two things often happened. Either, as it came nearer to the start of the course, confidence wavered and people would not enrol on the course, or they would enrol but at that point we (and they) would discover that they weren&apos;t quite ready for study. Thanks to our evening teaching the majority of our students are able to combine their studying with work or other daytime commitments. As an institution we used to supporting students with complicated situations as they juggle the demands of study and family and/or work. We are equally used to supporting people back into formal study after a gap of many years, or even decades. However, we found that more students than we would have liked were enrolling on the HE introductory studies without a full awareness of where their weaknesses lay, and once the course had started it was too late for many of them to start unpicking and addressing their needs. The learning cafs were our solution. The sessions were designed to build participants&apos; confidence, and to recognise how the skills they possess relate to university-level study and also to explore what different academic disciplines entail and help them to choose areas which match their interests and skills. For students who might not have studied in over 10 years, the sessions help them understand how things might have changed  particularly looking at the use of IT in study. It also means that the tutors can identify any students who will need additional support with IT or with their English language, and signpost them to places where they can address this need before they start their programme, giving them the best chance of success when they get there. The community setting means that the programme is accessible and non-threatening, and free childcare is provided during the session. Although we hold the learning cafs at children&apos;s centres the participants have not just been parents. Some have heard about them in the local press, via word-of-mouth or through the various community organisations that we partner with. The support from the children centre staff, libraries and other local organisations was invaluable and meant the learning cafs offer more than a one-off intervention, often giving participants access to more sustained long-term support. One of the joys of the scheme has been seeing the participants&apos; confidence grow over the five weeks. They arrive at the first session nervous and often unsure about whether they have the skills to complete the five-week programme, let alone a full higher education qualification. I particularly remember one student who arrived in week one clutching a torn out article about the learning cafs from the local paper and with a real anxiety that this would be &quot;another thing that she failed at&quot;. The first session unpacks students concerns and talks about how they can avoid their previous pitfalls. By week two the participant had somehow become a student, with a folder and notepad and a real determination to finish the programme. The transformation from one week to the next was incredible. I believe that for mature, non-traditional students providing this sort of outreach is vital to ensuring that they can hit the ground running when they arrive at their chosen institution. Our job is not just about getting students through our institution&apos;s doors  it&apos;s helping them make informed decisions about their next step, making sure that they arrive at a point where they are able to meet the challenges of higher education and complete their programme, particularly if they are combining it with other commitments. We are looking forward to seeing our learning caf participants progress onto our access courses  and well beyond.

    "text": "We recently ran a workshop, entitled &apos;Better conversations&apos;, at the two week Digital Shoreditch Festival, held in London&apos;s &apos;Tech City&apos;. The festival is celebration of the creative, technical and entrepreneurial talent that is part of the digital economy in that part of London, and our workshop explored the question of how businesses and universities can engage more effectively with each other to solve business problems. Around 80 participants, from both academia and industry, highlighted many of the issues that can make such communications difficult and provided innovative ideas on how academia and business could collaborate more effectively together. The challenges that surfaced include a lack of trust over issues such as intellectual property, uncertainty about the potential benefits of working together, and the difficulty on both sides of finding the time for initial exploratory conversations. Participants also noted an apparent disparity between universities and businesses in the kinds of outputs that would make such collaborations seem worthwhile. While businesses may be seeking saleable products, academics prize excellent research outputs and publications. There were concerns, particularly among small businesses, that universities may not find their problems interesting enough to address, and that they didn&apos;t know who to talk to, or find out if a university could help them solve their business challenges. Though industry-academic collaborations can be challenging, the benefits certainly outweigh the risks. Pfizer and University of California San Diego have created teams of university and industry scientists that combine the best academic thinking with the drug development expertise of industry to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients. A recent collaboration agreement between GlaxoSmithKline and the University of Cambridge puts academic scientists into the laboratories on the GSK campus in Stevenage - certainly a sign that UK industry see the potential of increased collaboration. Benefits extend beyond the partnerships themselves. University-industry collaborations have delivered innovative commercial products. Professor Achim Kampker of Aachen University leads a consortium of over 50 companies that have designed and built a cheap, modular electric vehicle called the StreetScooter. The first cars hit the streets in June this year. It goes into full production in 2013 and DHL have pre-ordered 3500. That is commercial success facilitated by academic skills and inputs. And other examples abound, like Raven the surgical robot, a result of a collaboration between the Universities of Washington and California Santa Cruz, robot manufacturers and computer games companies. There are case studies closer to home but also on display at Digital Shoreditch were some of the services that universities can offer to businesses, such as the Interaction Lab at City that was set up with funding from the Vodafone Foundation. The university benefits, not only because supporting clients of the Lab provides valuable experience for students in working in real business situations, but also because businesses can see immediate and tangible advantages to working with the Lab, and some of the contacts made in this way turn into longer term research collaborations, for example in the form of Knowledge Transfer Partnerships. However, it&apos;s one thing knowing that collaboration can be mutually beneficial and another finding out how to make more effective collaborations happen. Ideas mooted at the workshop included a single &apos;who you gonna call&apos; phone number that businesses could ring to find the right person to talk to, or a &apos;dating agency&apos; that could help pair up academics and business people with complementary interests and needs. &apos;Sandboxes&apos; that allow groups to focus on and experiment with ideas without fear of failure, or a permanent &apos;caf culture&apos; where academics and business people alike can drop in at any time and be sure of finding someone with common interests to bounce ideas off. &apos;Jams&apos;, that extend the idea of hack days beyond just software coding, were also proposed. They could include opportunity identification, design, prototyping of software, physical prototypes, business models, or even the creation of start up companies. There is also a role for incubators to do more than rent desk space to companies. They should provide networking opportunities, access to the academic ecosystem, opportunities to learn, pitch for business funding and get advice from established entrepreneurs. These ideas and more will now be forwarded to Knowledge London, the London network of knowledge transfer professionals, university incubators and other organisations that can take them forward. Our aim is to facilitate more frequent, more diverse and more effective conversations between universities and businesses to the mutual benefit of all participants. We can&apos;t shy away from the challenges or fail to acknowledge the significant costs to many of the ideas above. For any of this to happen and succeed, senior management buy-in will be required. But the fact of the matter remains that collaborations provide stretching intellectual challenges, can enhance reputations and potential revenue streams for universities but these benefits are only available to those who are able to seize these opportunities.

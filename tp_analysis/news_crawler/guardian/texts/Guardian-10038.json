    "text": "Recently the UK&apos;s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has been consulting on its Science and Society programme, and I for one have fed my thoughts back to their team. On their web pages they also detail the progress they have made against previous objectives, set up a couple of years ago. Progress on some fronts is good, particularly in the way interactions with the media are progressing. Nevertheless, there are hints in the text implying unhealthy mental separation of different groupings. For example, language relating to how &quot;we&quot;, that is the scientists, are expected to engage with &quot;you&quot;, the public, might perhaps benefit from closer scrutiny. There are also some notable omissions of people who don&apos;t seem to be expected to participate in engagement very much at all, notably &quot;them&quot; - those who set the agenda at the centre of power, comprising MP&apos;s, civil servants and policy-makers in general. Before I return to considering why I think their omission is so important, let me just say a few words about a couple of the objectives listed in their consultation document. The first one says  The value of public investment in science and innovation and their contribution to economic and societal well-being is widely recognised.  Value is a loaded word. It too readily smacks of economic value, particularly when juxtaposed with words like investment. It could be interpreted more widely than that and may well have been intended to encompass a range of other connotations. However, scientists themselves may be chary of a word like &quot;value&quot;. Using this word right at the start raises the danger of alarm bells being set off for scientists who believe the benefits of their work extend far more broadly than on purely economic grounds. For instance, the public engagement agenda that sits at the heart of the BIS consultation document implies a value that is hard to put a pound sign against, but is none the less real for this. This sort of engagement is of course at the heart of this document, but even so, looking at the last of the 6 objectives, I detect a slightly patronising view of it:  Scientists better at communicating and engaging with the public.  Personally, this reads rather like a school report describing some naughty pupil, rather than text acknowledging that maybe many scientists actually do a pretty good job of it already. I would prefer any statement referring to performance in this area to recognize that, at the very least, there are pockets of excellence well and truly established. A better worded objective would give a sense of encouragement, by implying that scientists should continue to improve in how they engage with the public, not by implication chastising us all for being tucked up in our little ivory tower silos. We&apos;re not perfect, and some clearly and regrettably don&apos;t engage at all, but things have progressed in the right direction over the recent past. This can be seen from the increasing numbers of individuals, at all levels of seniority, who participate in Science Festivals across the country, as I and many of my Cambridge colleagues do in our own annual Festival. Beneath the list of objectives, there is a similar list of what success will look like referring to the media, employers and industry, for instance. But the text is silent on &apos;them&apos;, the policy makers. They are not asked to improve their engagement with scientists, nor heed scientific evidence under the list of objectives. Neither does &apos;success&apos; seem to involve them. No aspiration that policy will be based on scientific advice and evidence, nor that the Civil Service will become a destination of choice for fresh graduates. No sense that science should and indeed does permeate many ministries beyond BIS, and that some cross-ministry joined-up thinking around policy involving science might be beneficial  dare I say have value for  the country. You only have to think about the muddled mess involving the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) that represents the on-again/off-again badger cull to realise that critical weighing of evidence, so crucial to scientific activities, does not sit centre stage when it comes to policy. Civil servants who write policy documents across the board only too rarely have formal scientific training. Nor does success, according to BIS, contain any mention of the suggestion, made by Adam Afriyie (then shadow Science Minister) before the last election, that MPs should get remedial science lessons. To quote my own MP and erstwhile colleague in Physics at the University of Cambridge, Dr Julian Huppert shortly after election as an MP in 2010, who said  propos of this:  &quot;It would be really important for all MPs to have some exposure, because some of them will not have studied any science since they were 15 and it&apos;s important to understand how to engage with it. You would then have a lot of MPs who were able to understand the information they were being presented with.&quot;  I would urge the powers-that-be to think more about the role that policy-makers have when it comes to contributing to what BIS headlines as &quot;Our vision is of a UK which values the contribution of science to culture, society and sustainable economic development and growth.&quot; It isn&apos;t just about &quot;us&quot; the scientists.",

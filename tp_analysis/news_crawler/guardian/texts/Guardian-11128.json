    "text": "Full of berry, the hawthorn&apos;s splash of red is the brightest thing on Windmill Hill. Why it&apos;s so loaded with berries, why they&apos;re so brightly red and why they haven&apos;t all been stripped by birds yet is a mystery. What is even more mysterious is that the tree appears to be singing. From inside its wind-twisted tangle come little chaffinchy songs, subdued chimings like side-of-the-mouth gossip. Blackbirds and redwings come for the berries but they only take a few and there&apos;s no all-out plunder yet. Maybe they&apos;re waiting for another spike of frost to perfect the fruit or maybe the tree has a kind of power over the birds and is not ready to deliver its promise. Inside each pillar-box-red haw are seeds in which the last year is folded like a bus ticket to the next. How many years this tree has been doing this is hard to tell. It has aluminium-grey- and brass-coloured lichens, green tufts of moss and old riven bark. It seems small to be of any great age but it struggles out of limestone with no soil to speak of and its character has been shaped by adversity and exposure. This tree certainly has presence, and blue tits, wrens and dunnocks hide in it, out of the way of winds and the vast, uncompromising world that could crush them with its gaze. They make their own secret sounds which play into the tree&apos;s plainsong. On a day of cold sunshine, which has opened up the hill and the knapweed seedheads, the hawthorn is brilliant but there&apos;s a kind of melancholy about it. It&apos;s as if the tree&apos;s fecundity is a last-ditch attempt to throw itself out of its nailed-down place to pitch its future into the world through the innards of the birds. The hawthorn&apos;s blood red is also an omen, a signal for the 12th day of the 12th month of the 12th year.",

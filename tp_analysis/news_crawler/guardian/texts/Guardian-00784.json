We&apos;re the UK&apos;s leading home improvement and garden centre retailer, with a strong heritage in sustainability and are committed to being a responsible retailer. We&apos;ve been significantly reducing our own environmental impact and helping our customers to reduce theirs through our One Planet Home product range and our partnership with sustainability charity, Bioregional. In 2011 we were delighted to be able to announce that the timber in all our products is now sustainably sourced and we launched our Forest Friendly campaign to encourage consumers to question the source of timber in products before they buy  www.diy.com/forestfriendly  We&apos;re also a founding partner to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and are currently exploring how we might move our business model to a closed loop one. We&apos;re looking at how we might re-think and re-design the way we do things to secure a sustainable future. We&apos;ve made some encouraging progress this year and have appointed a Youth Board to give us a fresh perspective and help us with the challenge  www.diy.com/youthboard  We&apos;re delighted to be a part of these prestigious awards and sponsoring Campaigner of the Year. You can really make somone&apos;s year by voting to recognise the great work they&apos;ve been doing.",

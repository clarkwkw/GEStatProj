    "text": "It was in 2007 that I first went to the Carymarsh wetland and nature reserve created from farmland on clay soil below Castle Cary, just two metres above sea level, and almost into the territory recognised as the Somerset Levels. At that time the reserve was newly devised by the family that had farmed the land for generations. I was returning to see how their scheme of banks, plantings and diverted channels, intended to re-create the environment and habitat that had existed before intensive farming, had survived the recent weather. You needed boots to manage the frequent and deep puddles on the old drove road that leads to the reserve, and beyond the hedge a great volume of water was surging through a channel made by the thorough clearance of a wide, deep, man-made irrigation ditch  part of the levels drainage system. But I was told that alternate spells of drought and flood in recent years had turned the land successively into concrete and lake. Originally, 4,500 trees  field maple, ash, willow and black poplar, with hawthorn, blackthorn and hazel along field margins  had been planted to make a true native woodland. Now, all but 1,500 of the plastic tree-guards housing the saplings were empty. The rough grassland was drenched, so the population of small rodents was diminished. Although this makes the place less attractive to barn owls, they have not abandoned it. We spotted the wide, pale-coloured wings of one gliding towards a hedge as we were leaving. There is now a fine hide for observers, from which we saw at once a remarkable starling display. These birds, in their great numbers, do damage on farms, where they eat or soil precious grain feed, but the sight of their swarms, swooping and wheeling in constantly changing patterns against the sky, remains a seasonal marvel.",

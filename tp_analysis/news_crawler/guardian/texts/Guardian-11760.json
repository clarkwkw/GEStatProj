    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view The fundamental problem with Microsoft&apos;s motion-detecting Kinect peripheral is that it&apos;s not very good at detecting movement. In games that demand subtle or directional actions, you start to feel like someone trying to communicate with a blind man using semaphore. Sesame Street TV is the first Kinect title to bypass these problems altogether. It does so by being nice and simple, requiring its diminutive audience to jump, throw invisible balls with both hands and generally make great big movements, which the device has absolutely no trouble seeing. Astutely, it doesn&apos;t try and shoehorn Kinect into everything it does, reserving it for a few occasions in each episode, which keeps things fresh. That helps to create charming, interactive television, that mixes entertainment with learning and a bit of leaping about.",

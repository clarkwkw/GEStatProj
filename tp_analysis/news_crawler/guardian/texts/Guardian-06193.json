    "text": "While the water looked flat, calm and mirrored the surrounding trees, there was plenty of activity among the water birds. In front of me a coot was diving, seeking submerged plants and then bobbing to the surface almost like a cork, its brilliant white frontal shield above its beak giving rise to the expression &quot;bald as a coot&quot;. In contrast, the three little grebes were fighting as only these tiny grebes can. One was diving and then coming up from under another while the third was fighting both of them. All the time their piercing, trilling notes echoed across the water. The single Slavonian grebe seemed to be aloof from such boisterous antics as it swam close by, as if aware of its magnificent plumage. There was a commotion near a sedge bed and a brood of well-grown mallard ducklings seemed to have fallen out over something while the mother looked on as if amused by the antics. Male tufted ducks looked conspicuous in their striking black and white plumage as they too were diving for food. In contrast to all this activity the mute swans looked regal, almost superior, as they swam over the middle of the loch. The cob was in front, as if he was proud and leading the way. The pen was behind with the brood of cygnets, still in their brown plumage, following her. All were line astern as if intent on reaching the far bank. But at last there was the bird I had come to see  a moorhen. This delightful creature is uncommon to scarce in the Highlands and is one of my favourites. The bird was swimming along the edge of a dark green dense bed of bog bean that reached well out from the shore. To me the moorhen is amusing with its perpetual jerky movement of its head as it swims or walks, so how fitting that the Gaelic name for this bird is cearc uisge meaning &quot;hen of the water&quot;.",

    "text": "I&apos;d been living with the expectation of The Phone Call for some months and had been nervously eyeing the clock every day around noon. However, when the call finally came, I was just trying to calm a child in my office who had been having a huge, violent tantrum in the hallway. Still breathless from carrying him, I picked up the phone and heard the fateful words: &quot;Inspector for you&quot;. Under the new Ofsted framework, the call is now from the lead inspector herself. There is no time for gathering oneself together. That&apos;s it. She is on the phone. It requires a level of composure that I don&apos;t always have, but somehow, I managed to hold a sensible conversation. This consisted simply of the practical arrangements for the inspection, which would start the next day. My staff soon adopted a &quot;bring it on&quot; attitude. Outside, so did I. Inside, I was quaking. I know our strengths, but I also know what we still need to improve. On the way back to my office, I saw my deputy head struggling up the corridor with the boy, and looking anxious. He had been attacking children in our support group, punching them, kicking and biting, tearing paper off the walls and throwing things at everyone. Together we managed to get him into my office and were able to let go of him as he was now contained. He started pulling everything off the walls and pushing furniture over. Then he opened my cupboard, grabbed a pot of yellow glitter, pulled the lid off and started throwing it everywhere, and on us. How to deal with this when I needed to get so much done for the inspection and I could not even get near my computer? The boy started to swear. He then, quite deliberately, kicked my deputy head in the stomach. He moved so fast that we were not quick enough to stop him. Later, when his mother came to pick him up, she insisted that he clean up the mess on the floor. As she passed the hoover to him, he flin ched in a way that made my colleague and me shiver as we exchanged glances. But his behaviour had been so extreme and violent that I had no choice but to exclude him, and so I arranged for him to attend our local pupil referral unit for a couple of weeks. It was an hour and a half before we could get on with preparations for the inspection. I don&apos;t always manage well under this sort of pressure: the flight response is very strong in me and my adrenaline levels rocket. Just like some of the children we are supporting. We started to collate all the information needed. Staff were ensuring that their planning was good and that their rooms were tidy. We left school at 11pm. Usually the anticipation of an event is worse than the event itself. This is not my experience of Ofsted inspections. This is my fifth full inspection as a head and still my anxiety levels are high each time. I didn&apos;t sleep that night. There were two inspectors in the team, and a trainee. First part of the inspection process, after the initial meeting, was joint lesson observations. A good start. This was followed by a team meeting. But it soon became clear that the view they were forming of the school was one that was very different from the reality. I had to struggle to hold it together. I couldn&apos;t quite believe what they were saying. Another sleepless night, this time sobbing, fearing everything I had fought so hard for was slipping through my fingers. On day two, I asked the lead inspector for a meeting to express a concern that I was developing about the conduct of the inspection. She was actually very sympathetic at this point and the attidude and feel of the inspection seemed to change. In the next few meetings, we bombarded them with evidence and eventually it seemed that they were listening and taking on board our self-evaluation. In the next team meeting, the inspectors had read my behaviour logs and risk assessments and they began to develop a better understanding of just how many socio-economic and emotional barriers to learning we have to overcome in this particular primary school for our children to make progress. I was still pacing the corridors. My staff and the children were magnificent. The children really impressed the inspectors, as did my senior leadership team. But the last meeting, to discuss the final judgments, was difficult. Under the new framework, you are allowed to be a part of the discussion, which is much better than before. I tried to argue, backed up by myriad evidence, against one of the judgments, but I could not budge them. The verdict was to be that  like many schools in this latest round of inspections  we &quot;require improvement&quot;, but we were given &quot;good&quot; for leadership and management and also for behaviour and safety, which is a real credit to the staff. The hardest part of any inspection in some ways is the days that follow, with all the staff feeling shellshocked and exhausted. I could hardly string a sentence together. We are left dazed and battered in their wake. And in the midst of all of this, a tragedy was unfolding. One of our parents was critically ill in hospital and we had just found out that they might not recover. We are supporting the child as best we can, but it&apos;s hard, when everyone is so emotional at the moment, not to just sit and sob at the futility of it all. Things, however, have to go on as normal and we have been soothed by the ethereal sound of children&apos;s voices floating through the corrridors as they practise for our carol concert. We are OK, my school and me, and we will do anything it takes to get the best for our children.  Bergistra&apos;s blog is at http://themusingsofaheadteacher.wordpress.com/author/bergistra/",

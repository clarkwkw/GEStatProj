For me, the key is doing all my shifts on Fridays and Saturdays, so the week is free for study and I still earn a good wage. I don&apos;t feel I miss out on anything because most students don&apos;t go out at the weekend  far tooexpensive!&quot;      Photograph: Guardian    Paul Holmes, BA in journalism and broadcasting, University of Salford &quot;As a mature student with experience in retail management, it was quite easy for me to find work at university. I work for a mobile phone network. My managers are very accommodating and don&apos;t mind rearranging my shifts when my timetable changes. The only downside I&apos;ve found to working part time is that it makes it difficult to fit in unpaid workplacements.&quot;      Photograph: Sam Atkins for the Guardian    Katie Rhodes, BAin history, University of York  &quot;In the second year I got a transfer from the Tesco branch at home to one close to university. There were lots of students working there, and the management were great about us fitting work around our timetables and holidays. In the third year, I was able to cut the shifts down and then increase them again after my exams.

I&apos;m never under an obligation to work if I don&apos;t have the time, but I can assist on open days when they fit around my timetable.

It was quite a high-pressure working culture, but it helped me stay on-track. If you only spend time with other students, you can start to lose your focus. Being in a work environment helped me maintain perspective.&quot;      Photograph: Guardian    Nicholas Dunn-McAfee, BA English and related literature, University of York  &quot;I work for a courier, handling customer complaints via email. The role is remote, so I can work shifts from anywhere. I can complete my set number of hours for a day at any time, so it fits easily around my degree. If it weren&apos;t for all the abusive emails I have to answer, it would be the perfect student job!&quot;",

    "text": "You can tell a lot about a politician&apos;s priorities from who they deign to follow on Twitter. When David Cameron joined the service on Saturday, hestarted out following just three people: Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt and William Hague. Not, one suspects, because those are his three best buddies, but perhaps because those are the people he simply couldn&apos;t be seen to have snubbed. If a person&apos;s &quot;following&quot; list is the new window to their soul, then the 30 people the PM has since added tell us quite a lot about him: every single one is a Tory MP. Meanwhile, fellow Twitter newcomer Maria Miller, who replaced Jeremy Hunt as secretary of state for culture, media and sport, has already been bombarded with retweets of the question, first posed by arts producer Danielle Rose, &quot;Dear @Maria_MillerMP, why do you not follow any artists, small to medium arts organisations, festivals, or human rights organisations?&quot; Miller, to be fair, is now following more museums, galleries and charities than her predecessor in the role; of the 103 people Hunt follows, almost all are either politicians or political journalists. There are just two spots reserved for cultural types, which go to Stephen Fry and Kevin Spacey, who Hunt presumably felt would give him all the information on the arts he&apos;d ever need. The undisputed king of Twitter failure, however, has got to be online popularity guru Grant Shapps. The Conservative party chairman follows, at time of writing, 23,226 people, including several hundred users tweeting exclusively in foreign languages. Too many tweets may make you appear a twat, Grant, but too much following just makes you look creepy. On the other side of the floor, Labour leader Ed Miliband follows 1,244 people, ranging from Barack Obama to Boris Becker, though on close examination the list doesn&apos;t quite ring true. Is he really, for example, an avid devotee of the wisdom of Gary Barlow? Are we honestly to believe that the geekiest party leader since Neil Kinnock keeps doggedly up-to-date with the goings-on of Team Lorraine Kelly? Does any adult in their right mind need to be following two separate accounts for Vanessa Feltz? The political robot doth protest too much. The lesson here? Be human, but not too human. And above all, don&apos;t be Grant Shapps.",

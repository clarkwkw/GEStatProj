    "text": "The 3DS XL will be out in a couple of weeks. I will be buying it, like the sucker I am. Not because I&apos;ll buy just about anything with Nintendo on it  although I do have a Game Boy Micro, so that would probably be a fair accusation  but because I adore my 3DS, and I want a better, prettier one. A lot of people will tell you that the era of the handheld games console is over, but these eccentric devices and their diverse, often fascinatingly bizarre games have been a love affair for me since I was pint-sized myself. My love for handheld gaming began when I was 10 and was given a Game Boy Color as a reward for an excellent school year. This was a monumental occurrence in my young life, mostly because I had spent the previous three entire years lobbying my long-suffering, video game-fearing parents for a Game Boy, which is a heck of a long time for a 10-year-old. Given my fascination with our tightly-controlled family SNES, which I was permitted to play only on Fridays and Saturdays, I presume they feared that if I got a games console I could carry around with me, I&apos;d never do anything else. If they were worried about that, they probably shouldn&apos;t have got me Pokemon with it. Pokemon Red and Blue are two of the best games ever made on any console; they&apos;re empowering, deeply involving, astonishingly forward-thinking for their time. They were a total obsession. So was Tetris. My brother and I used to have protracted score wars where he wouldn&apos;t relinquish the console until he&apos;d topped every single high-score table, and I wouldn&apos;t give it back to him until the situation was reversed. It wasn&apos;t too long before the Game Boy Advance was out  and boy, what a console that was. It brought a whole generation of SNES-era classics to my teenaged attention. I played Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town, a gentle and dangerously addictive farming-life simulator, for probably about 200 hours. It also had Wario Ware, the most loopily creative game that Nintendo has ever made  a crazy collection of mechanically perfect one-shot miniature gamelets that encapsulate many of the things I love about video games in five seconds or less. I still play it now. As an adult, I still do probably half my gaming on handhelds. My years-long Monster Hunter habit, picked up in 2006 and worsened considerably by a move to Japan in 2008, kept my PSP in my pocket where others were shut away in drawers, attracting thin films of dust to their impressive screens. In the early days of the Nintendo DS, when it was still an ugly grey plastic sandwich, I played everything from weird dating mini-games to eight-player rhythm action music toys to haunting, lonely point-and-click adventures and touching desert-island survival simulators. I played a bonkers, effusively soundtracked Japanese cheerleading game with a ghost love story that, no joke, made me cry. It was a great time, that DS launch period, before the console found massive success and suddenly every other game was babysitting-themed shovelware. There was such creativity. It might not be such a fecund period now, but the Vita and 3DS still have a lot to offer me. I was recently enraptured with Velocity, a creative little PlayStation Mini vertical shooter that made my miss my tube stop twice. I&apos;ve got a pretty intimidating (if long-neglected) Nintendogs save file. I played all the way through The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D in a state of nostalgic ecstasy. I got properly into Mario Kart again for the first time since  well, Super Circuit on the Game Boy Advance. So many of my favourite games are ones made for handhelds. It&apos;s weird, really, that this affection hasn&apos;t translated into a love of mobile gaming (not yet, at least)  but I think that&apos;s mostly because I don&apos;t own any iOS devices, preferring to spend my money in smaller increments on sustenance and miniature plastic stuff than all at once on ludicrously expensive shiny gadgets. But I think it&apos;s also because, in my professedly limited experience, mobile games just don&apos;t offer the same kinds of experience as handheld games. There&apos;s just not the same time or money behind them. Nothing I&apos;ve yet played on a phone has convinced me otherwise. I look forward to the day that changes. For now, though, I&apos;ll pay my money and play Luigi&apos;s Mansion 2 and Animal Crossing (again) on a 90% larger screen. And I&apos;ll enjoy myself, dammit.

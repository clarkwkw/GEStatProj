    "text": "How much do you want Google to know about you?  On 1 March, the company will institute new &quot;privacy policies&quot; that will add substantial detail to the picture Google keeps of each user.  Under the new rules the company will keep track of what you search for and how you use products like Google+, Gmail and YouTube. The information will be used, Google says, to &quot;do things like suggest search queries  or tailor your search results  based on the interests you&apos;ve expressed&quot;.  Not comfortable with the idea of coming face-to-face with your web history every time you fire up your browser? (I could have been looking for Hannukah, hanging chad or handbrake  why does it assume hangover cure?) Here are five simple steps for keeping what you do on Google a little more private. 1) Don&apos;t use Google. There are other search engines out there  and other email platforms  and none is so ambitious as Google about figuring out who you are, what you like and what you&apos;re like. Unfortunately, none are quite as good at what Google does either. 2) Don&apos;t sign in. Or sign out of your Google account when you&apos;re not actively using Gmail, Google Calendar or Panoramio. (Let&apos;s face it: you&apos;ve been spending way, way too much time on Panoramio). And when you sign back in, uncheck the &quot;stay signed in&quot; box. 3) Change your settings. Look at the upper right-hand corner of your browser. See your Gmail address? Click it. A drop-down menu appears. Click &quot;account settings.&quot; Scroll down to &quot;services.&quot; Click &quot;Go to web history.&quot; It will read: &quot;Web history makes searches better.&quot; Click &quot;No, thanks.&quot; You can also clear your web history from this screen. The same trick can be accomplished here. 4) Use Google Chrome&apos;s &quot;Incognito Mode,&quot; or another private browsing mode. Don&apos;t be misled by the Incognito Mode icon, though. Simply wearing a trenchcoat, shades and a fedora while you browse will not keep your session private. Your computer won&apos;t collect cookies or record your online travels, but your server (or your company&apos;s server) will. 5) Don&apos;t Google yourself. Difficult advice to follow, we understand, and it&apos;s more a general online privacy guideline than a step to rein in Google. But repeated searches for your name or personal information such as your address can create a virtual map that leads right to you.",

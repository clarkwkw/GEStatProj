    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view In 2084, 99% of the population upload their memories to be shared with others over a network controlled by the evil mega-corp Memorize. You&apos;re an &quot;errorist&quot;, one of the refusenik 1%, but with the unique ability to reach in and tinker with people&apos;s memories, changing the minutiae until you discover the right combination of factors to shift their entire perspective on life. As you explore the extraordinarily beautiful rooftops, sewers and inevitable underground laboratories of Blade Runner-meets-Fifth Element Neo-Paris, you&apos;re given opportunities to change the minds of powerful antagonists by remixing their memories. Most of the time, though, you&apos;ll be kung fu-ing robotic and human henchmen using the game&apos;s customisable combos overlaid with targeted special moves. Fights are challenging but rarely unfair (and that includes the game&apos;s super-epic boss battles) but it&apos;s not entirely successful, with combat eventually becoming repetitive and your infrequent opportunities to remix memories relying entirely on trial and error.",

    "text": "Britain&apos;s three exam boards are facing an unprecedented number of appeals over this year&apos;s GCSE results, after claims that some candidates have been unfairly marked down in an effort to curb grade inflation. Headteachers said a decision to raise grade boundaries in GCSE English between exams taken in January and June resulted in many teenagers in effect being marked down an entire grade, leaving public confidence in the exam system in jeopardy. More than 100 individual schools contacted the Guardian with details of the problems they were experiencing, describing the effect as &quot;demoralising&quot;, &quot;soul-destroying&quot; and &quot;gutting&quot; for students and staff. Michael Gove, the education secretary, insisted that the changes were comparable with previous years. Concerns from the schools were confirmed in the national results, which showed that the numbers getting grades A* to C fell for the first time in the GCSE&apos;s 26-year history, with the proportion of English entries achieving a good pass dropping by 1.5 percentage points. GCSE grades are essential for many pupils to secure a college place and are increasingly considered in university applications, meaning thousands of affected students are likely to appeal against their results. Good grades in English are also crucial for schools, which face being closed or converted into academies if results fall below government targets.     GCSE results Photograph: Graphic    Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: &quot;What appears to have happened is that, halfway through the year, it was decided that too many students were going to get a C grade in English and the grade boundaries of the exam were pushed up very substantially. It is morally wrong to manipulate exam grades in this way  you are playing with young people&apos;s futures.&quot; Gove defended the results, saying: &quot;You cannot have a situation where exam passes continue rising forever and ever without there being in some subjects at some points grades either falling or steadying or changing  it&apos;s just in the nature of things that inevitably there will be alterations.&quot; Asked about concerns from English teachers that exams in their subject have been marked too harshly, he said: &quot;Yes, the number of As and A*s has fallen, but the number of Bs has increased, the number of Cs has fallen and the number of Ds has increased. That is a result of the independent judgments made by exam boards entirely free from any political pressure,&quot; he told the BBC. Asked if he would like to see the revival of O-levels, he appeared to row back from previous plans to reintroduce them along with a second qualification based on the CSE, which lower ability students typically sat, saying instead he would like to see GCSEs reformed. A government source insisted there was no question of results being manipulated to force schools to convert into academies. &quot;We don&apos;t need a backdoor way of making schools academies  already half of secondaries are academies coming through the front door,&quot; he said. But Labour called for a better explanation of what had gone wrong. The shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg, said: &quot;Michael Gove needs to take responsibility for the exam system and not just pass the buck. &quot;There have been extremely serious concerns raised today about the marking of English GCSEs. &quot;If pupils from the same year group have been marked more harshly if they were entered later, that is patently unfair. We need to understand why some pupils&apos; grades have fallen so dramatically. &quot;If we are to restore confidence in the exam system there needs to be a full inquiry into what happened by the Education Select Committee. &quot;The exam system should be rigorous but it must also be fair to all students.&quot; The erratic results appear to have followed an order from the exams watchdog, Ofqual, to ensure that they are broadly comparable to previous years as well as the introduction of new English GCSE courses for the first time this year. The results also showed that the decline in the study of modern foreign languages appears to be slowing. Entries for French fell by 0.5%, compared with a 13.2% fall last year, and entries for German fell by 5.5% compared with a 13.2% fall in 2011. Examiners suggested a rise in the number of students taking traditional subjects such as history and geography was due to the English baccalaureate, introduced by the government at the end of 2010 to recognise achievement in English, maths, science, a foreign language and history or geography. Around 658,000 16-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland received their results on Thursday. They showed that in maths, 58.4% of entries got at least a C grade, down from 58.8% in 2011, and 15.4% got A*-A, compared with 16.5% last summer. In science, 60.7% got A*-C grades, down from 62.9% and 9.8% got A*-A, down from 11.6% in 2011. Girls have significantly outperformed boys at A*, with 8.7% of girls&apos; entries achieving this grade compared with 6% of boys. Girls have also outperformed boys in terms of grades at A*-C. In biology, physics and chemistry girls outperform their male classmates at A* and A grades even though more boys than girls take these subjects. The 10 most popular subjects, in order, were mathematics, English, science, English literature, additional science, design and technology, religious studies, history, geography, and art and design.",

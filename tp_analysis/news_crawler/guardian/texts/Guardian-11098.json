    "text": "  5.47pm GMT    My verdict    My views on shale gas have not materially changed since I last examined the environmental impacts of fracking back in May. I&apos;m not against it per se - I believe it can be part of the UK&apos;s energy mix, if it helps us to relinquish coal - but I do think we need to proceed with caution. I am, therefore, pleased to see in today&apos;s announcement by the UK government that in allowing the resumption of test drilling in Lancashire it can only do so with tight oversight and regulation. It appears obvious that we are still many years away from reaching the stage where shale gas is exploited commercially in the UK - and even when, or if, that moment arrives it will unlikely ever be on the scale seen in the US. Those that try to directly compare the US situation to the UK are, in large part, misinforming this important debate. There appear to be far more differences than similarities, in my view. An important next step after the excitement and anger that has greeted today&apos;s new is to establish much more information about precisely how much shale gas is recoverable. Until we do so, this debate will continue to be hindered by a fug of contradiction and confusion. And then we must digest the all-important report commissioned today by Decc that will examine the full carbon life-cycle of shale gas. What the government does with that information will present a far bigger decision than it has made today.       5.18pm GMT       As I referenced back in May when I last examined shale gas in the Eco Audit, it&apos;s worth recalling the report on shale gas published by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in January 2011 and updated late last year:  Irrespective of whether UK shale gas substitutes for coal, renewables or imported gas, the industry&apos;s latest reserve estimates for just one licence area could account for up to 15% of the UK&apos;s emissions budget through to 2050. Therefore, emissions from a fully developed UK shale gas industry would likely be very substantial in their own right. If the UK government is to respect its obligations under both the Copenhagen accord and low carbon transition plan, shale gas offers no meaningful potential as even a transition fuel. Moreover, any significant and early development of the industry is likely to prove either economically unwise or risk jeopardising the UK&apos;s international reputation on climate change. Against such a quantifiable and stark evaluation, it is difficult to conclude other than the UK needs to invest in very low carbon energy supply if it is to both abide by its international obligations and support economically sustainable technologies.        5.00pm GMT       Damian Carrington, the Guardian&apos;s head of environment, has just posted a blog headlined: &quot;This fracking fantasy is the delusion of fossil fuel addiction&quot;:  This is nothing more than the delusion of addiction. Like all addictions, our fossil fuel craving tempts us to ignore inconvenient truths that threaten our next fix. The simple reality for shale gas in Europe is that no serious, independent authority, from the International Energy Agency down, thinks fracking will provide enough gas to dent its price in Europe. As the government&apos;s own advisers set out today, over-reliance on gas exposes consumers to far higher hikesin bills. Those memorably dubbed frack-heads by Andrew Rawnsley tend to ignore climate change but the prime minister did not. Instead, he prescribed the equivalent of a drug user dealing with a wild high by swallowing a fistful of downers. If the gas revolution did come to pass, Cameron said, then capturing and burying the emissions would deal with climate change. Yet fitting that expensive technology in order to burn &quot;cheap&quot; gas is like happily getting addicted to heroin because you can check into rehab later.        4.54pm GMT       Lawrence Carter, a Greenpeace climate campaigner, has written a piece for the New Statesman chiding the government - particularly George Osborne - for basing its pro-fracking energy policy on &quot;ideology rather than evidence&quot;:  So how likely is it that well enjoy a US style fracking revolution here? Not very, say experts. Analysts at Deutsche Bank, the International Energy Agency (IEA), Ofgem, the European Commission, Chatham House and others, have all concluded that the fall in gas prices seen in the U.S. will not be replicated in Europe. Deutsche Bank, for example, concluded that those waiting for a shale gas revolution outside the US will likely be disappointed, in terms of both price and the speed at which high-volume production can be achieved. While the IEA have outlined how European shale gas will be 50 per cent more expensive to extract. Yet Osborne is betting the farm, and the UKs energy future, on fracking bringing costs down enough to make it economic to run almost half our power supply off gas... Precisely why Osborne has chosen to ignore the facts in order to pursue his dash for gas is for others to speculate. But for consumers up and down the UK, not to mention our attempts to tackle the urgent threat of climate change, it would be infinitely more reassuring if our energy policy was based on evidence rather than ideology.        4.41pm GMT    Cuadrilla's reaction    Cuadrilla, the private company given permission today to resume its fracking exploration in Lancashire, has, unsurprisingly, welcomed the news:  Todays news is a turning point for the countrys energy future. Shale gas has the potential to create jobs, generate tax revenues, reduce our reliance on imported gas, and improve our balance of payments, said Francis Egan, CEO of Cuadrilla Resources. Our exploration has shown that under Lancashire there is a belt of gas-filled shale over one mile thick. Todays decision will allow continued exploration and testing of the UKs very significant shale resources in a way that fulfils the highest environmental and community standards. Cuadrilla is pleased that Decc has recognized the major improvements it has made. The company is ready to move ahead with its plans, involving the hydraulic fracturing and flow testing of a number of wells in Lancashire in 2013. Before these further exploration and testing plans can proceed, Cuadrilla will work closely with Decc and its representatives, Lancashire County Council, the Environment Agency, the HSE, the local communities and other relevant parties to obtain regulatory approvals and planning permission. In cooperation with Decc, Cuadrilla has already taken a number of steps to further reduce environmental risk. Key among these is an advanced system for seismic monitoring that allows Cuadrilla and DECC to closely monitor and regulate hydraulic fracturing activity.  The Wall Street Journal also has an interview with Cuadrilla&apos;s Francis Egan:  Mr. Egan said that Cuadrilla, which obtained a license to explore in Lancashire in 2008, but had to halt fracking last year following minor earthquakes in the area, is spending &quot;several million pounds&quot; on advanced systems for seismic monitoring. It must also get approval from local authorities, a process that is likely to take several months, Mr. Egan said. Cuadrilla is expected to start fracking in the first half of next year in two or three wells, he said.        4.18pm GMT    Price of natural gas    There&apos;s lots of talk about how the shale gas &quot;revolution&quot; has caused natural gas prices in the US to plummet in recent years - and how it might/might not do the same in the UK. The US Department of Energy website has a useful section which lets you see industrial prices, wellhead prices and, crucially, residential prices across various time periods.       4.08pm GMT    Protest    Here&apos;s another indication that protestors will try to block any company seeking permission to frack for shale gas in the UK. A statement just released by Lilly Morse, a Frack Off campaigner:  The long expected announcement that the government will allow fracking companies to continue attempts at exploitation of unconventional gas is the start of a major battle over what sort of world we will leave to our children. The government and industrys promises of cheap, abundant gas are deluded. In the US the gas bubble has already burst with fracking companies on the verge of bankruptcy. Drilling has ground to a halt and gas prices have doubled since the beginning of the year. The governments strategy of relying on fracking to fuel a new wave of gas fired power stations is utterly insane. Fracking is dirty, destructive and extremely expensive, and could never deliver the quantities of gas envisaged. In the last year and a half, a growing number of communities have begun organising to oppose fracking. Those communities can now clearly see that if they do not win this fight they will be sacrificed for the profits of vested interests. The evidence from the US and Australia that fracking destroys water supplies, air quality, ecosystems, and peoples health has been mounting for years, and is now too strong to ignore. Waiting for even more impacts to be discovered is not an option.        4.02pm GMT       Dissent in the shires (namely, key constituencies for the Conservative party) is already surfacing at the news of fracking being allowed to resume. Here&apos;s some reaction in Sussex:  Vanessa Vine, a Balcombe resident, of Frack Free Sussex (FFS), fears for the ecological future around the site as it is near the London to Brighton railway line, the River Ouse, Ardingly Reservoir, and a Grade II listed viaduct. The threat is not only to our seismic security, but puts in jeopardy our wild ecology, our farmland and thereby our health, through industrialisation of our landscape and resultant contamination of soil, air and groundwater, she said. It beggars belief that our legislators appear set to allow hydraulic fracturing to be carried out.  Meanwhile, Paul Miner, senior planning officer at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said:  Before commercial scale extraction happens, there must be a full and transparent planning process. The government doesnt appear to have recognised the potential for major landscape damage, or the need to properly consider this at the local level. If fracking is to happen, it must be with the support of local communities, who are most at risk if things go wrong, and without damaging the countryside.     Updated at 4.26pm GMT     3.43pm GMT       The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), which &quot;carries out world-class research into sustainable future energy systems&quot;, has put out a press release containing reaction to Davey&apos;s announcement. It says the announcement &quot;should not be interpreted as a green light for wide spread commercial development of shale gas in the UK&quot;:  UKERC gas expert Professor Michael Bradshaw says: &quot;Only an exploratory drilling programme can provide the information needed to arrive at a better assessment of the reserve base, but the US experience suggests that even that will provide limited understanding. It is only by extensive drilling that commercial levels of production can be guaranteed. Any further decisions must assess the commercial viability of shale gas in the UK, against the regulatory costs and tax regime, the environmental impacts (both direct in relation to the drilling activity and indirect in terms of greenhouse gas emissions) and the wider societal acceptance of the industry. In short, shale gas will remain a conditional resource in the UK for some-time to come.&quot; Christophe McGlade helped conduct a UKERC review into shale gas resources, he reinforces this view saying: &quot;Estimates of technically recoverable resources are significantly more useful than the much more speculative and rather less helpful estimates of gas in place. Drilling will also aid estimation of the potential for economic recovery of these resources. Exploratory drilling will hence reduce the uncertainties that currently exist over the size of the UK resource base and allow a more evidence based discussion on the potential role of shale gas in the UK energy system.&quot;        3.30pm GMT       Professor Robert Mair, chair of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering review of shale gas published earlier this year, has commented on today&apos;s announcement:  We are pleased to see the government recognise the importance of the joint Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering report on the geological and environmental risks of shale gas extraction in the UK. We welcomed the opportunity to discuss our recommendations with the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the Health and Safety Executive and Environment Agency recently and commend their commitment to implementing the recommendations set out in our report. Our report concluded that the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation. It is now up to the government, regulatory bodies and operators to ensure that these responsibilities are met. Safeguarding well integrity is at the heart of ensuring that risks associated with hydraulic fracturing can be managed effectively. Our report highlighted the need for continued monitoring by independent experts to ensure that each well is designed, constructed and operated in a safe and responsible manner. We strongly encourage both the government and the operators to implement a properly independent examination and onsite inspection programme so that the public can have confidence in the process. The decision by Ed Davey to commission a study of the possible impacts of shale gas extraction on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change should be welcomed. There are few reliable estimates of the carbon footprint of shale gas extraction and potential methane leakages during the extraction process have been highlighted as a concern, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas. The findings of this study will be important in deciding the future of large scale extraction of shale gas in the UK.  At the time the review was published, I wrote an article asking why it had failed to investigate the potential climate impact of exploiting shale gas reserves. I still find the omission rather mystifying, given its obvious significance.    Updated at 3.33pm GMT     3.09pm GMT    Extent of shale gas in UK    If you want a better sense of where other than Lancashire shale gas could be fracked in the UK, it&apos;s worth taking a look at these maps and charts produced by the Department of Energy and Climate Change last year. (The British Geological Survey has a handy page on all this, too.) When I spoke to the BGS earlier this week, it said that it is currently only producing an estimate of the gas potentially recoverable in the Bowland Shales. This geological formation spreads from underneath Lancashire out to the eastern Irish sea and across to the western section of the North Sea. The BGS believes that it is &quot;thickest&quot; under the Irish Sea, but, to date, fracking is only being considered onshore. The BGS also admitted to me that its previous reserve estimates (as much as 150bn cubic metres) had been &quot;back of the fag packet&quot; in comparison to the report it is preparing for Decc at the moment. It is worth noting, though, its conclusion when it produced its 2010 estimate (pdf):  Even if one assumes that the American shale gas producing analogies are valid, many of the operating conditions are different in the UK. In the UK, land owners do not own mineral rights, so there is less incentive to support development, and local authorities must grant planning consent. The US has relatively permissive environmental regulations, low population densities, tax incentives, existing infrastructure, well developed supply chains and access to technology. Cumulatively, these factors mean that it is far from certain that the conditions that underpin shale gas production in North America will be replicable in the UK.  The BGS also told me that it is possibly better to look at how shale gas is being exploited in Poland, rather than the US: &quot;It&apos;s a window into where the UK might be in 5-6 years.&quot; Here&apos;s a video of Ed Hough, a BGS geologist, talking about shale gas in the UK...            And if you really want to, er, drill down into this subject, here&apos;s a 40-minute presentation about shale gas in the UK given in June by Prof Mike Stephenson, the BGS&apos;s head of energy...                 1.56pm GMT       The International Energy Agency is not due to launch its &quot;Medium-Term Coal Market Report-2012&quot; until next Tuesday. (Yes, don&apos;t tell me: you all had it in your diaries already). However, a press release giving a taster of the report has already surfaced online:  The international coal market is experiencing dynamic changes. In 2011, China alone accounted for more than three-quarters of incremental coal production, while domestic consumption was more than three times that of global trade. Low gas prices associated with the shale gas revolution caused a marked decrease in coal use in the United States, the worlds second-largest consumer. This led US thermal coal producers to seek other markets, which resulted in an oversupply of coal in Europe and a significant gas-to-coal switch.  Is the IEA report really going to argue that the US shale gas &quot;revolution&quot; (a term David Cameron was keen to adopt this week when discussing the UK&apos;s shale gas prospects) has, somewhat perversely, led to an increase in coal use in Europe?! If so, that would be an unfortunate - and unforeseen - side effect.       1.37pm GMT       Michael Liebreich, CEO of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, published some interesting analysis on shale gas at the end of October and, in particular, its likely impact on UK energy prices:  There is no reason to believe that it will push gas prices down in the UK in the same way as they have recently in the U.S. Shale gas has been an astonishing success story there, within a few years shifting the country from being a long-term gas importer to a potential exporter, and pushing prices down from $6-11 per mmBtu to as low as $1.73 in April. There are caveats. The U.S. gas price has rebounded by over 90 percent from its lows, and is now around $3.50 per mmBtu. Some wells can make money at very low prices, though most cannot. As Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil Corp.s chief executive, recently said of the U.S. shale gas miracle: We are all losing our shirts today. You know, were making no money. Its all in the red. The fact is that shale gas operators in the US need a gas price of around $5 per mmBtu in order to justify continuing to drill, frack and build pipelines. All analysts expect the U.S. natural gas price to rise to $5 or $6 per mmBtu. Bloomberg New Energy Finances own predictions are for a price of $5.50 by end-2015. And that is in the US, where conditions are ideal for shale gas: great geology, low population density, an existing pipeline network, a fragmented regulatory environment, landowners with sub-surface mineral rights and a liquid market for rigs and drilling services. Given conditions in the U.K., it is hard to see shale gas coming to market at much below $8 per mmBtu  around the same as the wholesale prices that have been driving up utility bills in recent years.  He continues:  In order to replace the decline of UK Continental Shelf gas production through 2030  before starting to replace any coal or nuclear power  you would need 2,400 fracked wells. Assume 10 wells per pad, and that is 240 pads. Each one is an industrial development in the countryside, and this number would extend over an area the size of Lancashire. In terms of production per well, at its peak, one fracked well can produce enough gas to match the output of 50 onshore or 15 offshore wind turbines. However, the decline curve of a fracked well is so steep that within two years, each well could replace as few as four onshore or one offshore turbine (and yes, these figures are adjusted for the efficiency of gas generation and the intermittency of wind).        1.10pm GMT    Video    Here&apos;s Ed Davey making his Commons statement earlier on the resumption of fracking...            And here&apos;s the BBC News channel discussing the news with Mark Wallace of the Institute of Directors, who says the &quot;government has made the right decision&quot;...              Updated at 1.44pm GMT     12.56pm GMT       Over on the Guardian&apos;s Comment is Free, a Debate of the Day has just launched. Much like this Eco Audit, it is asking: &quot;Fracking for shale gas: the right way forward?&quot;. It features Mark Lynas, the environmental author, and David Santillo, senior scientist for Greenpeace. Here&apos;s a taster...  Lynas: Gas is a cleaner fuel than coal, but because coal is currently cheaper than gas the UK&apos;s carbon emissions are higher than they need to be. Shale gas could reverse this situation as it has in the US, where coal is in decline and emissions are falling. In the longer term, however, gas-fired power stations should be required to capture their emissions through carbon capture and storage technologies. Santillo: It appears that the greenhouse gas &quot;footprint&quot; of shale gas may be significantly greater than for conventional gas and has even be claimed by some to be worse than coal. Greenpeace is therefore opposed to the exploitation of unconventional gas reserves until the impacts are fully investigated, understood, addressed and regulated. We call for significant more effort to be put into understanding the full impacts of fracking.        12.51pm GMT    Activism    It is becoming clear that any company seeking to frack for shale gas in the UK will be met with resistance from local campaigners and environmental groups. This seems to be reflected in a recent report (pdf) on &quot;anti-fracking activisim&quot; published by Control Risks, an &quot;independent, global risk consultancy specialising in helping organisations manage political, integrity and security risks in complex and hostile environments&quot;. On pg 15 of the report it describes the risk in the UK as &quot;significant&quot;. It describes &quot;significant&quot; as meaning:  Activist groups are well-organised and actively network internationally. Campaigns are directed specifically against unconventional gas development. Social activism poses considerable political risks and moderate operational and security risks to unconventional gas development.  Meanwhile, I&apos;ve just been sent this note by the Fuel Poverty Action:  Shame on Ed Davey for caving in to the Big Six energy companies and George Osborne. People across the UK will suffer at the hands of Davey&apos;s spinelessness. Fracking means higher fuel bills, earthquakes and cancer, as well as spelling disaster for the climate. In contrast, renewables are clean, safe and would save the average household 500 off their fuel bills over the coming decades. There is overwhelming public support for renewables over gas - our democracy is being trampled over while we&apos;re ripped off and left to freeze. We&apos;re furious and we&apos;re going to fight back.        12.34pm GMT    Twitter reaction      Forget local #fracking issues; big one is climate.

What a pity renewables cant get that financial muscle.&mdash; Terry Macalister (@TerryMac999) December 13, 2012        12.17pm GMT       If you missed the fracking debate on BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme this morning, you can listen here. It included David Kennedy, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, and John Hofmeister, a former Shell executive in the US and founder of Citizens for Affordable Energy. And with handy timing, the Committee on Climate Change has published a report today examining the impacts of meeting carbon budgets on energy prices and bills. It doesn&apos;t seem to be sold on the idea that fracking automatically leads to cheaper energy bills (nor that it would help the UK meet its carbon targets):  The value of a low-carbon portfolio will depend on future gas prices, which are not expected to fall in the UK, and carbon prices, which are expected to rise: The International Energy Agencys projections for European gas prices in the 2020s suggest that these would be in line with DECCs central scenario (i.e. slightly higher than currently and broadly flat from 2020, at around 70 p/therm) under a world with significant utilisation of unconventional (e.g. shale) gas resources (Figure 5.1). If the extraction of unconventional gas is more limited, then costs would rise to 2030 (i.e. to reach around 85 p/therm in 2030). The Governments carbon price underpin implies an acceleration in carbon prices in the 2020s (i.e. this is set to rise from 32/tCO2 in 2020 to 76/tCO2 in 2030. Beyond this, the Governments carbon values assume rising carbon costs to around 200/tCO2 in 2050, whilst global carbon price modelling suggests significantly higher prices are also possible (e.g. modelling for the Committee by UCL suggests that carbon prices in 2050 could reach around 500/tCO2 even with an active global carbon market taking advantage of trading opportunities to minimise global abatement costs, see Figure 5.2).  (Go to pg 55 of the PDF of the report for the figures referenced above.)       11.54am GMT          Boris Johnson speaks to the media in a woolly hat. Photograph: Peter MACDIARMID/REUTERS    Earlier this week, Boris Johnson, London&apos;s mayor, came out firmly in favour of fracking with characteristic aplomb and verve in his Telegraph column:  In their mad denunciations of fracking, the Greens and the eco-warriors betray the mindset of people who cannot bear a piece of unadulterated good news. Beware this new technology, they wail. Do not tamper with the corsets of Gaia! Dont probe her loamy undergarments with so much as a finger  or else the goddess of the earth will erupt with seismic revenge. Dig out this shale gas, they warn, and our water will be poisoned and our children will be stunted and our cattle will be victims of terrible intestinal explosions.  Damian Kahya at Greenpeace&apos;s Energy Desk has now produced a rather handy fact-checker analysing Johnson&apos;s 10 key claims.    Updated at 12.02pm GMT     11.36am GMT       Many thanks to all those who&apos;ve already posted comments below. Plenty of interest and debate already...  DoctorChris: The critical issue will be how much fugitive methane escapes when the gas is produced, and how much CO2 will be released when the gas is burned. Shale gas from fracking should have to pay for any climate change impacts that these cause, at about 60 per tonne for the CO2, and perhaps 20 times that for any methane released. londonlandlord: If the country starts capturing the global warming gas carbon dioxide from coal power plants and injecting it underground, there is a potential for a larger quakes given the amount of the heat-trapping gas that would have to be buried That&apos;s an issue that needs more study. When are we going to hear &quot;concerns&quot; about the above? EnviroCapitalist: It seems to have taken an awful long time to reach this decision. Britain is going to be reliant on gas for a long time to come. This is even more the case if there is a substantial investment in renewables, which will need substantial backup capacity. Even the technical people at FoE and Greenpeace accept this - though their political people don&apos;t mention this. The only way to escape gas would be to go all out for nuclear power, which isn&apos;t going to happen. At the same time, Britian is currently producing 40% of its electricity from coal. Replacing this with gas is an instant environmental win. Replacing this with local gas is an instant economic win. We also use a lot of gas for heating - heating with anything else is a long way off. Better that our gas is locally produced gas rather than Russian gas or Qatari gas. Yes, standards of production need to be high and verified. Caudrilla say all the right things on their website, but this will need to be verified. The gas won&apos;t be very cheap, but that is because of the work needed to extract it - which means jobs.        11.22am GMT       I&apos;ve spotted some details within the various statements and documents released by Decc that are likely to further fuel the debate over fracking in the UK. For example, here are a few snippets from Davey&apos;s statement that caught my eye:  So far as Cuadrillas current exploration programme in Lancashire is concerned, the remedial action level for the traffic light system (that is, the red light) will be set at magnitude 0.5 (far below a perceptible surface event, but larger than the expected level generated by the fracturing of the rock). I consider that this is an appropriately precautionary approach. We received representations in our consultation that this is too cautious.  Given that Cuadrilla caused a 2.3 magnitude tremor during its previous wave of test drilling (and it lobbied for a 1.7 limit), how will this new 0.5 &quot;red light&quot; affect its forthcoming exploration?  Other concerns which have been expressed are not to do with the current phase of exploration work but with the implications of a possible future move to production operations, if the exploration is successful. It is by no means certain that any such operations will ever be proposed, but if they were, a different set of considerations would arise...  This is a big reminder by Davey that he has only granted the resumption of exploration, not production. A big difference. In other words, there are still many hurdles to clear before the UK sees fracking on the scale currently seen in the US.  So far as the use of chemicals is concerned, the environment agencies take a risk-based approach to the regulation of the use of chemicals in shale gas fracking activities. The hazard potential of all substances proposed to be injected into the ground will be assessed and the use of substances hazardous to groundwater will not be permitted. The identity of all substances proposed for injection, and the agencys conclusions on their hazard potential, will be publicly available.  In the US, the secrecy by some companies about the chemicals they use during fracking has caused considerable disquiet and distrust. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the UK government will insist such information is made public.  Concern has also been expressed about the quantities of water used in fracking, or the disposal of waste water from the process. The water used may of course be obtained from licensed suppliers, but if directly abstracted by the operators, requires a licence from the environment agency. Licences will only be given where the agency is satisfied that a sustainable supply is obtainable. Equally, disposal of waste water is subject to scrutiny by the agencies and will require a permit. The waste water from the operations in Lancashire has been found to contain low levels of radioactivity. A case-specific radiological assessment is required in support of any application for a permit for the disposal of radioactive waste. The agency will critically review any such assessment, and will only issue a permit if satisfied.  Expect the issue of water contamination to be a key battleground for environmentalists and local communities keen to stop fracking.  DECC has come to the conclusion that Cuadrillas response to the occurrence of the tremors demonstrated some weaknesses in its management of environmental risks. This conclusion has been discussed with the company, and they have in consequence reinforced their overall management structure, including by assigning to one board member specific responsibility for health and safety measures, and by reinforcing technical skills within the operational team. The effectiveness of these changes, and the resulting revised structure, is at present being reviewed for Cuadrilla by external consultants.  Davey is clearly indicating that Cuadrilla has been placed on the naughty step and will be watched very closely indeed by regulators. One further slip up by Cuadrilla could be disastrous for the prospects of fracking in the UK.  I intend to commission a study into the possible impacts of shale gas extraction on greenhouse gas emissions. This will consider the available evidence on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from shale gas exploitation, and the need for further research. I have invited Professor David Mackay, my Departments Chief Scientific Adviser and Dr Tim Stone, the Expert Chair of the Office of Nuclear Development to undertake this work.  Arguably, this is the key environmental question hanging over fracking. This study should have, perhaps, been commissioned before the green-light was given by Davey, but, nonetheless, plenty of attention and scrutiny will be give to the Mackay and Stone report when it is published.  We are also taking steps to prepare the way for any future production phase, though this is likely to be some years away. We have commissioned more detailed work on the shale gas resources of Great Britain from the British Geological Survey (BGS) and this will be published early next year. I emphasise that this will provide only an estimate of the resource, the gas in the ground, and not the reserves, the amount of gas which can in practice be produced economically from that resource. Until more exploration work has been done, a significant number of wells fracked and production patterns established over time, it will not be possible to make any meaningful estimate of likely economically recoverable resources of shale gas in the United Kingdom.  Again, another key part of Davey&apos;s statement. There is currently lots of noise being generated, particularly by shale gas enthusiasts, about the &quot;game-changing&quot; amounts of it under the ground waiting to be exploited. But it is little more than optimistic guesswork, at present. Until Decc publishes the BGS report in, as I&apos;ve been told, January, treat any firm statements about the quantity and quality of &quot;gas in place&quot; and &quot;recoverable reserves&quot; (there&apos;s a huge difference between the two) with extreme caution. And even then, the BGS is telling me that its report will still be an estimate based, in part, on Cuadrilla&apos;s &quot;gas content&quot; figures from its 2-3 test rigs. The BGS admits it needs data from dozens, if not hundreds, of wells to make a more accurate estimate. Finally, I haven&apos;t had a chance to fully go through this Q&amp;A on fracking (pdf) posted by Decc, but I did spot this on pg 31:  Why would the UK exploit shale gas when it is clearly not aligned to managing global warming?Shale gas production would in the first place replace declining offshore gas production and reduce reliance on external supplies. Beyond that point, use of gas could displace use of coal in generation, with a positive effect on GHG reduction (provided fugitive emissions are subject to proper controls as outlined above). Investment in shale gas must be at the expense of investment in renewables?It is too early to say whether shale gas will be able to contribute significantly to our sources of gas supplies for the future. But the recently published gas generation strategy confirms that the government sees a significant role for gas into the future; while continuing development of renewable supply will be essential to meeting our targets for renewables and wider climate change goals.  I don&apos;t know about you, but I find these answers far too vague to be reassuring.    Updated at 11.28am GMT     10.37am GMT       Reaction to Davey&apos;s announcement is arriving at a furious pace. I will try to include as much as I can as the day continues, but here&apos;s a taster:  Dr Nick Riley, head of science policy (Europe) at the British Geological Survey:   Drilling and testing for shale gas will allow Britain to assess whether we have an economic resource and how it can be accessed with minimum impact to the environment. Gas is the greenest of the fossil fuels and may have a role in reducing carbon emissions in countries which are dependent on coal for electricity generation, but shale gas also has high emissions from all the energy used in drilling and fracking. If gas power generation is connected with carbon capture and storage the convenience of home grown gas can be combined with very low emissions to help keep Britain within its emissions targets.   Prof Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh:   The UK undoubtedly has some shale gas resource and, if the relevant environmental regulations and monitoring are enforced, this can be a lower carbon source of fossil energy than imported gas. Fracking is well established in the subsurface industry, and monitoring should greatly reduce the risk of earth tremor. High quality well casing and sealing of drilling fluids and gas production from surrounding aquifers is equally important, as is control of fugitive emissions. However, I expect the rollout of shale gas in the UK to be a lot slower than the Treasury hope for, and not to control the price of domestic gas supplies.   Mnica Cristina, spokeswoman of Shale Gas Europe:   We welcome unreservedly this momentous decision which has potential to create jobs and enhance energy security in Europe. While there continues to be intense speculation around risks, there is now substantial scientific evidence to support the UK governments decision. In June 2012 the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering concluded that the health, safety and environmental risks associated with the technique can be effectively managed. There are significant potential opportunities, as the British Geological Survey estimates UK shale gas resources maybe 50 per cent larger than conventional gas resources. Todays announcement follows the European Parliaments rejection of a Europe-wide moratorium on shale gas development on 21 November 2012. It highlights that the UK is ready to move forward with the sustainable development of its domestic natural gas resources following a thorough review of its impact. The UK now has the opportunity to further secure its gas supply, boost jobs and economic activity while reducing CO2 emissions when replacing higher carbon content fuels.   Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth:   Giving the green light to fracking for shale gas will send shock waves across the UK. Communities up and down the country will be disturbed by this reckless decision which threatens to contaminate our air and water and undermine national climate targets. George Osbornes short-sighted dash for gas will leave the country dependent on dirty fossil fuels  MPs must stand up for a safe and affordable future by insisting on clean British energy from the wind, waves and sun.   Ben Caldecott, head of policy, Climate Change Capital:   Fracking will continue to generate significant local opposition, which will undermine long term political support and the investment case for a UK shale gas expansion. This is fortunate, as it&apos;s clear from the latest Committee on Climate Change findings that another dash for gas will expose us to higher and more volatile fuel prices.     Updated at 10.43am GMT     10.24am GMT       Before we start in earnest, here are the essential links that have been uploaded onto Decc&apos;s website this morning following Davey&apos;s announcement... Written Ministerial Statement by Edward Davey: Exploration for Shale Gas Update 13 Dec 2012 - New controls on seismic risks permit a resumption of shale gas exploration Government response to Royal Academy of Engineers and Royal Society report on Shale Gas Extraction in the UK: a review of hydraulic fracturing Synopsis of main questions raised in responses to DECC consultation on mitigation of seismic risks from hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, with government responses    Updated at 10.31am GMT     9.17am GMT    Welcome to the Eco Audit    Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has set out this morning why he is allowing the resumption of fracking for shale gas in UK. He said that fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - can only resume with new safeguards to address the risk of seismic activity:  Having carefully reviewed the evidence with the aid of independent experts, and with the aid of an authoritative review of the scientific and engineering evidence on shale gas extraction conducted by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society, I have concluded that appropriate controls are available to mitigate the risks of undesirable seismic activity. Those new controls will be required by my Department for all future shale gas wells. On that basis, I am in principle prepared to consent to new fracking proposals for shale gas, where all other necessary permissions and consents are in place. This opens the way to a resumption of work on exploration for shale gas, though I stress the importance of the other regulatory consents, and planning permission, which are also necessary for these activities, and which must be in place before my Department will consider consent to individual operations. In practice, it will be well into next year before any new exploration work has all the necessary consents to proceed. Whether any production operations may be proposed will depend on the success of the exploration work, but, in any event, this is likely to be some years away yet.  The widely expected move comes amid a fierce debate in the UK about the merits and dangers of fracking. Some say it is safe and will lead to cheaper energy. Others say it presents too many environmental hazards and is unlikely to force down gas prices, as it has done in the US. Is the UK government right to give the green-light - with conditions - to fracking exploration in Lancashire and, potentially, beyond? Please leave your thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict.    Updated at 10.11am GMT  ",

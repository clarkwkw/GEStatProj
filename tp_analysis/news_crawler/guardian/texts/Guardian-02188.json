    "text": "Today the British Council publishes the findings of a study that ought to raise the spirits of university and college international officers and senior managers across the country. Analysis of economic, demographic, and educational trends in more than 50 countries suggests that UK higher education stands to reap the rewards of a coming &quot;decade of opportunity&quot; in global markets. But a report on the research, due to be published next month, will temper this encouraging message with an important caveat. While the UK can expect to increase its intake of international students by more than any other country outside of Australia, this potential may well not be realised if the government sticks to its policy of putting obstacles in the way of prospective overseas students with tougher visa regulations. Until recently concern over the impact of visa changes on international recruitment has been treated like the elephant in the room by the British Council. But last month, it called for a review of the changes as it published a report on how stricter visa rules in Australia and the United States have brought significant drops in international student intakes. Both countries have since relaxed these rules. The study published today forecasts that, now unheeded by misguided visa barriers, Australia will lead the way on growth in international student recruitment during the coming 10 years, taking in more than 50,000 more overseas students in this period. With around 30,000 new intakes, the UK will be marginally ahead of the US and Canada  but it could well fall behind unless we follow Australia and the US and loosen visa restrictions. Some may say that there is no need to worry. The latest UCAS figures indicate that the UK continues to attract growing numbers of international students, despite all the bad publicity over visas. However, the changes do not actually come into force until April, so the true impact has yet to be felt. The British Council analysis suggests that much of the potential international growth for the UK will come from India, which is forecast to become the fastest growing source of international students by 2020. But this is a market highly sensitive to visa changes, and a country whose media is quick to pick up on stories about them. Another earlier British Council report suggested that a growing number of Indian students are opting to study in the US, and this is echoed by the current study. Some argue that UK universities should focus more on looking after home students as higher tuition fees kick in from September. The fact is, however, that income from international students is effectively subsidising courses and facilities for those from the UK. If this income drops, will home fee levels have to rise to compensate? In economically challenging times, there is also no getting away from the fact that education is currently the fifth largest service export sector for the UK economy. This is a vital market not just for universities and colleges, but also for many specialist service providers like my own organisation that are supporting institutions in their efforts to meet the needs of international students. We must remember too that international students are worth much more than the fees they pay. Their presence helps create an internationalised environment and context for learning and research  something highly valued by employers looking for globally aware graduates to fill posts in companies trading internationally. When they graduate themselves, many return home to move into influential positions in government, education, business and industry  and if we treat them well they will be inclined towards collaborating or trading with our country in future years. Of course university and college managers are completely aware of this, and to some extent so are ministers. But as the British Council plays host to over a thousand international higher education leaders at its Going Global conference today, it is a message worth repeating and one that needs to be heard and acted upon by the bureaucrats guarding our borders. If the UK can learn the lessons of some of its greatest international competitors, our higher education sector will be much better placed to seize the opportunities of the coming decade.

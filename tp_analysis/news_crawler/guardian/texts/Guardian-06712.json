    "text": "Just before Christmas last year, I joined a small group of other parents for our weekly meeting of the &quot;local schools for local children&quot; group we&apos;d started a few months earlier. It had started off as a parent campaign to improve the provision of secondary education and offer more choice in and around the East Finchley area of London, where we live. Discussions with the local authority had shown them to be sympathetic, but their hands were tied when it came to creating the type of provision we sought  these days it has to be a free school, or nothing. The evening was to mark a turning point as we debated whether we wanted to try and set up our own school. As we went round the table, one by one everyone slowly and somewhat reluctantly raised their hands in support of developing a proposal to establish a new free school, and the Archer academy was born. I am not what you would call a typical free-school supporter, having been quite a vocal critic of free schools during my time as chief executive of a national charity. My main criticism was that the policy allowed more affluent communities to benefit from additional resources, but left poorer areas that lacked the resources and ambition at a disadvantage. Whatever the original intention, free schools could too easily contribute to greater inequality as the gap between rich and poor widens and the least well-off fall even further behind. In some respects, I have not changed my view about this. The government&apos;s support for free schools, in common with much of the coalition&apos;s agenda, shows little concern for how equitable the take-up and benefit of these are among different communities. However, my experience leads me to believe that free schools could contribute to tackling deep-rooted problems in poorer areas and be a positive force for change. If, and it&apos;s a big if, we target support towards more deprived communities to enable parents to ensure local provision meets local needs and aspirations. East Finchley is not a poor area, but it is quite a mixed community, with families living in social housing sitting alongside some very expensive houses. Our primary schools are good and they attract a very socio-economically diverse intake of pupils, but there is a shocking lack of mixed-sex, non-denominational, non-selective secondary provision. In practice, this means that more affluent parents simply move house to be in the (ever shrinking) catchment areas of half-decent schools, or they send their children to fee-paying schools. Those who cannot afford those options are left with a Hobson&apos;s choice, having to select the &quot;least worst&quot; option rather than positively choosing the best school for their child. While I acknowledge that the education of my own children was a strong motivation in proposing the Archer academy, addressing the inequity of the current situation was also a major incentive. As you might expect from a group such as ours, community sits firmly at the centre of our educational vision. The Archer academy aims to reflect the needs and ambitions of our whole community and be a focal point for community life, actively contributing to making the area vibrant and resilient. We have spent a great deal of time engaging local people  parents, teachers, school governors, politicians, community groups and local businesses  to make sure the school is owned by our community. The results speak for themselves, with over 1,000 local parents  spanning pre-school to year 5  expressing their support, amounting to 50% more demand than there will be places for in each of the next seven years. We are passionate about ensuring the school serves the whole community and this will be reflected in our admissions policy. We will be working closely with local primaries, which have a very diverse intake of pupils, to ensure we provide an outstanding school for all children. For the Archer academy to be successful, we know it has to prepare our young people for an ever-changing and uncertain future. So an emphasis on transferable skills and employability is central to our approach. We have also sought to embed creative and critical thinking into our plans  influenced by, for example, the evidence quoted by Sir Ken Robinson highlighting how divergent thinking reduces among children the longer they spend in the education system. We want our children&apos;s education to equip them for their working lives, where challenges don&apos;t come in easy-to-manage silos. We want our children to develop problem-solving skills that cut across the curriculum and encourage them to think for themselves. But we also need to ensure that attainment is uncompromised, as this is what parents want for their children. It&apos;s no good producing well-rounded, creative-thinking school-leavers with no qualifications. As a school serving the whole community, we need to ensure our educational offer reflects differing abilities and aptitudes through individual learning plans. We will not accept the low ambitions or expectations that exist among some parts of society. We want to open the minds of our children to possibilities and inspire them to believe they can achieve amazing things, whatever profession they choose. We have lined up a range of successful local residents from a wide range of professions to come in and talk to our children about their experience. We&apos;ll have lawyers, journalists, statisticians, charity leaders, artists and small business owners. We have decided to specialise in English and maths, as the foundations of so many jobs or careers. However, although developing the vision for our school has been energising, my experience of preparing the proposal has been utterly horrendous. Around a dozen of us, with very little experience of working in education, spent a ridiculous amount of time preparing the bid. Completing the application while balancing work and family life was a tremendous challenge and took up nearly every evening and weekend. Perhaps this is why there have been so few parent-proposed free schools. We managed to get through the selection process by exploiting our social capital  roping in family and friends  and by dividing up work of at least 100 hours a week between us. Membership of our group grew as we drafted in education experts, accountants and premises specialists  these skills complementing our existing experience of setting up and running projects, marketing, community engagement, strategic planning, research and other skills. The process has been like running a marathon, but with hurdles. And I realise that receiving approval from the Department for Education is just one milestone along the way; there is still a huge amount of work to be done. I believe there is much to be learned from our experience, for policymakers, educationists and other parent groups. I know of plenty of parents in other areas who are unhappy with the poor choice they face for their children&apos;s education. Can the Archer academy serve to inspire other groups? If so, then the DfE needs to look closely at the process and find ways of ensuring that parents with ambition are not put off by the sheer scale of what is asked of them. There is a real danger that free schools become the sole preserve of those with the resources and capacity to take on such a huge undertaking, such as faith groups or independent schools. By providing support and encouragement to parents, we could establish a new generation of outstanding schools. However, to achieve this will require targeted support to those least likely to take advantage of the opportunities free schools present. If we blithely assume that simply creating an opportunity will result in better outcomes for all, we will simply be accepting increased inequality. But if we focus effort on supporting the most deprived communities to believe they can have better, then maybe there&apos;s a chance that free schools can be a driver of positive social change. www.thearcheracademy.org.uk",

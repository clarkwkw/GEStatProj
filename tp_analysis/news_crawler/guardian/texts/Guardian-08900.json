    "text": "The release of the iPhone 5 and the new iPod Touch bring with them the launch of Apple&apos;s new operating system iOS6 and a host of new app possibilities. The map app has been given a noticeable revamp, with Google dumped in favour of Apple designed navigation. Working with TomTom, it has a clean look, with spoken turn-by-turn navigation and traffic updates. The beautiful 3D flyover views being shown off in the ads aren&apos;t available in the UK yet, but the integration with all of the iPhone&apos;s features is now prioritised. For example, Siri, the voice-control app, which has been vastly improved, now offers a local search where you can simply ask it torecommend a bar or restaurant. The camera app has also been improved. It is quicker to take pictures and has a panorama mode, to capture up to 240 degrees of landscape. The device then stitches together multiple images to create one impressive panoramic shot. The iPhone 5 will also be the first to offer 4G, making high-speed mobile downloads available for the first time. EE, Orange and T-Mobile&apos;s parent company, will be the only network offering the service later in the year. For those keen on multiplayer gaming or watching streaming video it will be a compelling reason to switch and, combined with the improved processing power, will offer game developers plenty of exciting opportunities in the future.",

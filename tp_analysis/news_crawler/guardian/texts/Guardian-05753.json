Nikon D7000, 1/640 sec, f/7.1, 500 mm, iso320    Question: This Australian mystery bird has an interesting behaviour, especially for a bird that breeds near the equator. What behaviour is that? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: These are fairy martins, Petrochelidon ariel, small passerines that are placed into the swallow and martin family, Hirundinidae.  Fairy martins are often known as &quot;bottle swallows&quot; because of the distinctive bottle-shaped mud nests that both sexes construct from mouthfuls of mud or clay that are stuck to solid surfaces such as rock faces on cliffs or in rock crevices. These birds&apos; nest building activities are increasingly focused on manmade objects such as pipes, buildings, the undersides of bridges and in culverts. The nest entrance is a horizontal spout. Both sexes share incubation and chick-rearing duties.  Fairy martins live in open country near water across Australia. They feed on flying insects that they catch on-the-wing high in the air column. They are gregarious, often nesting in colonies and feeding in large mixed flocks with tree swallows. The fairy martin has a rufous crown and nape, an iridescent blue back, dark brown or blackish wings, a whitish or buffy rump and a short blackish tail that is slightly forked although it appears squared-off in flight. The underparts are greyish white. Sexes are similar, but young birds are browner with a pale forehead and pale edges on the back and wing feathers. This species is easily distinguished from other Australian swallows by its pale rump. It can be distinguished from the most similar-looking species, the tree martin, H. nigricans, by the latter&apos;s shallowly forked tail and blue-black head and nape. The fairy martin also has a higher pitched voice than the tree martin.  The behavioural trait that is seen in fairy martins has that is unusual for a bird that breeds so near the equator is seasonal migration. These birds move north (closer to the equator) for the winter and some birds will even fly to New Guinea and to parts of Indonesia. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

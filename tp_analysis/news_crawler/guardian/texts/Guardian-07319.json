    "text": "Studying for a degree from one country while living in another is nothing new: Nelson Mandela famously took his University of London degree while imprisoned on Robben Island. But 2009-10 marked the first year in which more overseas students were studying for British degrees beyond these shores than within them. In January, a report from the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education revealed that there were now more than 200 overseas campuses dotted around the world. Of these, 25 are British: a figure that has doubled in just two years. It&apos;s a trend the universities minister, David Willetts, is keen to encourage. In a speech last June at Stanford University in the US he pointed to the surging demand for higher education in nations such as Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil, adding: &quot;I want to see investors from Britain and abroad helping our universities access these big overseas markets.&quot; But questions remain about whether financiers and universities are ready to work together  and about what form such ventures could take. By the time Willetts gave his speech, in fact, the wheels were already turning. In May, he convened a meeting with private firms, financial investors and vice-chancellors to discuss how to boost universities&apos; overseas presence. And he launched UK Education Services (UKES), a new unit of the business department, with the intention of helping to sell British education suppliers to foreign governments. UKES won&apos;t just push overseas campuses: everything from technology to accreditation is also in its sights. But it could also market a sort of flat-pack higher education system, with campus construction, academic expertise and the finance to pay for it all in a single package. Governments in a hurry to create a new university could use Britain as a one-stop shop. Willetts&apos;s interest in all this is as much economic as educational. He sees higher education as &quot;one of our great export industries&quot;, and wants to use its global reputation to boost the national coffers. Meanwhile, emerging economies increasingly want to educate their students at home, to reduce the risk of a brain drain. Overseas ventures will allow British universities to hang on to lucrative foreign income in the face of changing migration patterns  and unfriendly student visa policies in the UK. Some universities are already moving in this direction. This October, the University of Central Lancashire is launching UCLan Cyprus, the first UK university to set up shop on the island. It is planning UCLan Thailand and UCLan Sri Lanka, too. &quot;Within the next 10 years the face of education will change very significantly,&quot; says Professor Dave Phoenix, the pro-vice chancellor who has led the Cyprus project. &quot;There&apos;s a real opportunity for institutions that want to create a global brand.&quot; However, as big as the opportunity is, universities tend not to think in terms of business transactions. Consultant John Fielden has researched transnational education for organisations including Universities UK and the thinktank Million+. &quot;Most people assume universities [establish branch campuses] for money, but that&apos;s usually the wrong assumption,&quot; he says. In the case of newer universities, it&apos;s often a matter of &quot;securing a supply chain, getting students back to the UK in their third year and hoping they stay on&quot;. For those higher up the league tables, it&apos;s about making a statement about their international reputation. As Professor Drummond Bone, the former Universities UK president who as Liverpool&apos;s vice-chancellor established its Chinese subsidiary, says: &quot;I think if you&apos;re looking at it in terms of short-term profitability, you&apos;re crazy, frankly.&quot; University bosses say the biggest barrier to getting international ventures off the ground is the lack of capital. Two investors  the Ontario Teachers&apos; Pension Fund and investment bank Goldman Sachs  are keen, but so far neither has put its hand in its pocket, perhaps because of a lack of commercial expertise perceived in university management. And some universities aren&apos;t comfortable with the idea of teaming up with investment banks. Until that changes, foreign ventures are likely to remain relatively small, ad hoc affairs, funded largely through local investment. There is a third pitfall: governing bodies are a risk-averse lot, and an overseas venture that offered sub-par teaching could do a university&apos;s reputation more harm than good. And other risks are more tangible. In 2007, Australia&apos;s University of New South Wales opened a Singapore campus. It was meant to serve 15,000 students; actually, it attracted fewer than 150. It closed in a matter of weeks, leaving the university with a bill of over S$22m (11m). The result of all this is that full-blown campuses overseas are likely to remain a relative rarity. Fielden has just completed a report on transnational education for the UK Higher Education International Unit (IU). &quot;Nearly everyone is cooking up something,&quot; he says; but only a minority of institutions are planning branch campuses. The rest are looking instead to research partnerships or franchising arrangements: smaller, less risky ventures that require less money and management time. Others think the most likely outcome of the UKES will be &quot;education city&quot; projects of the sort seen in Malaysia&apos;s Educity Iskandar: campuses established by investors or overseas governments, into which British institutions can just slot a faculty or two. The IU&apos;s director, Joanna Newman, argues that success depends on working closely with existing local institutions: &quot;The old model of us supplying and them taking isn&apos;t going to work.&quot; If the government is serious about boosting higher education exports, there are other things it could do. One is to provide &quot;pump priming&quot; funding to get projects to the stage where investors might take an interest. It could also take on an active matchmaking role, Newman argues, citing a recent IU &quot;speed-dating&quot; event at which British and Brazilian universities could meet each other with a view to finding research partners. Even if the government does all this, though, not everyone in higher education will be jumping for joy. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the university thinktank Million+, argues that the entire debate is a distraction. &quot;This government&apos;s approach contrasts poorly against the previous one, which actually provided funding to boost higher education exports,&quot; she says. &quot;The Home Office visa restrictions are damaging one of the most successful UK export industries. No amount of private capital can compensate for that.&quot; If British universities don&apos;t fill the gap, though, those of other nations will. And the window of opportunity won&apos;t last for ever. Bone says that one of the reasons Liverpool went into China was to hang on to a group of students it otherwise expected to dwindle away. &quot;Ten, 15 years down the line, the attractions for developing countries of sending their young people to high-cost UK education is going to be a lot less, because of the development of their own systems,&quot; he says. By then, those countries will have built their own universities  and won&apos;t need to borrow ours.",

    "headline": "Q&A: Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)", 
    "text": "1 What is Sopa? It is the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill put before the US House of Representatives. Its counterpart in the Senate is Pipa, short for the Protect Intellectual Property Act. If enacted in its present form (which now seems unlikely), the legislation would significantly expand the powers of US law enforcement to combat online trafficking in copyrighted and counterfeitedgoods. 2 What kinds of powers was Sopa set to provide? In a word, sweeping. Companies which claimed that their intellectual property was being appropriated or infringed could request court orders to forbid advertising networks (such as Google) and payment facilities (online services such as PayPal) from conducting business with infringing websites. Complainants could also ban search engines from linking to allegedly infringing sites and could obtain court orders requiring internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to those sites. The proposed legislation would have expanded existing US criminal laws to include the digital streaming of copyright material, with a maximum penalty of five years&apos; jail. 3 Why were these powers being sought? The driving force behind them is undoubtedly the lobbying power of US and international multimedia companies (movie studios, record companies, publishers) concerned about loss of revenue stemming from widespread online piracy. These companies feel that existing US legislation is inadequate to deal with infringing websites that are owned and/or based in other countries. The legislation is also aimed at US-based search engines and other referring services which, proponents say, effectively engage in active promotion of infringing sites. 4 Why has there been such controversy about Sopa?  The main reason is that the powers being sought were not only so sweeping, but that they might cause significant collateral damage. They would permit US law enforcement agencies to block websites at the &quot;domain&quot; level rather than at the level of the allegedly infringing site. In that way, Sopa would interfere with the domain name system (DNS) which is at the heart of the internet. The DNS acts as a kind of phonebook for the network  it&apos;s what translates &quot;www.bbc.co.uk&quot; into the machine-readable address of the BBC  212.58.244.67, for example. If the DNS is barred from providing the address of a particular site, then that site effectively becomes invisible (though technically adept internet users will still be able to find it). 5 Why would DNS blocking be such a bad thing? First, because it would give commercial corporations the power to interfere with the basic architecture of the internet, and in that sense set a very worrying precedent for a network that has become central to our lives and economies. Second, while it might be necessary to do it in some circumstances, DNS-blocking is a very blunt instrument. Most websites are hosted under large umbrella domains. Blogger.com and wordpress.com, to give just two examples, each host tens of thousands of individual blogs. But if either of these blog-hosting sites were DNS-blocked because some individual blogs contravened Sopa, then they would also disappear from the net. The collateral damage in this case would be to freedom of speech, which is why some opponents of the legislation think it contravenes the US constitution. But in fact the impact of Sopa could be even more chilling, because it could also be used to take down services like Google, Twitter and Wikipedia simply because they might be providing links to infringing sites without in any way endorsing them. 6 Is there a real problem with piracy? Yes. There are a lot of sites and services that, for commercial or ideological reasons, are contemptuous of copyright and other forms of intellectual property, and it is reasonable for society to address that problem in intelligent and proportionate ways that do not do more harm than good. But tackling piracy is not easy because one of the defining properties of digital technology is it that it makes it easy to make and distribute perfect copies of digitalgoods. 7 Who has been opposing Sopa? An unprecedentedly broad coalition of industry, activist, engineering and lobbying groups. US legislators seem to have been taken aback by the vehement opposition of the big US technology companies, for example  companies which have traditionally tended to have a relatively low profile in Washington, at least compared with the movie studios and their representatives. The truth is that while the so-called &quot;creative industries&quot; are important, they are economic minnows compared with the technology industries, and realisation of this may have led politicians to backpedal on Sopa. 8 So what happens next? The White House recently issued a statement on the bills, saying it would oppose Pipa and Sopa as written, and emphasised that the president would not support any bill &quot;that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global internet&quot;. On Friday, the Senate and the House of Representatives shelved votes on the bills to enable a rethink. But, as people say in the newspaper business, this one will run and run.",

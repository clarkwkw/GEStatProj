    "text": "One of the 25 new Treasures in the Natural History Museum is an Emperor Penguin egg, collected on the 1910-12 Terra Nova expedition to Antarctica led by Captain Scott. Three men collected the egg: Dr Edward Wilson, Henry &apos;Birdie&apos; Bowers and Apsley Cherry-Garrard. Wilson and Bowers died with Scott, but Cherry-Garrard survived the expedition and later wrote up their experiences in a book called The Worst Journey in the World. The egg is famous in large part because by the time it was analysed back in the UK ideas about evolution and embryology had shifted, and it was no longer quite such a crucial piece of scientific evidence.  Wilson, Bowers and Cherry-Garrard weren&apos;t just doing zoology on their extraordinary journey, they were also doing studies of the weather and human nutrition, but we hear a lot less about this work. The food science was particularly unpleasant. The men tried to survive on a diet consisting predominantly of just one major food group before shifting the proportions of butter, pemmican and biscuit in their rations until they found one that was palatable and helped them man-haul across the snow. All three men came to roughly the same ideal ratio, by weight about 50% carbohydrate, 38% protein, and 12% fat. This experiment is mentioned in Cherry-Garrard&apos;s Worst Journey in the World, and it gets a scant paragraph (without results) in the collected scientific works of the expedition. It was never written up as a paper in a journal, or even a note in a medical publication. This isn&apos;t so surprising, as scientific explorers were as likely to read, and learn from, stories and accounts of past expeditions as they were scientific papers. Scott was particularly keen to speak to people with real experience of working and surviving in extreme environments, and rearranged his Polar team&apos;s rations according to the findings of Wilson, Bowers and Cherry-Garrard. Informal conversations with experts are a great source of information, but they can escape the eye of the modern scientist (as well as the historian). Most scientists who have written a journal article have had to write history  we know it as a literature review, but essentially it&apos;s a kind of history writing, linking events to one another, trying to trace the progress and evolution of an idea over time. Lots of science history consists of little more than extended literature reviews, relying heavily on published work and famous discoveries; these can be incredibly useful, but their biggest weakness is that they often leave out stories like the Antarctic food study which never make it to the traditional published sources. Not inclined to publish? This matters for more recent science too. Here&apos;s an example (it&apos;s based on real experiences but fictionalised to leave informants anonymous!) One day I&apos;m visiting a laboratory and notice that one of the lab-top machines has two of its four legs propped up on a booklet, which turns out to be the instruction leaflet for the staff microwave. This machine analyses small samples of material sent from labs across the institute. One of these labs has just started a new series of experiments which tend to produce samples that are smaller than usual, which means sometimes the machine fails to produce a clear result. Lots of fixes have been tried, but in the end tilting the machine seemed to work best. None of the institution&apos;s publications mention the microwave leaflet, not least because the machine&apos;s test is a tiny, routine part of huge and exciting new experiments. Although it&apos;s not impossible to replicate these results without tipping the machine, many labs may find it difficult, awkward and time consuming. This can affect historians as well as scientists: when Japanese laboratories systematically fail to replicate the results, historians looking back on the discovery are more likely to start explaining that difficulty by talking about different laboratory cultures, or techniques, or training, or even competence. It is very unlikely that we&apos;ll figure out that the real cause is that Japanese microwaves ship with thin single-language instruction manuals, rather than the thick multi-language leaflets that come with European and North American purchases. I&apos;m not blaming the scientists in the laboratory for not mentioning the tilted machine in their papers: there&apos;s no way any scientific journal article could contain every little detail of an experiment  in fact choosing what is and is not relevant is an enormous philosophical and practical puzzle. Many of the scientists sending samples off to be tested probably didn&apos;t even know the machine had been altered in the first place. It&apos;s not as if anyone kept the fix secret. Visitors and graduate students took the knowledge with them to other laboratories, it was discussed at the bar at conferences, and one lab technician asked a question about it on a widely-used mailing list. By now I suspect that everyone using this machine knows that sometimes it needs to be tilted, or will be told so pretty soon after they start using it. The knowledge is out there, and it has been shared and disseminated without ever being published in a journal or a book Deciding what to remember It&apos;s a clich that when academics are asked a simple question they say &quot;oh, but it&apos;s more complicated than that!&quot; When historians of science fall back on this line we&apos;re probably worrying about &apos;lost&apos; food studies or tilted machines or casual conversations in pubs, and all the thousands of unmentioned and unrecorded things that make science possible, but can be almost impossible to uncover. Scientists and the public instinctively know this stuff matters too  perhaps this is why books like James Watson&apos;s The Double Helix are so popular (and controversial!) because they tell the stories that never make it into textbooks and articles. You won&apos;t find out what an Antarctic instrument technician eats when you read about studies at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (it&apos;s probably not pemmican). Yet a well-designed diet might be as crucial to her successful completion of scientific work as any optical sensor or data modelling programme. Should her diet, or even her brand of thermal underwear, be mentioned in her physics paper? Or is that a fact for historians, rather than scientists, to worry about?",

    "text": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team UK court rules against Motorola&apos;s &quot;sync messages&quot; patent &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  On Friday, the High Court in London issued a ruling that said that one of Motorola&apos;s patents covering technology to synchronize messages across several devices should be invalidated. Originally, the patent covered the synching of messages across multiple pagers, but recently Motorola has used the patent in lawsuits against Apple and Microsoft for using similar message-syncing services in iCloud and on the Xbox, respectively.  The presiding Judge Richard Arnold declared Motorola&apos;s patent invalid and said it should be revoked because the patent (which has a priority date from 1995, but was issued in 2002) contained technology that &quot;was obvious to experts in the field at the time.&quot;   Microsoft brought the case - Exchange and ActiveSync would have infringed. But it&apos;s stil in force in Germany. And in the US. (Though Motorola&apos;s patent value just fell a little.) Google finds its design voice on iOS &gt;&gt; The Next Web  Google doesn&apos;t just make apps for Android and the web. It also makes them for Apple&apos;s iOS -- 25 different apps at last count. That&apos;s more apps than Apple offers on its own store. Unfortunately, when it comes to design on the iPhone and iPad, its offerings have left a lot to be desired. That is until recently when, suddenly, its apps started getting very, very good.  BT faces 94m in repayments for overcharging &gt;&gt; PC Pro  BT is facing repayments to its wholesale customers of nearly 100 million after Ofcom ruled the company had been overcharging them.  In a ruling that covers three separate complaints from a host of ISPs, Ofcom found that the prices charged by BT for its Ethernet services around five years ago were too high... The ruling explains that Sky and TalkTalk jointly raised a dispute over pricing for BT&apos;s Backhaul Extension Services (BES), arguing that between June 2004 and July 2009 &quot;BT had failed to comply with its obligations to ensure that its charges for BES were cost orientated&quot;.  Google designing &apos;X Phone&apos; to rival Apple, Samsung &gt;&gt; WSJ.com  The [Motorola] deal complicates Google&apos;s mission to advance Android. Hardware makers typically install a version of the operating system that comes attached with Google&apos;s revenue-generating services such as Google Search, Google Maps and Chrome browser.  Samsung, with its popular &quot;Galaxy&quot; devices, is the biggest such partner and is quickly gaining market share. The South Korean company shipped 40.3% of all Android-based phones in the third quarter, according to IDC. Google has co-developed devices with Samsung and provided it early access to new versions of Android software.  Some Google executives have expressed fears the relationship could go sour if Samsung decided to use a &quot;forked&quot; version of Android, according to four people familiar with the matter. That means Samsung would create devices based on a version of Android that doesn&apos;t come with Google apps preinstalled.  Motorola is seen as a kind of insurance policy if Samsung shifts strategy, these people said, even though there is little evidence so far of such a move. Google could begin adopting an integrated approach of having its Motorola and Android units work more closely together, like Apple does with its hardware and software teams, they said.   The idea of Motorola rivalling Apple or Samsung is presently ludicrous: those two companies have billions sunk in manufacturing and supply chains. Motorola is a minnow by comparison; it will take a long time and huge investment to really rival them. Is Google prepared for that? (Subscription may be required.) The dark nature of Google&apos;s business ... and self-driving cars &gt;&gt; ZDNet Tom Foremski:   For a taste of the complexity of Google&apos;s world, and everyone that&apos;s trying to make money in that world, take a look at this infographic from SEOBook attempting to explain the many different strategies that Google uses when updating its search algorithm.  Google&apos;s goal is to confuse search engine optimization (SEO) efforts and to uncover aggressive SEO techniques through delaying, or obfuscating results from SEO changes being made.  By making it harder to link a change in a web site, with the resulting change in search rank, Google believes it can fight SEO and clean up its search rankings.  Unfortunately, it also means that a lot of legitimate online businesses can lose rank overnight and lose revenues for no fault of theirs but due to clumsy algorithm changes that favor big brands and big business.  The past couple of years of algorithm changes have been very hard on small online businesses, and forums are full of heart breaking stories of decimated revenues and job cuts.  Press Release - Antitrust: European Commission sends Statement of Objections to Samsung on potential misuse of mobile phone standard-essential patents &gt;&gt; EC  The European Commission has informed Samsung of its preliminary view that Samsung&apos;s seeking of injunctions against Apple in various Member States on the basis of its mobile phone standard-essential patents (&quot;SEPs&quot;) amounts to an abuse of a dominant position prohibited by EU antitrust rules. While recourse to injunctions is a possible remedy for patent infringements, such conduct may be abusive where SEPs are concerned and the potential licensee is willing to negotiate a licence on Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (so-called &quot;FRAND&quot;) terms. The sending of a Statement of Objections does not prejudge the final outcome of the investigation.   Comparatively rapid: case was opened in January 2012. Fine: can be up to 10% of company&apos;s annual worldwide turnover. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales denies Kazakhstan connection &gt;&gt; Examiner.com  Over the past 48 hours, something very strange and disturbing has been panning out on one of Wikipedia&apos;s most popular pages - the Talk page of the project&apos;s co-founder, Jimmy Wales. Accusations have been leveled about the Wikimedia Foundation (which Wales created), saying that the non-profit organization is working too closely with the government of Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan&apos;s president has been the target of many worldwide criticisms for his authoritarian crackdowns on free speech in the former Soviet republic. The Kazakh government funds a new wiki-focused project in that country, called WikiBilim.  Wales sounded off on Friday:  &quot;The Wikimedia Foundation has zero collaboration with the government of Kazakhstan.&quot;   And more.  UK &amp; Ireland: November ISP rankings for UK and Ireland &gt;&gt; The Official Netflix Blog  Our 30 million members view over 1 billion hours of Netflix per month, so we have very reliable data for consumers to compare ISPs in terms of real world performance.  Starting this month, we&apos;ll publish monthly rankings of ISPs in the UK and Ireland, based upon their actual performance across all Netflix streams.   None is anything to write home about, to be honest. Method and System for Exposing Multi-Billion Dollar Racketeering Scheme &gt;&gt; Plainsite  Intellectual Ventures is not run by amateurs, of course. In the same way that no one has actually ever seen Keyser Sze, the ficticious Hungarian mafioso described in the film The Usual Suspects, few companies have been sued by Intellectual Ventures. But its agents, or in this case, shell corporations, are legendary. Everyone knows they are out there, but no one seems to know who they are.  That is because to the best of our knowledge, until now, there has been no publicly available list of Intellectual Ventures shell corporations, unless you count the USPTO assignment database, which contains millions of other records as well. In fact, in response to recent queries about their shell corporations, Intellectual Ventues stated, &quot;Those interested in viewing granted patents and patent applications can search the USPTO&apos;s public database.&quot;  So that&apos;s what we did.  Like all of the USPTO&apos;s on-line systems, the assignment database is a technological abomination--sadly ironic for the agency that effectively manages the nation&apos;s technology rights.   Apple kills a Kickstarter project: Portable power project POP refunding $139,170 to backers &gt;&gt; VentureBeat  POP was billed as &quot;the intersection between charging and design&quot; and featured connectors to charge iPads, iPhones, and yes ... Android devices. Its four retractable cord reels would have powered anything using micro-USB charging connectors.  That&apos;s a problem with Apple. In fact, even combining Apple&apos;s new Lighting connector with the old 30-pin connector in a charging device was verboten; Apple would not approve, forcing the team to abandon the project.  &quot;We are pissed,&quot; Edison Junior CEO Jamie Siminoff told me on the phone today. &quot;I think they are being a bunch of assholes, and I think they&apos;re hurting their customers.&quot;  You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

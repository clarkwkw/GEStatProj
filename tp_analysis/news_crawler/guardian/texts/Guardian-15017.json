    "text": "So I get in this one, put on the radio  5 Live  and there&apos;s a story about pandas. Honest. There&apos;s my way in, I&apos;m thinking, always on the lookout fora way to make a car review not too car-reviewy (or more ignorant, say my detractors). Perhaps I can ingeniously tie my report in with thenews. It&apos;s about the pandas at Edinburgh zoo  you know, Mrs Tian Tian andMr Yang Guan. He was totally up for it, she totally wasn&apos;t; stay away, bamboo breath, she said, in Pandarin Chinese. So now they&apos;ve gone and done her artificially. And I&apos;m thinking artificial insemination, fuel injection, this is diesel (it also comes with Fiat&apos;s eco Twin Air petrol engine), so there could be something in that. Also 4x4, 4x4 play, perhaps that&apos;s where Yang Guan was going wrong, not enough of that. Or paw by paw Nah, this isnot going to work, is it? Drop it, right now. OK, time to come clean. The reason I&apos;m beating about the thicket here is because I didn&apos;t give this one a proper testing. It&apos;s primarily a city car, and I did drive it round a city. Like its two-wheel drive sibling, it&apos;s terrific around town  cheap (actually not that cheap at all in this form), cheerful, charming even. They&apos;ve added plastic cladding to protect it from bumps and to give a more rugged appearance. And raised it a few cm; it leans a bit on the corners, not alarmingly so. Youwouldn&apos;t want to go too fast onthe open road, especially inacrosswind, but luckily it doesn&apos;t gotoo fast. Most significantly, of course, it has four-wheel drive that engages when required, diverting up to half of the torque (don&apos;t worry if you don&apos;t understand, it&apos;s a bit like off-side) to the rear wheels. Plusthere&apos;s something called Traction+, which helps traction at low speeds by sensing wheelspin. All of which means that this little baby  like its predecessors, and unlike most so-called crossovers and SUVs hasgenuine off-road capability. Byall accounts Yes, I&apos;m afraid I didn&apos;t go off-road in it myself. Well, to be honest, it&apos;s hard to find anywhere around here to do so. I certainly didn&apos;t need to. And it does sort of beg the question: how many people need a car that can go up or down slopes most drivers would be terrified of, but that is also easy to park and agileround town? Still, even if you&apos;re never going to do it, there&apos;s something quite reassuring about knowing you can. And knowing that if this little Panda was (re)introduced to the wild, it would have a good chance ofsurvival. Ha, it wasn&apos;t elegant, butwe got back to them in the end.

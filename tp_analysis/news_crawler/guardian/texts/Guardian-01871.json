    "text": "A co-founder of Twitter has told its 500 million users not to spend hours on the micro-blogging site because it is &quot;unhealthy&quot;. Biz Stone, Twitter&apos;s creative director, said users should visit the site for information but leave once they had found it. At a business conference in Montreal, Canada, Stone, 37, said that using Twitter for hours at a time &quot;sounds unhealthy&quot;. &quot;I like the kind of engagement where you go to the website and you leave because you&apos;ve found what you are looking for or you found something very interesting and you learned something,&quot; he told the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal on Wednesday. &quot;I think that&apos;s a much healthier engagement. Obviously, we want you to come frequently.&quot; The social networking guru, also said there were no plans to increase Twitter&apos;s 140-character limit, according to the Montreal Gazette.",

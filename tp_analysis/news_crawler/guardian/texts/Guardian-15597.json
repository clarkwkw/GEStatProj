    "text": "Tim Radford (Lost in space, G2, 21 May) repeats the story that the astronomer royal, Sir Richard Woolley, had described space travel as &quot;utter bilge&quot;, implying a lack of vision on behalf of the British establishment. I met Woolley when he came to talk to Liverpool University&apos;s Astronomical Society soon after the Apollo moon missions and asked him his views on space travel. He held to the same opinion, as he said he was talking about interstellar and intergalactic travel, which had been all the rage in science fiction circles in 1956. Given the enormous distances involved, the time for a journey could be measured in lifetimes, not years. To go to the moon is (only) a quarter of a million miles, whereas just writing down the distance to the stars would involve so many zeros that the editor would not allow this letter into the paper. Writing the distance to the furthest galaxies would require most of the paper to be filled with zeros. &quot;Utter bilge&quot; is a reasonable description of such flights of fancy.Frank LargeLiverpool",

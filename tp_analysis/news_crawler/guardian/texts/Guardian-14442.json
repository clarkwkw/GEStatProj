    "text": "A selection of links, hand-picked by the Guardian&apos;s games writers. CVG UK Blog: BioShock Infinite is &apos;horrendous&apos;, claims indie dev - but why? - CVG UK Dan Dawkins tackles the seemingly unstoppable Bioshock: Infinite backlash, the debate now centering on a Tweet from indie developer Kris Piotrowski, who wrote, &quot;I am worried that there was almost ZERO critical discussion of the game, when the game is so charged with problematic content. You should have heard a lot more about what is wrong with it. A lot more.&quot; Dawkins:   What&apos;s really interesting is how Piotrowski&apos;s comments - albeit inadvertently - highlight the widening chasm between some AAA and indie games developer. It often feels like a subset of journalists and forum posters take glee in the latest major financial disaster, or enforced CEO departures. Conversely, some indie games are so disproportionately praised, you&apos;re made to feel like a porridge-chugging simpleton for even half-enjoying Warhammer 40k: Space Marine.  Violent games can enable would-be mass murderers, say CA Senator | GameSpot.com   Democratic California Senator Dianne Feinstein has again spoken out against violent video games. Today on MSNBC&apos;s Morning Joe, Feinstein said these games can be enablers for would-be mass murderers. &quot;I think the really violent video game becomes a kind of simulator to practice on. And it enables the individual to become much more familiar with that depiction of death and blood,&quot; Feinstein said, referencing the exaggerated way in which some games depict violence and death. &quot;Of course it&apos;s not the way it is in real life,&quot; she added. During an event last week, Feinstein said violent games play a &quot;very negative role for young people.&quot; She said if the game industry continues to make games that glorify guns, Congress may intervene.   There is a lot of this talk swirling around US politics again. The timing is... interesting... what with a gun control bill passing through. Here&apos;s everything you can pay for in action-RPG Dungeon Hunter 4 | Pocket Gamer Mark Brown:  The in-app purchases in Gameloft&apos;s latest hack &apos;n&apos; slash Diablo-like game Dungeon Hunter 4 are really something else. In this game, the French studio employs an &quot;if you can see it, you can buy it&quot; system, encouraging you to pay for new weapons, better skills, more health, extra potions, instant revival, and more inventory slots. And then you can take your ill-gotten gains online and best all those poor peasants in the free-for-all arena.  Brown then goes on to list all the microtransaction possibilities in the game, making a rather damning statement about Gameloft&apos;s free-to-play mechanics. Clifford Unchained - &quot;Deal With It&quot; Cliff Bleszinski deals with the whole situation around EA employee Adam Orth who told Twitter uses to &apos;deal with it&apos; in reference to our &apos;always online&apos; future  and then promptly left the company.  My gut is telling me that an always online future is probably coming. It&apos;s coming fast, and possibly to the majority of the devices you enjoy. Adam&apos;s analogies weren&apos;t that far off; although the vacuum one was kind of weird. Sim City, with all of its&apos; troubles on launch, seems to be selling briskly. Diablo 3, the poster child of a messy launch, is estimated to be at 12 million units. (Remember the internet rage over the art style shift? I barely do. But it seemed so important at the time!) I would bet money that without the always online elements of Diablo 3 that it would have sold half of that.  EA: &quot;Gaming isn&apos;t mass market yet&quot; | GamesIndustry International  &quot;We have to make sure that game companies know what a mass market really is. We&apos;re not one yet,&quot; Hilleman says when we meet after his talk. &quot;The closest thing we&apos;ve had to a mass market, frankly, has been the social and mobile spaces. From my perspective, television is the mass market and we&apos;re the fringe. The challenge in front of us is, does the customer think about it that way? Do they see us as so distinct we can&apos;t merge those two experiences?&quot;  EA Mobile suffers heavy layoffs, publisher refutes studio&apos;s closure | MCV  Significant layoffs have hit EA, specifically affecting hundreds of employees at EA Mobile Montreal. Gamasutra first reported the redundancies, with a Montreal-based source telling the site that around 200 to 250 jobs were lost. EA has since swooped in to refute that claim, stating that the number is too high  though it wasn&apos;t made clear by how much. The publisher also denied rumours that the studio will close. EA has released a statement explaining the layoffs are part of a streamlining effort, as the company looks to &apos;sharpen&apos; its focus on providing games for mobile and other new platforms.  Xbox 360 News: Rumour: four next gen Xbox launch titles | The Official Magazine  Crytek&apos;s Roman-era punch-&apos;em-up Ryse and Microsoft&apos;s own next-gen Forza are both rumoured to be launch titles for the putative and unconfirmed (but daft if it doesn&apos;t happen) next generation Xbox (itself rumoured to be announced at the end of May.)  The others are meant to be a zombie game and a, &quot;family game set on an island with Pixar-quality graphics&quot;. Okaaaaay... Zombie Mondo Monday | Plymouth Arts Centre Had to sneak this in: Plymouth Arts Centre is doing a regular Monday slot of cult movies and next week it&apos;s a double bill of undead classics: Reanimator and Zombie Flesh Eaters.

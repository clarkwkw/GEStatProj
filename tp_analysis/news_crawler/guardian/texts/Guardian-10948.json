    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view While telling the abridged saga of The Lord Of The Rings, the LEGO version retains bits of dialogue from the films, replacing Sean Bean, Sir Ian McKellen et al with small, surprisingly expressive mini-figures. Watching the momentary panic on their tiny plastic faces as everything turns to slapstick chaos makes even the non-interactive elements of the story a delight to witness. For the rest of the time you&apos;ll be indulging in the LEGO game staples of smashing everything you see into its component pieces, finding secret collectible treasures and solving neat, straightforward puzzles that give each character their moment in the limelight. Plus, once the story&apos;s complete, you can head off and explore the good old Shire and the rest of Middle Earth.",

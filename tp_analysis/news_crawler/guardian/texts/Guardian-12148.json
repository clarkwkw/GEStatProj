    "text": "November&apos;s student protests left the National Union of Students (NUS) in an uncomfortable position. Apathy and anger characterised the march. Not only was there a miserable turnout  4,000 students, rather than the 6,000 that had been hoped for  but it ended on a tragic note as president Liam Burns was pelted with eggs and fruit. Some blame the failure on wet weather but Burns himself acknowledges: &quot;We&apos;ve got to get better at campaigning.&quot; It&apos;s clear that the union needs to improve its image among students. When I asked students on Twitter what they thought of the organisation, responses were overwhelmingly negative. &quot;I don&apos;t feel like the NUS associates itself with actual students, I have no idea what they do, and little interest in finding out,&quot; says Louise, from York. Others acknowledge its importance but add that it&apos;s a magnet for &quot;weak career-politicians-in-waiting&quot;. Such views certainly clash with the NUS&apos; perception of itself: &quot;the definitive national voice of students&quot;. Of course, the NUS isn&apos;t as irrelevant as its most scathing critics might like to suggest. The problem is that people don&apos;t know about half of its policies. High-profile tuition fee protests have shaped its image, detracting from the union&apos;s other campaigns, many of which are successfully improving student experience. The range of policies on the agenda this year proves how broad the NUS&apos; role actually is. Fees and funding remain a priority, but there are also campaigns to improve childcare and study timetables. Out in Sport, a report that detailed the experiences of LGBT students involved in university sports clubs, has prompted a drive to tackle homophobia on campus. The NUS prides itself on its democratic roots, promising: &quot;our policies and priorities must be student-led through open democratic structures&quot;. In April, this principle will be put into practice as the organisation holds its annual conference in Sheffield, when student leaders will vote on future policies. But as 1,500 delegates trek up to Sheffield, most students will probably be oblivious to the day&apos;s events. The problem doesn&apos;t lie with the organisation&apos;s democratic structure  each university&apos;s delegates are voted for by students, so it&apos;s fair to say that NUS policy is &quot;student-led&quot;  it&apos;s the fact that delegates rarely interact with the student body. And that, perhaps consequently, few people turn out to vote. Those who are involved with policy-making are &quot;usually the minority&quot;, as Rita Serghis of Kingston University&apos;s students&apos; union put it. Student politics, at every level, is made up of a core of engaged students, that often excludes the majority. This is partly down to apathy, and partly because student politics is used as a route into professional politics. The former is unavoidable (apathy is a widespread issue) and the latter is reasonable (most non-academic activity at university takes place with the intention of improving prospects). In the year ahead, if the NUS wants to represent its members properly and turn negative opinions around, it needs to make its lesser known, but more tangible policies prominent. Fees and funding are unquestionably important to students, but they are tired issues that are weighing the NUS down. Drawing attention to topical problems  like lad culture and homophobia  might help the NUS strike a chord with the people it hopes to represent.",

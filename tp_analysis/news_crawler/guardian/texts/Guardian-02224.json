    "text": "At issue in your article (UK wants renewable energy target scrapped, 12March) is what new EU targets should be put in place for 2030. The UK is one of a number of countries that believe any new targets should be technology-neutral, leaving member states free to determine the most cost-effective energy mix to get the best deal for consumers. Our communication to the European commission explicitly states that the UK is not in any way &quot;against renewables&quot;. Far from it  renewables will play a key role in the future UK energy mix, helping to reduce import dependency and meet our carbon targets. But the consumer will be best served in the longterm through all low-carbon energy technologies competing freely to meet our energy needs and emission-reduction targets.Edward Davey MPEnergy and climate change secretary  The news that the UK government is secretly lobbying the European commission for the abolition of future EU renewable energy targets sadly comes asno surprise, and merely reveals the scale of the challenge facing supporters of clean, green power. Coalition ministers have shown little appetite for meeting the UK&apos;s 2020 target: indeed, rather then take positive steps to boost, encourage and support burgeoning green technologies, which have created thousands of new jobs and made an important contribution to climate change goals, the government has instead penalised those that have thrived. Attention has now turned to onshore wind, for which there is huge potential in the UK. Last week the UK government supported ambitious targets in the EU 2050 energy roadmap, but we know from experience that a voluntary, market approach does not give the necessary clarity or impetus for the required investment. &quot;Sign up and hope&quot; is not apolicy. We are told that straitened public finances mean that subsidies for green energy are no longer affordable, but stepping up our ambition on emission reductions makes sense for our energy policy, and economic sense in terms of green growth and jobs too. Frankly, no other solution will do.Jean Lambert MEPGreen, LondonKeith Taylor MEPGreen, South East England  Your report was correct to assume that Lib Dems would oppose allowing nuclear energy to be given parity with renewables for the purposes of meeting European targets, but the situation is more complex than it implies. When the Lib Dems last had a full debate on nuclear energy, the majority opposed it. However, since then, circumstances have changed. The climate is changing faster than we expected, our progress on replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy systems is slower than hoped for, efficiency measures are not reducing demand fast enough, and fossil fuel supplies are becoming less reliable and more difficult to procure. The party&apos;s current stated position is opposition to spending taxpayers&apos; money on nuclear power stations. The cases for and against another generation of nuclear power stations were debated in the summer 2011 edition of Challenge, the journal of the Green Lib Dems (an organisation of party members with a special interest in environmental issues). While continuing to believe that increasing the use of renewable energy has to be our primary objective, an increasing numbers of Lib Dems think that the need to combat climate change is so urgent that we need both renewables and nuclear energy. The development of nuclear and renewable energy technologies were both emaciated by competition from cheap, polluting, unsustainable fossil fuels. We need to look to the future with a set of EU-wide targets that allow the development of renewables and other low-carbon energy production technologies. The proportion of energy production that each EU member state could reasonably be expected to provide from renewables depends on climate, topography and population density. The next set of EU targets need to further increase the proportion of energy required to be produced from renewables, but to be achievable by all it will have to be lower than the maximum some states could achieve. I would thus support a further requirement for low-carbon energy, which member states could fulfil with further renewables or with other low-carbon sources such as nuclear.Steve BolterMember of Green Lib Dems executive  As we approach another drought, (Report, 12 March), consider August 1666, when the Thames at Oxford was reduced to a trickle The great fire of London started early on 12 September, and the east wind drove the flames before it, burning much of London and spreading smoke as far as Oxford. In 2007 a nuclear power station site was still proposed at Didcot on the Thames; even when in &quot;down mode&quot; a nuclear power station requires around 3MW of cooling to keep the fuel rods stable. In August 2011 Dominique Bestion, research director of the French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission, said he foresaw no new inland nuclear power stations being built because of climate change. He cited the experience of France, where they increasingly have to put their nuclear plants into sleep mode on rivers such asthe Loire. In the summer of 2003, when 15,000 people died in the heatwave in France, three of the Loire plants were shut down and blackouts ensued. In response France installed over 200MW of distributed photovoltaics to meet summer peak demands, when such inland nuclear plants fail to generate. Nuclear energy in a rapidly warming climate, with more extreme weather, is unsafe, whether inland or by the sea. We already have the technology to build a safe and sufficient renewable energy future at much lower costs. The question is, who is actually stopping us doing it?Professor Susan RoafEdinburgh  Your welcome article on Fukushima (Report, 9 March) sadly repeats the mantra that for cumulative doses below 100mSv: &quot;No study has linked cancer development to exposure at below that level.&quot; I hope the Guardian will not fall for the reassurances of the nuclear industry so easily. The low-dose radiation debate has a long history, including the pioneering work of the late Alice Stewart, who discovered the link between exposure to diagnostic X-rays in utero and increased risk of childhood cancer. The peer-reviewed open-access journal Environmental Health has published two articles of mine (2007, 2009) on radiation risks for cancer mortality in Japanese A-bomb survivors exposed to under 20 mSv external doses.Greg DropkinLiverpool  I have just heard that the energy regulator Ofgem has given the energy giant EDF a rap over the knuckles for mis-selling (Report, 9 March). EDF has apparently agreed to pay 4.5m to its vulnerable customers in lieu of a fine. Surely, if this hugely profitable company has been contravening the rules on selling, it should be fined. This &quot;in lieu of a fine&quot; agreement seems to me to let the company off the PR hook and allow them to spin bad practice as a generous gesture to their vulnerable customers. Last November a French court fined the same company, EDF, 1.3m (1.5m) for spying on Greenpeace in France, sent two senior EDF employees to prison for three years and awarded Greenpeace damages from the company. This seems like an honest and transparent way of dealing with a company that has broken laws. This weekend, a large number of people are expressing their opposition to plans to build new nuclear reactors in the UK by surrounding the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point on the Bristol Channel. This is the first site where our prime minister recently announced preliminary work would start on a new reactor as part of a joint Anglo-French deal. Guess which energy company will be doing this work? EDF. If this company cannot abide by our regulations on fair selling and falls foul of French law when it has concerns about those who oppose its plans, should we really trust it to build and run nuclear plants, which have the potential to experience some of the most hazardous accidents on the planet? I am opposed to further expansion of nuclear power, but if our government insists on this course, surely it should at least go out to competitive tender.Dr Julia SpraggOxford",

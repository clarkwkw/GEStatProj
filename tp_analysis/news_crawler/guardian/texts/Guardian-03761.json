    "text": "Zombies are rarely a sign of originality in a game, tending to signify the last gasp of a desperate developer  but Rebuild (app store, Sarah Northway, 1.99) is different. This indie title was originally a free flash game, but has now come to iOS where it deserves to be a big success. A zombie apocalypse/ FarmVille mash-up, Rebuild presents the player as leader of the last remnants of humanity following the inevitable undead uprising. Choose a look for your avatar, as well as a tool  think pistol or dog  to help determine what kind of boss you become. At the start there is just a ragtag collection of fellow survivors with different specialities to assign tasks to  scavenging, farming, killing &quot;the Zed&quot;, recruiting new members and reclaiming buildings  but there are various ways to win, whether escaping by helicopter or writing a new constitution. It&apos;s resource management with a rotting-corpse twist. Moving in the other direction, popular paid-for app iSlash now has a freemium offering, as well as a multiplayer update for the pay version (Duello, 69p/free, iOS &amp; Android). It&apos;s a simple title  slash off segments of a piece of ornately carved wood, the challenge coming in making sure you keep the ninja stars that rattle about within the wood structure together, but also without touching them. Although easy at first, by level 20 it&apos;s nerve-shredding. Multiplayer works well, turn-based play with Jenga-like deviousness, making it worth the extra cost.",

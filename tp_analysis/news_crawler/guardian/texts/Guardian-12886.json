    "text": "Dead Space returns, bringing with it a shift from dark and claustrophobic spaceships to an ice world. For the most part the change works well  having the horrifying Necromorphs leap out from a blizzard can be every bit as scary as from a ventilation duct. Another largely positive change is an enhancedweapons-crafting system. Some truly powerful gadgets can be created, ones that are gratifying in their monster-slaying capabilities, but an over-reliance on grinding for components sours the experience somewhat. Adding an atmosphere-shattering co-op mode is a change that falls flat. As soon as someone is fighting alongside you, fear dissipates and the game becomes about shooting the hell out of anything that moves, rather than cautiously progressing lest some unspeakable terror tears you apart. The result is a complete tonal shift. The previous games bore comparison with Alien, with series hero Isaac Clarke, like Ripley, isolated. Dead Space 3, though, is more Aliens  action-focused with only occasional horror elements. And while the latter was a brilliant sequel, Dead Space 3 doesn&apos;t live up to its legacy. It&apos;s good, yes, but it should have been great. ",

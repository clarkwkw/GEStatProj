    "text": "The Department for International Development (DfID) has underlined its commitment to greater private sector investment in the developing world by announcing a 13-year social impact investment programme in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. The DfID impact fund  managed by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the UK&apos;s development finance arm, in partnership with the Global Impact Investment Network  will make up to 75m available to the private sector for health, education, agriculture and utilities projects. The scheme aims to create wealth in some of the world&apos;s poorest countries through impact investment, a financial mechanism designed to generate demonstrable social benefits alongside income. Private investors are being invited to submit proposals to the CDC outlining what they intend to do, how much it will cost, and what the likely social and financial impact will be. Awards will be tied to specified development outcomes; no targets are being set on financial returns, but there is a minimum expectation that investors will return any capital provided under the scheme once projects are complete. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, said the initiative  which reinforces the coalition government&apos;s commitment to increased private-sector involvement in poverty alleviation  would &quot;kickstart private investment and help the poorest on their path out of poverty&quot;. Andrew Rogerson, senior research associate at the Overseas Development Institute, welcomed the initiative. &quot;In principle, anything that uses, creatively, business discipline allied with the power of social objectives is a good idea,&quot; he said. &quot;If it&apos;s done well  and we don&apos;t know an awful lot about how to do it, although there are success stories, such as M-Pesa  then it&apos;s a good way of using what is not a phenomenal amount of money by DfID&apos;s standards. &quot;I think DfID will be quite serious in asking for evidence that outcomes are both visible and fairly distributed. And DfID is pretty data hungry as far as results are concerned; the last thing it would do is look only at the inputs it finances and not care about the outcomes.&quot; Lawrence Haddad, director at the Institute of Development Studies, said: &quot;We should remember that the private sector is already responsible for delivering many services in health and education in the developing world. DfID&apos;s support to develop and grow impact investments is welcomed if [the funds] do not divert resources away from the poorest, if their governance is transparent and inclusive, and if rigorous impact studies are commissioned to evaluate whether the investments will actually deliver positive impacts for poor people and not only a return on investment.&quot; However, John Hilary, executive director of the anti-poverty group War on Want, which this week published a report criticising the amount of UK aid being channelled through public-private investment funds based in tax havens, was more sceptical. He said the programme should be seen within the wider context of the coalition government&apos;s decision to increase international aid to 0.7% of gross national income next year. &quot;This idea is part and parcel of the fact that DfID has got more money than it knows what do with,&quot; said Hilary. &quot;It&apos;s about DfID having an enormous war chest despite having cut more and more staff in its own headquarters. How do you spend hundreds of millions of pounds of new money if you&apos;ve just got rid of all your staff? Their answer, which is the ideological heartland of DfID under the Conservatives, is to give it to the private sector.&quot; The areas targeted by the fund, including public healthcare and utilities, are incompatible with private investment, argued Hilary. &quot;The idea that finance capital can provide the inspiration for the transformation of health and education services in the global south has been proved to be a complete nonsense,&quot; he said. &quot;Healthcare, particularly, doesn&apos;t work in the same way as small-scale businesses. Countries need integrated health systems that do not have the private sector hiving off all of the profits. Having the private sector coming in and setting up parallel programmes destroys health systems in the global south.&quot; The role of the CDC, which has been criticised for focusing on financial gain rather than tackling poverty, is also likely to attract scrutiny. DfID, however, sets great store by the new business plan agreed with the CDC. Under the terms of the plan, the organisation&apos;s performance will be closely monitored and assessed, and data published online. Officials point out that the CDC this year became the first development finance institution to sign up to the International Aid Transparency Initiative. &quot;The reforms will help them direct their capital better, fostering economic growth in countries which need it most,&quot; said a DfID spokesman. &quot;We will also develop industry-wide standard measurements for investments which measure financial return as well as development outcomes to make investment easier and transparent.&quot; According to Hilary, however, DfID&apos;s emphasis on improved governance misses the point: &quot;Aid agencies bang on about transparency and accountability but if, fundamentally, your aid is going to projects that are undermining some of the most important public utilities and anti-poverty programmes in the global south, it doesn&apos;t matter that they&apos;re accountable and transparent  they&apos;re doing the wrong thing.&quot; The impact fund will make 50m available for investment across sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, with a further 25m available for specific countries (Zambia, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Kenya and Mozambique). Between three and seven projects will be supported annually, with a maximum of 15m committed in any single year.",

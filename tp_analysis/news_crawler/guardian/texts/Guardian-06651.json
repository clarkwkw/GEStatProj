    "text": "A UK government fund that supports conflict prevention meets some of the criteria for effectiveness and value for money, but is not performing well and has struggled to demonstrate strategic impact, according to an independent report (pdf). The conflict pool, which had a budget of 256m in 2011-12, is managed jointly by the Foreign Office (FCO), the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Combining official assistance and non-aid money, the fund was created to provide a &quot;joined-up&quot; approach to conflict prevention, drawing on the expertise of the three departments. The fund has fallen short of such laudable aims in practice, according to the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai), which was set up by DfID last year to review the impact and value for money of UK aid. Icai assesses the fund as amber-red, indicating that it needs significant improvements. The conflict pool has delivered some useful, if localised, results, said the report. However, it lacks a clear strategic framework and &quot;robust funding model&quot;, and its governance and management arrangements are cumbersome. It has little capacity for measuring results. Icai said the task of administering the conflict pool by consensus across three departments is so challenging that those responsible for managing it &quot;have tended to shy away from harder strategic issues&quot;. While describing the fund as a useful and important mechanism, Icai said significant reform is required for the fund to fulfil its potential. The conflict pool, which evolved from funds set up in 2000-01, covers Africa, the Middle East and north Africa, south Asia, Europe, and Afghanistan  which absorbs 38% of the fund&apos;s resources (75m in 2010-11). The objective of promoting a coherent and multidisciplinary approach to conflict prevention was novel and ambitious, but has been only partially achieved, said Icai, partly because the pool operated without an overarching strategy document until the adoption of the Building stability overseas strategy in July last year. Even then, there has been a tendency for the three departments to divide the resources between them, rather than work together. &quot;We saw few examples of activities that were genuinely multidisciplinary in nature. We also found only limited contribution by the conflict pool to improving overall strategic coherence across the departments,&quot; said Icai. More recent developments have superseded the conflict pool&apos;s attempts at governmental coherence, such as the creation of the national security council and joint delivery plans for strategically important countries. &quot;With the conflict pool no longer the sole or even primary instrument for conflict prevention, it needs to be clear about its role and comparative advantage and to concentrate its resources accordingly,&quot; said Icai. On the difficulty in reaching agreement between the FCO, DfID and the MoD, the report said one option is for a single department to lead on the management and implementation of specific activities. &quot;Were the FCO to be selected (in the light of its increasingly prominent role in conflict pool management and DfID&apos;s increasing disengagement from a direct spending role) it would have to increase significantly its investment in both management capacity and technical advisory resources,&quot; said Icai. Money is allocated initially from the Treasury to DfID, then divided between the three departments. DfID&apos;s share of the conflict pool had shrunk to 5% by 2010-11, while the FCO absorbed 60%. Icai highlighted the conflict pool&apos;s weaknesses in two case studies: Pakistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Icai said its work in Pakistan supporting activist groups which campaign against political extremism is relevant and worthwhile but far too small-scale to have a real prospect of countering radical forces. Nonetheless, Icai credited the pool&apos;s efforts to promote unofficial dialogue between MPs in India and Pakistan as contributing to a resumption of official dialogue in 2011 following a breakdown in relations after the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. In DRC, aid has focused on financial and material support to the UN peacekeeping mission (Monusco) on disarming and reintegrating foreign armed groups, reform of the army  particularly payroll management, and a project to improve living conditions of soldiers and their families to reduce abuses of the population by the army. But the prospects of significant conflict prevention gains from the strategy are slim as fighting continues in eastern DRC. &quot;The report finds that the pool has proved effective at identifying and supporting worthwhile conflict prevention initiatives and has delivered some useful results,&quot; said Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary. &quot;It recommends key reforms, many of which are already being addressed with the work to implement the building security overseas strategy.&quot; Positive influence on ADB In a separate report on DfID&apos;s involvement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (pdf), Icai said the UK has a positive influence on ADB strategy, policy and internal reform. However, this is yet to result in ADB achieving its own impact targets. To improve ADB&apos;s delivery of outcomes, DfID needs to influence the bank to improve project management and real-time monitoring. Icai gives DfID&apos;s engagement with the bank a green-amber assessment. DfID has invested $113m (73m) in the ADB and committed to a further $53m, making it a 2% shareholder.",

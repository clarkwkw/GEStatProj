    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Your character has been taken prisoner by the crazed magician Magusar. Fortunately, the skeletal cage he or she has been locked in also contains Librom, a sentient book with angry-looking eyes and a collection of bloodthirsty stories in which you control the magically charged antihero. The third-person action takes place in a series of spectacular arenas, whose detailed backdrops are artworks in themselves, framing battles with monsters that are every bit as rich. They come complete with elaborate backstories and amusingly macabre lore, each steeped in its own version of sacrifice; a theme that runs through every aspect of the game. Not to worry, though, because lost powers can be renewed with lacrima, the seepings of the book&apos;s grotesquely deformed eyes, collected by dabbing one gently with your finger on the touchscreen. A work of unhinged brilliance.",

Can his ideas be applied to the private sector? Has he presented his theory to the heads of Eton and Harrow? Will teachers have to pay for their own anti-depressants or will heads distribute them after morning assembly?Lawrence GloverBootle, Merseyside  If Michael Wilshaw believes that staff morale being at an all-time low is an index of doing something right, then he presumably thinks the same of student morale. This is similar to school bullies claiming their victims are the ones at fault. This approach to education makes me relieved to have retired. Ian RobertsBaildon, West Yorkshire",

    "text": "BioShock Infinite has had something of a troubled genesis, one fraught with delays and a weight of expectation from an audience enraptured by Irrational Games&apos; 2007 original. In many ways, this is the true sequel to BioShock, developed with the careful oversight of creator Ken Levine  and, thankfully, it&apos;s been worth the wait. Playing as Pinkerton detective agent Booker DeWitt, you&apos;re off to the secretive airborne city of Columbia  a roving &quot;perfect society&quot; that&apos;s corrupt below its pleasing veneer  to rescue Elizabeth, possessor of strange powers and the young daughter of the city&apos;s messianic prophet. Shades of the earlier games&apos; Little Sisters, then, but Elizabeth proves to be a far more potent figure. Assorted Vigors grant Booker abilities such as flame-throwing and telekinesis. Combined with Elizabeth&apos;s ability to tear holes in the fabric of space-time to provide health, weapons, and defences, Infinite allows players considerable flexibility in how to escape Columbia, offering a fresh take on the first-person shooter. Where the failure of Randian objectivism was the focus of the first game, Infinite uses its 1912 period setting to deconstruct modern political thought. Though it tears down ideas of misplaced American exceptionalism, the game itself is nothing short of exceptional  a beautifully designed, engaging and thought-provoking effort. ",

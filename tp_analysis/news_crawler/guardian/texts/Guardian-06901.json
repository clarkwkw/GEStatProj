    "text": "The future wears Lycra, or at least it would seem that way as British cycling scales yet new peaks. As you read this, grown men and women are out on the road pretending to be Bradley Wiggins or Mark Cavendish, before spinning home to watch the peloton rattles up the Champs Elyses when the Tour de France reaches its conclusion. Tour de France 2012 takes the obsession a step further, rolling the sport&apos;s tactics and top riders into a first-person, chafing-free zone. Wannabe directeurs sportifs will appreciate the aggregation of minor improvements on this tour simulator from last year&apos;s edition, which was more a desperate attempt to fill a void rather than a sensible use of anyone&apos;s time, and a far cry from the obsessive verisimilitude of its sister release, ProCycling Manager. Rider profiles have improved, you can skip less compelling sections of parkour, and the time trial is now a button-hammering punishment for your thumbs. If the latter feels irksome and unnecessarily retro, it is part of something altogether more challenging, offering a worthwhile andviable tonic for those who feel bereft when La Grand Boucle packs up its barriers for another year.",

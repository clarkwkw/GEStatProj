    "text": "Kicking off today the London Games Festival is bringing a month of gaming action to the capital, beginning with the jam-packed Eurogamer Expo (which is pretty much sold out, but has a few Friday afternoon tickets available).  You can find out all about the huge number of events at the official website, but for now, here are the six things we reckon you should attend, either for fun, or to learn more about game development. If you missed out on Olympic tickets and regretted it for the rest of the summer, don&apos;t make the same mistake again! Apps World When: 2-3 OctoberWhere: Earls Court 2What: This huge smartphone developer event attracts over 5000 industry professionals with a mix of workshop events, talks and parties. For those just interested in the development scene, there&apos;s a free exhibition and developer zone where you can learn more about creating apps and making a living from creating smartphone software.  One Life Left&apos;s Videogame Karaoke When: October 4, 7pmWhere: Walkabout Temple, What: Join the presenters of the award-winning One Life Left radio show for a night of game-related singing and drinking. Everyone can have a go, selecting one of the many songs the team has carefully modified for gaming purposes  so Purple Rain becomes Heavy Rain, Lionel Ritchie&apos;s Hello is Halo, and (my favourite) Blur&apos;s Park Life becomes, yes, Half-Life. The event has been a storming success in Nottingham and San Francisco, now London must its video game karaoke initiation. ExPlay Game Jam When: 5-6 OctoberWhere: The Science MuseumWhat: If you&apos;ve never attempted to test your coding skills at a game jam before, this is the one to go for. Housed at the wonderful Science Museum (with a Bristol alternative at The Pervasive Media Studios) you&apos;ll compete against over 100 other programmers to build a working game within 24 hours. The resulting projects will be shown off to the public at the ExPlay festival in November. Gamer Disco When: 10 October, 19:00Where: The Book Club, 100-106 Leonard StreetWhat: Enjoy a whole bunch of DJs playing electro, hip-hop chip tunes and game soundtracks all night at this super cool Shoreditch venue. I&apos;m hoping for some remixed Rob Hubbard and Martin Galway, but then I&apos;m old; possibly too old to be at a Shoreditch club on a Wednesday night.  Video game art exhibition When: 22-26 October, 08:00-17:30 every dayWhere: City HallWhat: Boris Johnson&apos;s pad is set to host a major exhibition of video game art. Running between 22 and 26 October, the free event will feature rare pieces donated by a huge range of publishers and developers: concept art, storyboards and digital images will all feature. The works will be auctioned off at the close of the exhibition, with the proceeds going to SpecialEffect, a charity specialising in making games accessible to people with disabilities. Among the items on show will be game art produced by well-known developers such as Guerrilla Games (Killzone) and Media Molecule (LittleBigPlanet) as well as major publishers like Konami and Warner Bros. MCM Expo When: 26-28 OctoberWhere: ExcelWhat: A huge celebration of games, comics, SF and fantasy, attracting over 50,000 attendees and plenty of special celebrity guests. As well as the main show floor, there&apos;s a full calendar of fringe events organised by fans, and lots and lots of cos-play.",

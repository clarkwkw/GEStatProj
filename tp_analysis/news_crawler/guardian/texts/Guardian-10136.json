The scots pines of Glen Feshie near Kingussie in the Cairngorm mountain range in the Scottish Highlands. Scientists have pinpointed the Scots pine as the next well-loved British tree species that could fall victim to foreign pathogens. They believe that the expected devastation triggered as ash dieback disease sweeps Britain could soon be followed by a second invasion. Pinus sylvestris is considered to be particularly vulnerable because two major pests that attack it have already established themselves in western Europe: the pine wood nematode, a worm that infects pine trees and causes pine wilt, and the fungus Fusarium circinatum, which causes the disease pitch canker Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/Guardian       A young ash tree infected with ash dieback on a Woodland Trust Site near Framlingham, south-east England. The deadly fungal disease, which causes leaf loss and crown dieback, has already affected up to 90% of ash trees in parts of Denmark and has now been found in the wild in Britain. Ash trees are the third most prevalent tree in Britain, but their contribution to the woodland canopy is such that their loss could mean the end of many animal and plant habitats Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters       Dead foxes are seen placed on a dry stone wall near Fair Head in the Glens of Antrim, northern Ireland November 7, 2012. Foxes that have been culled during the night are left on display for the landowner to view.

Vikars said: 'I buried my sound-isolated camera box in the snow nearby. In my warm hide about 50 metres away, I was ready with the camera's remote release. l used my other camera and a 300mm lens to check the scene. It was extremely difficult to see what was going on at the feeding place even though I had exhausted ISO and exposure values to their absolute maximum to give me at least a slight idea when to trigger the camera. I took many photographs, but often the deer would move too fast or in the wrong direction given the long exposure time' Photograph: Tommy Vikars/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       2012 World Press Photo competition, first prize: Rhino Wars by Brent Stirton South Africa An anti-poaching team guards a northern white rhino, part of a 24-hour watch, at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, 13 July 2011. The park is home to four of the world's remaining eight northern white rhinos, the world's most endangered animal. Despite the fact that rhinoceros horn is illegal worldwide, demand is rising steeply as a newly wealthy Asian middle class is able to afford the prized substance, previously the province of the rich. With rhinoceros horn worth more than gold, the animals are the target of poachers. South Africa alone lost over 400 rhinos to illegal poaching in 2011. It is estimated there are only 16,000 rhinos left in the world, and the animal faces extinction   Photograph: Brent Stirton/Getty Images/NG/2012 World Press Photo       Crocodiles and alligators' snouts are more touch-sensitive than human fingertips, a new study shows. Alligators have 4,000 tiny, raised black spots on their heads, along their jaws, inside their mouths, and between their teeth. Crocodiles have about 9,000. Scientists have known about these bumps called integumentary sensory organs for more than 100 years, but until now their purpose was a mystery Photograph: David Grunfeld/Getty Images       Elephants play at the Maasai Mara game reserve in Kenya Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters       The Brazilian three-banded armadillo, Tolypeutes tricinctus, will be the mascot of the 2014 FIFA World Cup which will take place in Brazil.

Serrano said: 'At a depth of 20 meters, lying face up on the sandy bed of the Sea of Cortez, Baja California, I was constantly forced to change my position since it was impossible to say from which direction the bird would come. With my fisheye lens l also wanted to get as close as possible to the action. Finally, everything fell into place: in my immediate vicinity the cormorant plummeted bullet-like into a shoal of grunts, scattering them in all directions to isolate individual fish' Photograph: Cristobal Serrano/2012 GDT European Wildlife Photographer       A female Bornean orangutan named Aan, rescued from an oil plantation in the Indonesian part of Borneo where she had been roaming for over a month, has survived an operation to remove 32 of the 104 air gun pellets in her body.

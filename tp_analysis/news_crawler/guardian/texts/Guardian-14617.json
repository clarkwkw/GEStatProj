    "text": "A fire at a nuclear power plant triggered a major response by emergency services after smoke was seen billowing into the air. Police and fire crews were called to Hartlepool power station at about 6.30pm on Saturday after a blaze broke out while a turbine was being reactivated. The fire caused smoke to billow from the plant but Cleveland police said it was drifting away from nearby homes. Firefighters extinguished the blaze but remained on site as a precaution. No one was injured. A statement from the force said: &quot;During incidents such as this, there are several procedures that take place including the venting of steam generators. This particular process causes noise, which residents of nearby areas such as Seaton Carew may hear. &quot;There is smoke billowing as a result of the fire, but it is currently heading in a direction that does not cause any implications for members of the public.&quot; EDF Energy, which runs the facility, confirmed a small fire was detected in the turbine hall of unit 2 at Hartlepool power station. A spokesman added: &quot;The fire was quickly brought under control and any residual smouldering extinguished at 7.53pm. &quot;There were no injuries as a result of this incident and there is no threat to the public or staff. &quot;Unit 1 at the power station continues to operate normally.&quot;",

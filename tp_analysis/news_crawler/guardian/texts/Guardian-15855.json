    "text": "Work in the garden this evening was difficult on account of the clouds of gnats that seemed to be ever on the attack. Some old-fashioned folks say that when gnats bite in this tormenting fashion it is a certain sign of rain, but my experience is that in the absence of wind, unless the evening is very cool, you will have these insect pests in abundance at this season. The temperature is very high  probably this will prove to be the hottest day for nearly a year past. The south wall of the house is a mass of yellow roses, and the borders are full of midsummer flowers. In all parts of the country the hay grass is promising a record crop. For miles along the railway as you pass through the Fylde from Preston to Blackpool the fields are covered with a bright yellow carpet of buttercup. The seed grass is rapidly coming on and is in some places being cut already. Should this growing weather continue many hay meadows I have passed through to-day will be fit to cut in a week&apos;s time. This is one of the few places that have not been visited by heavy thunderstorms, but as I write drops are falling, and if there is nothing but a heavy rainstorm the country will be all the better for it, and the dusty roads will be made more comfortable for pedestrians.

    "text": "They&apos;ve gone now  all but the last few stragglers, fighting their way against the chill autumn winds as they begin their epic voyage south to warmer climes. They won&apos;t be back for almost half a year. But what is really amazing is not the fact that house martins make this twice-yearly journey across the face of the globe, but that for most of the time that they are away from our shores we don&apos;t even know where they are. We do know that our house martins  along with the 20 million, and possibly as many as 50 million in the rest of Europe  spend our winter in Africa, mostly south of the equator. But Africa is the world&apos;s second biggest continent, and knowing that they are there doesn&apos;t mean that we can find them. Ornithologists have trapped and ringed close to a third of a million house martins in the century or so since bird ringing began in Britain. And yet of all these, only two have ever been found south of the Sahara: one in Senegal and the other in Nigeria. We believe that the rest of our house martins spread all the way across equatorial Africa, but in such low densities that we hardly ever see them. The contrast between the mystery of the house martin&apos;s existence when away from us, and its familiarity to us when here, is hard to comprehend. Like the house sparrow, we name it after the place where we live. Yet while the average sparrow is content to spend its life within a mile or so of its birthplace, the house martin travels vast distances. I am especially fond of this species as I live in a village, and according to the British Trust for Ornithology so do most of our house martins. I see them as they swoop low above the roofs, and although they do not breed on our home, they do build their cup-shaped nests on several houses in the centre of the village. It has been claimed that house martins bear a resemblance to another charismatic creature: the killer whale. The colour pattern and shape are certainly similar, despite the size difference. And if you are an insect, the sight of a house martin bearing down, beak ready to snap shut, must be pretty terrifying. Most of them are long since gone now, and although a few swallows flew south over my garden in the first week of October, I do not expect to see either of these summer visitors again until the spring. Yet there is always a slim chance that I might: a few years ago my neighbour showed me a photo of a swallow in the field opposite my home, taken on the first day of December. Many years earlier, as I tramped along a shingle beach in Norfolk in a late November gale, I saw two house martins flying low towards me  almost certainly having just crossed the North Sea from Scandinavia.I suspect that this tardy duo didn&apos;t manage to make it as far as Africa. But as I watched the last of our house martins leaving this year, I mouthed a silent prayer that they would be more fortunate. I hope that on a sunny day in April I shall see them again, hunting for insects over my village, amid the deep blue skies of spring.",

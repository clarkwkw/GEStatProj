    "text": "Since entering the games console business, Sony has struggled to find a mascot inherently linked to the brand in the way that Nintendo has Mario and Sega has Sonic. There have been plenty of candidates: Lara Croft and Nathan Drake immediately spring to mind; then there are our friends Ratchet and Clank. This series of platform games, starring animal-like alien mechanic Ratchet and his diminutive robot chum Clank, is still being made today, but to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their bid to become Sony&apos;s signature characters, the company has cobbled together this compilation of adventures from their heyday, the PlayStation 2 era, when the duo wowed critics and consumersalike. Given a new HD polish, the trio of titles included  Ratchet &amp; Clank, Going Commando, and Up Your Arsenal  have all aged well, thanks largely to their energetic spirit and refined level design. The trilogy offers great value for gamers hankering for a nostalgic trip into a stylistically distinct past or anyone yet to give the pair a try.",

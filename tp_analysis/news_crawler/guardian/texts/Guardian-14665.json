    "text": "Ren Yong&apos;s smart new clothes are an instant giveaway: although he is resting in his parents&apos; house in the muddy village of Lijiagou, he is on a brief visit from his new home in the city. Working in Shijiazhuang offers double the local income and infinitely better career prospects, but also, the 22-year-old hopes, better benefits and public services. &quot;Social insurance is very important: you pay a bit of money right now, but feel more secure for the future,&quot; he says. Yet as a migrant, Ren does not have the same right to these benefits as those born in the city. Raised in one of China&apos;s poorest counties, but now enjoying urban life, he has experienced the triumphs and inequities of its social safety net first-hand. In little more than 10 years, the country has constructed a basic welfare system that took the west decades to build, with immediate results. Ren&apos;s neighbours in Chicheng  less than 200km from Beijing  vouch for incomes boosted by new benefits and massive savings on medical bills. But the new generation of leaders steering China through the next decade have no time to enjoy their predecessors&apos; achievements. While coverage has expanded rapidly, provision remains inconsistent, inadequate, inefficient and often riddled with corruption. And paying for even current, meagre levels of support will prove increasingly difficult because China is ageing so rapidly. Last year, its working-age population shrank. Ren and his parents belong to the rural medical insurance scheme that has helped to ensure almost everyone in China has cover, compared with only 13% a decade ago. Minimum income guarantees have been rolled out to the countryside, benefiting more than 50 million residents in impoverished areas such as Chicheng. Ten years ago, just over 200 million people had pensions, mostly in the cities; now, almost 700 million are covered. But Ren has no medical insurance in the city; should he fall ill there, he would have to return home. Though he praises the social insurance scheme that should guarantee him injury, unemployment, pension and other payments, he does not actually benefit from it: his current company, like many in China, has not enrolled him. And more generally, as a migrant, he is not eligible for all the benefits and services those registered as urban citizens enjoy. China&apos;s 12th five-year plan makes it clear that improving the safety net is a priority, not just to reduce inequality and improve well-being  128 million people were living on less than $1 a day in 2011  but also to expand household consumption and improve social stability. But though social spending has soared over the past decade, the Gavekal Dragonomics consultancy points out it is roughly flat this year as a share of both the economy and total expenditure. No one expected Beijing to introduce Scandinavian-style generosity from the cradle to the grave, and Angela Merriam of research firm China Policy says Europe&apos;s debt crisis has increased cost concerns: &quot;My feeling is that China is moving towards a US-style social welfare system,&quot; she says. The focus is increasingly on improving the system rather than simply spending more. Stein Ringen of the University of Oxford and King lun Ngok of the Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou have argued that &quot;there is not one welfare state, but many and radically different ones&quot; (pdf): provision is a patchwork, both geographically and socially fragmented. It is hard to administer, hard to understand and inflexible in a fast-changing and increasingly mobile society. It is also blatantly unfair. In cities, there are different pension systems for civil servants, public services workers, urban employees and urban residents: &quot;The gaps are large and the system is unreasonable,&quot; Yang Lixiong, deputy director of the China Social Security Research Center at Beijing&apos;s Renmin University, says. He points out that while rural dwellers receive around 70 yuan (7.35) a month, urban residents receive between 400 and 500 yuan, and public servants two to three times that. The system is also dogged by excessive overheads, noncompliance by companies, mismanagement and corruption. Recent research by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences suggested that about 80% of eligible households were not receiving the rural minimum income guarantee, and 60% of its recipients did not meet the standard criteria. Experts say creating a better and sustainable welfare system will mean making tough political decisions: forcing state-owned enterprises and the wealthy to pay more, providing stable, long-term funding for local governments, increasing oversight, raising the retirement age and reducing some of the glaring disparities in benefits. All of those are likely to meet serious opposition. But the future of Ren and hundreds of millions more depend on them.",

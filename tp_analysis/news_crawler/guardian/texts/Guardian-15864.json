    "text": "Last time we saw Donkey Kong Country Returns it was in the form of a Wii game rooted firmly in only two dimensions. Its new incarnation comes bolstered by 3D visuals, and a subtle rebalancing of the platformer&apos;s mechanics in favour of less experienced players. Let&apos;s be clear, though: despite the new aesthetic third dimension, the game itself remains a title effectively played on a 2D plane. It is nonetheless a brilliantly designed example of its genre, with a rhythm and flow rather distinct from that seen in the main canon of Mario games. This release includes the original game and the rebalanced version, both of which are relatively challenging but well worth the investment of time needed to unveil each level&apos;s many secrets.",

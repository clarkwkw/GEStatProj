    "text": "This Nasa video (below) shows the remarkable view from the Curiosity rover as it descended to the surface of Mars on Monday. Taken by the Mars Descent Imager, it covers the final minutes until touchdown at four frames per second. The sequence begins while the rover is still attached to its parachute. First, we see the heat shield fall away to the ground ahead of the rover. Out of view, the rover and its descent stage then separate from the capsule back cover and parachute. The descent stage then carries the rover closer to the ground, firing rockets to slow down and keep airborne, and sometimes tilting to keep upright. The rockets throw up the clouds of surface dust which clearly show in the video. As Curiosity is winched down to the surface on cables, one its wheels pops into view at upper left. Touchdown took place just after the end of the video.           The principal investigator for the Mars Descent Imager, Dr Mike Malin, commented that this video will allow scientists to pinpoint the landing site to within a few centimetres. A high- video will eventually be released, but engineers warn it may take weeks for it to be sent back to Earth.",

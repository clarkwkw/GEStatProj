    "text": "Britain is one of the top five research nations in the world, alongside China, Germany, Japan and the US. In fact, our scientists are actually the most productive of the lot. Scientists around the world may talk about British science, but is it a topic of discussion among the people running our country? Previous articles in this series have focused on parliamentarians, leaving out the cogs of a much bigger mechanism altogether:    @adamcommentismgu.com/p/37b33 Another article that ignores the thousands of scientists within the civil service&mdash; Craig Kennedy (@kenjafield) May 5, 2012    Last week, the government&apos;s chief scientific adviser, John Beddington, voiced his support the often-overlooked network of science experts installed across Whitehall. &quot;As an adviser you are responsible for assessing the strength of the evidence, providing independent challenge, and mitigating risks,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The nature of the role means one is often doing the job when your decisions are out of the news, not in them.&quot; So how do civil servants access the research on which to base their advice? Most departmental chief scientists retain a foothold in research, but the thousands of civil servants @kenjafield was talking about do not. How good are they at ensuring they use our world-class research?  First of all, just how many civil servants have a science background? That&apos;s not an easy question to answer. The civil service collects only data that is volunteered by individuals themselves  according to this, out of a total of 444,000 full-time civil servants there are 3,662 civil servants with a science background. But that number may well be an underestimate. But the traditional model of the civil service is to prize transferable skills rather than specific expertise. According to Jill Rutter, programme director at the Institute for Government, &quot;Civil servants are much more focused on responding to things and dealing with things than being expert.&quot; The civil service does however employ thousands of scientific specialists. The science teams at Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) each have more than 90 scientists, not counting people with a science background but not in a science role. These in-house experts might be useful, but they may find it hard to stay as up-to-date as their counterparts in the outside world. &quot;Only the full-time researchers can maintain the cutting-edge knowledge that may be needed,&quot; says Dr Philippa Brice of PHG Foundation, a think-tank that has spent over 10 years encouraging Whitehall and Westminster to entertain the idea of incorporating full genetic analysis into the NHS.  One scientist at DECC said he and his colleagues were &quot;very plugged in&quot; to what researchers are up to in institutes and universities, but Brice thinks this ought to be their only focus. &quot;Civil servants can keep track of  public feeling, politics between scientists and so on. This would help politicians who have no science themselves to learn what the potentials and pitfalls of science really are, and make evidence-informed decisions.&quot; Maybe this is more an issue of evidence than the practice of pure science? Comments to previous Talking science to power articles  from both anonymous posters and former science minister Ian Taylor  have lamented parliamentarians&apos; handling of scientific evidence. One reader argued that &quot;it would make for better governance if there was a much stronger compulsion to develop policy based on evidence&quot;.  This call has been repeated many times over recent years. And now the quango-turned-charity Nesta is building an Alliance for Useful Evidence. The aim is to promote greater use of evidence in social policy, from education to drugs to healthcare. How exactly? The alliance is so new that its manager, Jonathan Breckon, is only three weeks into his job and still writing the strategy. But with 300 members already signed up, he says there&apos;s a &quot;real buzz&quot; about evidence. Breckon&apos;s style will be to engage busy civil servants and politicians in how evidence can work for them. &quot;I don&apos;t want it to be a whinge-fest,&quot; he adds. The idea is to campaign for the importance of evidence through events and publications rather than actually supplying it, a responsibility that remains primarily with researchers. Already, more and more civil servants are partnering with outside scientists to collect evidence and serve it up to policymakers. There&apos;s even a new mechanism for this, called &quot;co-design, co-production and co-delivery&quot;. It sounds like a bit of Whitehall wishful thinking, but the model is actually being put into practice by Living With Environmental Change (LWEC), a partnership created in 2008 by the agencies that fund environmental research and government departments with environmental responsibilities. &quot;LWEC is about getting the evidence and improving the communications channels,&quot; explains Professor Andrew Watkinson, LWEC&apos;s director.  Watkinson also retains a position at the University of East Anglia. &quot;We&apos;re finding out what it is the policy makers need addressing and then engaging in a dialogue with the researchers to find out how to ensure the evidence flows through.&quot; LWEC&apos;s work can be seen reflected in the government&apos;s Natural Environment White Paper, which built on the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, a two-year collaboration based on the LWEC model.  LWEC is still very much an experiment and currently undergoing an evaluation by Sir Brian Bender, a former permanent secretary of the department that became Defra. Bender is due to report in June, and might indicate how the model could benefit other policy areas, such as food or energy. But mechanisms are worthless without people to drive them. Even the supposedly dispassionate world of science relies on the personalities of the individuals trying to connect science and Whitehall. Dr Emily Shuckburgh is one such person. In her day job at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Shuckburgh oversees oceanography research that aims to improve climate change predictions.  In an additional role, she has been working with DECC as a part-time secondee in an attempt to link up the environmental research base with policy. &quot;It&apos;s a nut that people have been trying to crack for some time,&quot; she notes. Shuckburgh is banking on the British Antarctic Survey and DECC confirming her fixed-term secondment as a permanent arrangement, involving a day&apos;s work per week. The way that Shuckburgh can straddle both Whitehall and the research base is critical. DECC&apos;s internal science and evidence team might have strong links to scientists, she says, &quot;but it&apos;s not quite the same as having someone from the science community who lives and breathes it, going back in and being able to describe what the evidence needs are&quot;. The reason this is important is because scientists so often concentrate only on their research, such is the degree of effort and amount of time it demands. More often than not they miss the opportunity for their work to be translated into a form that could be useful to policymakers. &quot;That last link is critical,&quot; says Shuckburgh. Her point is consistent with the controversial requirement that every researcher applying for a publicly funded grant from the government&apos;s 4.6bn budget must state how their work might be used beyond the lab. In fact, the Natural Environment Research Council already maintains a database of how the research it funds helps to shape policy. Shuckburgh wants to investigate how the &quot;last link&quot; could work most effectively, but the idea that researchers ought to consider how their work will be used is not without its critics. Since last week&apos;s protest about how science is funded, a debate among scientists has raged on Twitter and various blogs.  The question is: do we want scientists to conduct research with a planned impact, or let them loose so they might discover things we had never predicted? This is the most political question among scientists right now, and it will be the subject of next week&apos;s article.",

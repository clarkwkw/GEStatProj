    "text": "Following my revelation that George Osborne&apos;s Treasury is seeking to slash the subsidies for onshore wind power - the cheapest form of renewable energy - the House of commons select committee on energy and climate change is to investigate. Conservative MP Tim Yeo, chair of the committee, said: &quot;Government policy on wind power should be based on sound economics and engineering, not political pressure from a small vocal minority  whether that be green campaigners or anti-wind protestors.&quot; Others have identified the key vocal minority more precisely: the backbench Conservative MPs who demanded David Cameron slash the subsidies for onshore turbines. (I wrote about the politics of this previously.) &quot;We will be asking if the chancellor is right to consider cutting onshore wind power subsidies?&quot; said Yeo. An answer from Osborne himself seems unlikely: Yeo said on Tuesday that the committee was &quot;having difficulty getting a Treasury minister to appear and answer questions&quot;. To recap, an agreement to cut onshore wind subsidies by 10%, based on independently commissioned analysis by Decc, was hammered out last autumn by Osborne, Cameron and the then secretary of state for energy and climate change, Chris Huhne. Now, I was told, Osborne wants to renege on this and slash by 25%. &quot;We want to cut through all the hot air talked about wind power and examine whether the economics really add up,&quot; Yeo added. &quot;Wind farms are over forty times less polluting than gas burning power stations - per unit of energy produced - but there are concerns about the costs to consumers. How much these subsidies really add to our electricity bills? Are there cheaper ways to cut carbon emissions from our power stations?&quot; I suspect some of these questions are rhetorical. The subsidies for all renewable energy adds about 20 a year to bills - less than 2%.  Researchers at the London School of Economics proved rather clairvoyant by putting out their answers to these questions on Monday. &quot;A key attraction of onshore wind over other low-carbon forms of electricity generation is cost,&quot; the report concludes. &quot;In terms of levelised cost  an economic measure which takes into account all of the costs of a technology over its lifetime  onshore wind is currently the cheapest renewable technology in the UK.&quot; The report suggests zero-carbon, sustainable wind could be fully competitive with older, polluting conventional sources of energy &quot;as early as 2016&quot;. The LSE team acknowledge that the visual impact of the turbines can be a serious issue, when sited in the wrong places, and adds: &quot;One can think of the extra cost of offshore wind as the premium society is willing to pay to avoid the local environmental cost of onshore wind.&quot; That argument has the great advantage of not being economical with the truth. So what are the chances of George Osborne telling us that putting up home energy bills is an acceptable price to pay for fewer onshore wind turbines?",

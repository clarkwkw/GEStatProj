We would humbly submit that if you&apos;ve read our interview with Marko Ahtisaari, and other Nokia coverage, you know most of this already. But read it and see what else you get. Apple OS &quot;really vulnerable&quot;, claims Kaspersky Lab CTO (UPDATED) &gt;&gt; Computing News  [Kaspersky CTO Nikolay] Grebennikov originally stated that Apple had invited Kaspersky Lab to work with the company on improving its security, but has since issued a clarification. The company has now said that its analysis of OS X was &quot;conducted independently&quot; but that &quot;Apple is open to collaborating with [Kaspersky] regarding new OS X vulnerabilities.&quot;  In Computing&apos;s original interview, Grebennikov was specifically asked three times if Apple had requested Kaspersky Lab&apos;s assistance.   That hissing noise? The deflating sound from all the sites which had written &quot;OMG APPLE GOES TO KASPERSKY FOR VIRUS HELP&quot; stories. Not that Apple isn&apos;t facing a problem. But it&apos;s not going to Kaspersky for the solution. How Pixar almost lost Toy Story 2 to a bad backup &gt;&gt; Tested Simply scary. Hurrah for offsite backups. Microsoft Xbox plays more web video than iPhone, iPad, or Android &gt;&gt; AllThingsD This is great. Knock yourselves out arguing over the interpretation of the pie chart, the mysterious absence of other devices (Wii, PS3?), the non-inclusion of &quot;PC&quot; devices... there&apos;s enough here for days of argument. (It also shows how misleading the phrase &quot;more than&quot; can be.) Sexism-in-tech: how to be an entitled prick &gt;&gt; Tom Morris Think of this as a warmup for the next link. (Read it first though.) Dresscode: Blue tie and male &gt;&gt; Elektronista  So here I am at Dell&apos;s huge and very professional summit with founder Michael Dell, top people from Microsoft and Intel, impressive power points, expensive commercials, matching polyester ties and all that jazz, and then the - by Dell chosen - moderator starts to rejoice the lack of women in the room. &quot;The IT business is one of the last frontiers that manages to keep women out. The quota of women to men in your business is sound and healthy&quot; he says. &quot;What are you actually doing here?&quot; he adds to the few women who are actually present in the room.    This may be more complex than it looks. One commenter says that Mads Christensen, the compere, is a Danish comedian, and that his talk was actually ironic and in effect a reproach to the plethora of guys in the room. Others say that Christensen isn&apos;t - that he&apos;s just a jerk. Can anyone elucidate? (Dell later apologised, but even there commenters are saying it&apos;s overblown and he was being ironic.) The $144,146,165 Button &gt;&gt; notes.unwieldy Conrolling defaults in user interface design can make people very much more wealthy. Scholar: regulating Google results would violate First Amendment &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  The new Google-commissioned paper, written by well-known UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh and attorney Donald Falk, argues that such regulations would be preempted by the First Amendment. Google&apos;s search engine, they write, &quot;uses sophisticated computerized algorithms, but those algorithms themselves inherently incorporate the search engine company engineers&apos; judgments about what material users are likely to find responsive to these queries.&quot;  The authors argue that this selection process is no different, constitutionally speaking, from a newspaper editor selecting wire stories to run, a guidebook deciding which attractions to feature, or a parade organizer choosing which floats to include. The courts have ruled that all of these editorial processes are fully protected by the First Amendment.   True, but misses the point. The FTC&apos;s beef is with Google cross-promoting products such as its Google shopping comparison, or maps, or video, in its search results. When Google doesn&apos;t have a competitor in a space, the other product appears highly in search results. As soon as Google has a product, the rival vanishes from useful search results. Using the monopoly (search) to demote others in a space is, arguably, abuse of monopoly power. Microsoft&apos;s promotion in the 1990s of Internet Explorer on Windows used its engineers&apos; judgements about what material users would find useful in browsing the web, but that didn&apos;t stop it being an abuse of monopoly. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.) The Android income statement &gt;&gt; asymco Horace Dediu:   When playing with the assumptions, it becomes clear that the model is most sensitive to the revenue per device and total devices in use. The profitability is entirely dependent on those figures as variable costs are a percent of sales and fixed costs are limited by talent constraints.  For example, if revenues per device drop to $4.50/yr then the operating margin drops to 38%.  Now we can calculate some of the more interesting figures. For example: o Android OEMs receive $0.76 on average per device per year o Android Operators receive $1.07 on average per device per year (including Play) o Android Developers, as a group, receive $1.94 per device per year (including Play and AdMob) o Google receives a contribution of $2.75 per device per year from Android  Again, these figures are very sensitive to the revenue per device (currently assumed to be $6.50).   Dediu points out in an earlier post that it&apos;s strange how, given the unexpected (even by Google) number of Android devices in use, that the benefit hasn&apos;t shown up clearly in Google&apos;s revenues and profits. Is the company just hiding how good a business Android is, or is it not that good compared to desktop search? Fact-checking Digitimes, the Taiwanese Apple rumour source that keeps crying &apos;wolf!&apos; &gt;&gt; TIME.com Harry McCracken digs into some of the (in some cases literally) fabulous stories emanating from Digitimes. How much should you believe it? You probably already know the answer, but it&apos;s worth seeing how it fares when he goes through a sample of 25 stories from the past two years. How Common Is Your Birthday? &gt;&gt; The Daily Viz US data only, presented as a heatmap, showing the most (and least) common days for a birthday. There&apos;s a strange gap in the data for July 4 and 5 which one has to assume is something to do with national holidays, since a similar one is found around Christmas.

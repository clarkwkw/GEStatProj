    "text": "Earlier this month, the Stroke Association launched the U.K.&apos;s first Action on Stroke Month, an annual campaign that aims &quot;to increase awareness of the impact of stroke and reach out to many more stroke survivors, their families and carers.&quot;  To coincide with the event, the Wellcome Trust has put together a package of materials that are being published throughout the month. It includes films, personal stories from stroke survivors and their relatives, four large infographics, and a series of feature articles, including one by myself about how stroke affects the brain. All of the materials in the Trust&apos;s Focus on Stroke can be found here.",

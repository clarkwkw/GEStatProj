    "text": "Merri Creek flows some 70km from the north down to join the river Yarra at Dights Falls outside Melbourne. And just a short, downhill walk from where we were staying, in the suburb of Thornbury, the steep and rocky channel of the creek, lined with gumtrees, winds between grassy banks. Some of the banks were built as levees after destructive storm floods in 1974. The number and diversity of eucalyptus trees are bewildering  among the better known are the stringybark, with long, fibrous threads of bark, and the ironbark, hard, deeply furrowed, almost black  but it is the river red gum, very frequent along inland waterways, that attracts my eye. I looked at a tall, handsome specimen, its spreading upper limbs smooth ivory, stripped of bark, while lower down the process of bark-shedding in ribbons left an irregular pattern of stripes and patches in shades of grey, brown and red, with a ragged litter around the base. By our local stretch of creek is a wetland recently developed from a man-made flood-break and now nurturing native flora and fauna  part of a campaign to restore the nature corridor formed by Merri Creek after the damage done by more than a century of industrial development along its course. In places the water ripples over rocks and boulders of bluestone, a major building material used in the building of the city. At Northcote, we looked down on boulders and cracked slabs in the riverbed close to the winch tower of a giant quarry developed in the 1860s, and filled, 100 years later, with rubble by a demolition firm. Some disused quarries became refuse tips, and a potential source of pollution. But nowadays, where Merri Creek waters the green spaces of places where it is good to live and breathe, you meet, in the cool of the evening, walkers, cyclists and runners, and fathers and sons out for cricket practice.

    "text": "There has, arguably, never been a better time to be a music fan, with more ways to discover, listen to and share music than ever before, even if disputes about how much the artists make from these services continue to rumble. The big streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer may be familiar, but a host of other apps lie beyond those, from daily suggestions of new tunes to games that create levels based on your songs  via automated DJs, mobile gig tickets and lip-dub videos. 1 | Vevo (Android/iOS) If youre looking for music videos, Vevo should be your first port of call: it has a wide selection, along with exclusive live performances and interviews. The more you use it, the better its recommendations get. 2 | Dice (Android/iOS) Dice is a mobile ticketing app: you buy tickets for concerts within it, and then show your phone to enter on the night. The big draw: no booking fees, and also the promise of smart recommendations for new bands you might love.

Its becoming something more interesting though: an artificial-intelligence DJ that does the mixing (and even chooses the songs, if you want) for you. 4 | BBC Music (Android/iOS) The BBC has so much music across its networks, its easy to miss things youd like. This app aims to avoid that, pulling together live sessions and playlists from presenters and shows, tying in with Spotify, Deezer and YouTube as well. 5 | WhoSampled (Android/iOS) If you want to dig deeper into the music you love, WhoSampled will soak up hours of your time. It scans your iTunes or Spotify library and lets you go back in time via the samples in your songs  as well as remixes and cover versions. 6 | Genius (Android/iOS) The perfect companion for WhoSampled: this app provides annotated lyrics for more than 1.7m songs. So, not just the words, but fellow fans explanations of what they mean and key people and places referenced within them. 7 | Musical.ly (Android/iOS) In 2016, Musical.ly has become a bona-fide app craze, with more than 120 million users. Teenagers in particular have adopted it to create short lip-dub videos, where they dance and mime to their favourite songs. 8 | Combo.fm (iOS) If you like a bit more human in your music recommendations, Combo.fm is excellent. Its team suggests a few songs every day, with text explaining why its been chosen, and the ability to save the ones you like to a Spotify playlist.

It can use songs from your iTunes collection as well as SoundCloud. 11 | White Label  Hip-Hop (Android / iOS) If youre looking for a concentrated burst of new hip-hop tracks, White Label is a great place to start. It mines SoundCloud for the freshest tunes, and serves them up as a playable chart. The same developers Wonder app focuses on indie. 12 | Riff Racer (iOS) This futuristic racing game has a clever twist: it creates its tracks based on songs in your collection, or (if youre a subscriber) Apple Music playlists. This is more than a gimmick: you race in time to the music, to gripping effect. 13 | Mimi Music (Android/iOS) This new app is aimed at anybody who has hearing problems  including loss of frequencies if youve been to one too many gigs without earplugs. It measures your earprint and then tunes music specifically for the way you hear. 14 | Loopimal (iOS) In theory, this app is for children: a creative way to make music with colourful creatures who dance and play loops of audio. It works beautifully but is such fun that parents will find it hard to resist playing when the kids are in bed. 15 | Shazam (Android/iOS/Windows) This app has been downloaded more than a billion times so far, with its core use being to identify a song playing in the real world  whether on a TV soundtrack or in a club. Its newer features include recommendations and the ability to follow artists to see what theyre Shazaming.     Bruce Springsteen in concert last month.

Songkick scans your digital-music service of choice to find out who you like, and then pings you whenever they announce a gig nearby, so that you can buy tickets. 17 | Mixcloud (Android/iOS) The big music-streaming services focus on tracks, albums and playlists but Mixcloud is all about radio-like shows and mixes from DJs and podcasters. Its great for whiling away an hour or two at a time with the tastemaker of your choice. 18 | Lost Music (iOS) Like Combo.fm, Lost Music wants to recommend new music to you, and it works with a selection of influential music blogs and brands to do it. There are plenty of new tracks every day, with Spotify and Apple Music subscribers able to listen in full. 19 | RA Guide (iOS) If youre into dance music, you need RA Guide on your homescreen. Like its parent website, its a comprehensive guide to club nights and DJ sets near you, including tracking your favourite artists. You can buy tickets too. 20 | Lumines Puzzle &amp; Music (Android/iOS) Originally a Sony PSP game in 2005, Lumines has returned as an addictive musical-puzzle game for smartphones and tablets. You have to match coloured blocks to make them disappear, playing to the beat of a range of earworm-worthy dance tracks.",

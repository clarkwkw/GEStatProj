Click here to view After a brief introduction to the tangled lineage of the vampire-hunting Belmont family, you&apos;re launched into the undead-slaying quest of Scots-accented Simon Belmont. As ever, his most frequently used weapon is a whip, which doubles as grappling hook once you&apos;ve unearthed the right power-up, with flasks of burning oil and throwing axes providing backup. There&apos;s a huge map to explore, sections of which prove inaccessible without skills and equipment acquired later in the game, and you can leave notes on the map to remind yourself to pop back later to acquire unclaimed goodies. The drip feed of upgraded skills adds a layer of interest, and also gives you another reason to lay waste to the panoply of monsters that lack the sense to simply run away from you and your holy whip.",

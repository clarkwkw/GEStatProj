    "text": "Official development assistance fell by 4% in real terms last year, following a 2% dip in 2011, but a moderate recovery is expected in 2013, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Paris-based thinktank attributed the drop in aid for the second year in a row to the continuing economic crisis and turmoil in Europe. Since reaching a peak in 2010, ODA has fallen by 6% in real terms. Excluding 2007, which saw the end of exceptional debt relief operations, the fall in 2012 is the largest since 1997. It is also the first time since 1996-97 that aid has fallen in successive years. However, on the basis of the OECD&apos;s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) survey on donors&apos; plans, a moderate recovery in aid levels is expected in 2013. &quot;It is worrying that budgetary duress in our member countries has led to a second successive fall in total aid,&quot; said Angel Gurra, the OECD secretary general, &quot;but I take heart from the fact that, in spite of the crisis, nine countries still managed to increase their aid. As we approach the 2015 deadline for achieving the millennium development goals [MDGs], I hope that the trend in aid away from the poorest countries will be reversed.&quot; In 2012, aid provided by members of the DAC  the club of rich countries  came to $125.7bn (83bn), or 0.29% of their combined gross national income (GNI), well short of the UN target of 0.7%. The 2012 figure was a 4% drop in real terms compared with 2011. There is also a noticeable shift in aid away from the poorest countries and towards middle-income countries, said the OECD. The shift benefited countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. By contrast, aid is likely to stagnate to countries with the largest MDG gaps and poverty levels, including sub-Saharan African countries such as Burundi, Chad, Madagascar, Malawi and Niger. Bilateral aid to sub-Saharan Africa last year fell 7.9% in real terms to $26.2bn compared with 2011. Aid to the whole continent fell by 9.9% to $28.9bn, following exceptional support to some countries in north Africa after the Arab spring in 2011. Bilateral net ODA to the group of least developed countries (LDCs) also fell, by 12.8% in real terms, to about $26bn. Adrian Lovett, Europe executive director at the ONE campaign, said the drop in aid to the LDCs went against the rhetoric of focusing on the needs of the poorest people. &quot;The world&apos;s poorest countries are paying a high price for economic failure in the richest,&quot; he said. &quot;These figures show aid for the least developed countries falling more sharply than aid overall. This does not fit the intent of many major donors  to focus increasingly on countries most in need.&quot; The new DAC chair, Erik Solheim, urged members to live up to their commitments, and mentioned the UK as a country that had done that despite austerity. &quot;I welcome the efforts of those nine DAC members that increased their aid in 2012, and urge others to increase their aid as soon as their budget circumstances allow,&quot; he said. &quot;Maintaining aid is not impossible even in today&apos;s fiscal climate. The UK&apos;s 2013-14 budget increases its aid to 0.7% of national income, which gives hope that we can reverse the falling trend.&quot; In his budget, the chancellor, George Osborne, said Britain would meet the UN target set in 1970 this financial year, although this has not gone down well with members of his own party who believe that the aid budget should not be protected when other departments, including defence, are taking hits. European NGOs criticised governments for trying to balance the books at the expense of poor people. &quot;European leaders are in a scramble to cut what they can, despite the very real damage this could do to the lives and livelihoods of the world&apos;s poorest people,&quot; said Zuzana Sladkova of Concord, the European NGO umbrella group. &quot;Aid has the support of the public in Europe, but support to poor countries is being hit hard by cuts that balance the books on the back of the world&apos;s poor.&quot; NGOs are bailing out of projects as a direct result of aid cuts, said Concord, citing the example of Spain, where aid levels have sunk to their lowest level in 22 years. &quot;This has resulted in Spanish NGOs pulling out of developing countries. 68% of NGOs have had to close some of their aid projects on the ground. This is axing life-saving support to some of the poorest people in need,&quot; said Mercedes Ruiz-Jimenez, director of the Spanish NGO platform Coordinadora. Ben Jackson, chief executive of Bond, the group of British NGOs, said: &quot;A fall of 4% in global aid in 2012 is very disappointing  It&apos;s great news that the UK will reach the 0.7% aid target in 2013, but it is crucial that other EU member states live up to their international commitments. We have only two years left to meet the millennium development goals, and need urgent action to get back on track.&quot; The largest donors, in absolute terms, were the US, the UK, Germany, France and Japan. Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden continued to exceed the UN&apos;s ODA target of 0.7% of GNI.",

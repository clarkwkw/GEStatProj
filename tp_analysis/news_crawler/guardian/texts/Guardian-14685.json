    "text": "Earth Day is 43 years&apos; old today, a milestone marked by one of Google&apos;s annual doodles dedicated to the event. The day of environmental awareness has been marked by a Google doodle for as long as I can remember, from melting polar ice in 2007 (a prophetic nod to the record Arctic melt that year), rocks in 2008, a waterfall and marine life in 2009 to parrots in 2010, pandas in 2011 and animated flowers in 2012. This year&apos;s somewhat pastoral scene of hills, snow-capped mountains and a lake teeming with fish seems to be making a nod to the hydrological cycle, if I&apos;m not over-interpreting the animation. If you click the clouds, for example, it rains, and there appears to be a spot of percolation with water making its way through the soil.  There are a pair of bears in caves and, if you click the hole near the front, a badger pops out is this Google&apos;s pre-emptive strike against the government&apos;s plan to resume its delayed badger cull this summer in a bid to tackle bovine TB? Probably not, but it&apos;s cute nonetheless. Google&apos;s no stranger to environmental efforts, of course. It&apos;s funded a stack of renewable energy projects - though in 2011 it quietly shelved one effort, RE&lt;C, which hoped to see renewable energy become cheaper than coal - and in 2011 the internet giant published its carbon footprint for the first time. Turns out it&apos;s the equivalent of the United Nations, or a little higher than the emissions of Laos. Earth Day, born in the US in 1970, was the creation in large part of Gaylord Nelson, a US senator and Democrat, who died in 2005. It is designed to &quot;[activate] individuals and organizations to strengthen the collective fight against man&apos;s exploitive relationship with the planet.&quot; Denis Hayes, the national coordinator of that first day, said a few years back that he thought the day had achieved many of its aims. &quot;Beyond any doubt,&quot; he said in 2009, &quot;today the basic core values are vastly more &apos;green,&apos; if you will, than they were in the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s.&quot; But with a recent global poll showing that public concern over environmental problems such as climate change and biodiversity loss is its lowest in 20 years, it&apos;s clear that there&apos;s still a need for Earth Day.",

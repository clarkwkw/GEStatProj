    "text": "This week on Science Weekly Camila Ruz, sitting in for Alok Jha, meets the legendary naturalist and filmmaker Sir David Attenborough. Sir David discusses his 60 years making the natural history programmes that have profoundly shaped the way we think about our home planet.  Sir David also shares his views on the thorny subjects of climate change and overpopulation. With the spirit of Halloween in the air, Camila took a trip down to the Museum of London to investigate the murky origins of modern surgery. Curator of osteology Jelena Bekvalac talks us through the museum&apos;s new exhibition Doctors, Dissection and Resurrection Men. Finally, Camila was joined in the studio by Nicky Clayton, professor of comparative cognition at the University of Cambridge and the artist Clive Wilkins. Nicky and Clive are collaborating on a series of talks exploring the links between scientific and artistic practice, the first of which took place on Friday at the Royal Institution in London.  Camila discusses Nicky&apos;s work with birds and why she believes that evidence of an ability to imagine a future is changing how we think about other animals.

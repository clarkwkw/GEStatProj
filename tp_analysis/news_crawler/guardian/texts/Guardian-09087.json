    "headline": "Will Barack Obama or Mitt Romney be better for US science?", 
    "text": "The past couple of weeks have been cause for a dual celebration in the biochemistry and molecular biology lab that I head at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. For one, a postdoctoral fellow who has been working with me for the past three years has received an assistant professor faculty position  no small feat in these troubled times. And if that wasn&apos;t sufficient cause for celebration, I recently received notification of the renewal of one of my major sources of research funding for the next four years  a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). I gazed  shocked and awed  as amazement turned to relief, which morphed into a wondrous spurt of freedom and imagination as I realised that I will now be able to concentrate on doing science  rather than spending all of my time proposing it. However, my own good fortune notwithstanding, these days many scientists in the US are walking around with their heads lowered, muttering glaze-eyed and unfocused, openly pondering retirement and the end of the current wakeful nightmare. Most US universities use a system by which principal investigators receive a portion of their salaries from the institute. This magic number is often 75% in state universities  the supposed rationale being that the researcher doesn&apos;t teach during the summer, so if he/she wants to receive compensation, it should be from research grants.  Some of the private institutions have even less of their scientists&apos; salaries covered, dipping towards 50, 25 10 or even 0% in some cases. For those who think that tenured professors have it easy, please remember that tenure isn&apos;t very helpful if one isn&apos;t receiving a salary.     NIH funding in real terms since 1998. NIH Council of Councils.    As I&apos;ve hinted above, grants from the NIH are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. The National Cancer Institute, one of the many institutes belonging to the NIH, had a payline recently of 6%  meaning that only grants ranked in the top 6% were assured funding. This means that of 20 grants being reviewed, roughly one would be funded. The others will have to manage without research dollars, or money for their salaries. The primary culprit for this situation is the NIH budget, coming in at about $32bn. Essentially, although the Clinton administration facilitated the doubling of the NIH budget just over 10 years ago, in terms of real buying power the budget has been flat for quite a few years (see graph). We have a burgeoning number of scientists, and universities are increasingly anxious to improve and enhance their scientific reputations. This makes for a lot more competition over the same wedge of pie.  The NIH is reportedly finding it harder to recruit scientists for peer review of these grants. After all, it&apos;s depressing to try to distinguish between the merits of grants when only 1/20 are funded! How can a reviewer distinguish between a 6th and 8th percentile ranked grant? Traditionally, the NIH and science funding have been supported by both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, and by both arms of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate. But with a $900bn deficit looming for 2013, and calls for containing the deficit with cuts to government and government spending, predictions are that NIH will be lucky to get off with a small cut of several percent in the upcoming budget. This does not bode well for science. Neither candidate has (predictably) made science policy a major discussion point in his presidential campaign. However, pressed by scientists to answer 14 key questions ranging from their views on investing in science and basic research to climate change, both candidates submitted written answers which can be compared at science debate. Admittedly, both candidates come out in support of investing in science and basic science, although not surprisingly in extremely vague terms. Barack Obama specifically notes on a number of occasions the importance of public (and private) funded basic research and development. He notes the goal of investing ~3% of the GDP in research, and comments that he wants to double funding to key scientific agencies.  Although no time frame is given (nor are the specific agencies identified), Obama has pledged to invest heavily in science education, particularly to enhance the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. He has already begun to do so in the current term. In addition, Obama points to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that he initiated in 2009 as part of the plan to inject capital into the American economy. Huge amounts of money flowed temporarily into the NIH  and although as a recipient of these funds I can&apos;t complain, as this clearly advanced my own research  many scientists have been critical of using such large amounts of money for short-term goals. Mitt Romney, while vaguely endorsing government-supported research and investment in it, seems to shy away from voicing too much support for such public research, and perhaps predictably emphasises the private sector. In comparing his answers to the 14 questions with those of Obama, Romney is less focused on presenting actual plans of what he will do, if elected, and appears more concerned with lashing out at those of his opponent. Romney&apos;s answers often are a rambling and rather diffused attack on the Obama administration&apos;s health care reform (which mandates that every American hold health insurance), and provide minimal substance on actual science policy. Stem cell research was not among the questions presented to the two candidates. However, upon assuming office in 2008, Obama did not take long to ease the restrictions on the use of federal research dollars for studies involving embryonic stem cells (put in place by his Republican predecessor, George W Bush). He has also approved the use of a wider variety of stem cells. Romney has said little about stem cells, but the antagonistic policy of his party is well noted. Given the track record of Obama in supporting education and science (despite difficult economic times), I have little doubt that he will do a better job in promoting science in this country. Knowing that his world view on other issues is closer to my own than that of Romney makes it a simple choice for me on election day  or as we say in the US, &quot;a no-brainer&quot;.",

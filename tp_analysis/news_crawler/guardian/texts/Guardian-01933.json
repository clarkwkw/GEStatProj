    "headline": "Global development podcast: focus on the fair trade movement", 
    "text": "Since the launch of the first Fairtrade label 25 years ago, the UK market has doubled every two years. Now close to 20% of all bananas and coffee sold in the UK bear the label. Once a small, grassroots movement, today fair trade seems fully mainstream.  But what difference has fair trade made? Does it go far enough? Is the movement still relevant? And where does fair trade need to go next? To discuss these issues, John Vidal, the Guardian&apos;s environment editor, is joined in the studio by Harriet Lamb, executive director of the Fairtrade Foundation, David Croft, director of food technology at Waitrose, and Felicity Lawrence, the Guardian&apos;s special correspondent on food.  We also hear from Steve Muchiri, head of the East African federation of farmers, and from readers who took part in the talk point on our website.",

    "text": "&quot;Why flash when you can flutter,&quot; it says on the box. Why indeed? I don&apos;t actually own a car myself, which leaves me with two options for my Lashes4cars: to attach them on the brand new Fiesta I&apos;m currently test-driving for my famous motoring column in Guardian Weekend magazine; or to put them on my girlfriend&apos;s car. I&apos;m not sure how the Ford press office would react if one of their cars came back with headlamp lashes. Plus my girlfriend is away for the weekend. I take the easy option. It&apos;s an old Polo. Well, let&apos;s see if we can&apos;t tart her up a bit for the new year. The lashes are a little wide, but they trim down easily with a sharp pair of scissors. When my own eyebrows get a bit bushy, this car&apos;s owner takes the scissors to me; now this feels a little bit like revenge. Ha. &quot;Fun and easy to install,&quot; it also says on the box. And they are. I then curl them using the curling tool provided (a piece of wooden dowelling), for added cuteness, and a woman walking past says I should be a stylist. Good, now they&apos;re curled, I can see my lashes above the bonnet as I drive along. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m treated any differently on the road. No one lets me in or out; chivalry appears to be well and truly dead in north-west London. No wolf-whistles either. I don&apos;t know, you make an effort, and for what? In Homebase carpark, a little boy notices, and points. His dad gives me a look that&apos;s about 25% amusement, 75% pity. To be honest, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m really in the right kind of car for these. Something cute, such as a Fiat 500, would be perfect. Or a car with pop-up headlights, such as a first-generation Mazda MX-5. Then I really could flutter. But in this, I&apos;m really just mutton dressed as lamb. It&apos;s also possible I&apos;m not quite the right kind of driver. I&apos;m thinking  you know  gender, age, that kind of thing. Will I have to live with them any longer, though? Bad news I&apos;m afraid: my girlfriend, on her return, loves them.",

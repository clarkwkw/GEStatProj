    "text": "It is an intriguing headline on the website of Cherwell, Oxford&apos;s 92-year-old student newspaper  A guide to dating posh girls: Article removed. Helpfully, Cherwell&apos;s younger rival The Oxford Student, no doubt in the public interest, runs the article in full. The removed article was meant to be a light hearted six-point guide for working class boys who might be missing their whippets and want to date a &quot;posh&quot; woman. It did not go down well, with cries of &quot;misogyny&quot; and &quot;stereotyping&quot;. A note from Cherwell&apos;s editors says: &quot;We have decided to remove the article that previously occupied this page. However, this is not a response to the accusations of plagiarism or misogyny. In our view this piece was attempting to satirise the misogynistic (and, indeed, misandrist) &apos;how to &apos; dating guides that pervade the mainstream media. However, this tone was perhaps not conveyed as well as it should have been, and if it caused any offence then we are very sorry.&quot; The article by Tom Beardsworth included advice on posh girls&apos; parents, friends, politics, travel, sex and getting dumped. On travel, it advises that the furthest north she will have gone is LMH (Lady Margaret Hall). &quot;If she does brave it and travels north to see you, be sensitive. As she disembarks the train, refrain from mocking her attire (wellingtons and a ski jacket  &apos;but I thought it&apos;d be freezing&apos;) and instead congratulate her on having made it thus far. When driving her back to your place, it&apos;s a good idea to make a detour past the local Waitrose. This will settle her down considerably.&quot; On sex, the author reveals: &quot;She&apos;ll have had a lot of it, way more than you. Do not believe any assertions to the contrary, she is massaging your fragile ego. Posh Girls lose their virginity at 15, often to the same floppy-haired bloke (remember, they share everything).&quot; If Beardsworth, the paper&apos;s comment editor, is upset at events he can at least be buoyed by the editors&apos; note: &quot;The removal of the piece is no reflection of our views about its author.&quot; Whatever they are.",

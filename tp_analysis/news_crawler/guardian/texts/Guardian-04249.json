    "text": "Prior to becoming secretary general of the Arts Council, Sir Roy Shaw led the Adult Education Department at the University of Keele (Simon Hoggart&apos;s week, 19 May). In 1969, Prof Shaw (as he was then) promulgated to a class of student health visitors (of which I was one) lessons from The Uses of Literacy  Richard Hoggart&apos;s great exposition of the betrayal of the intentions of the 1870 Education Act, and subsequent devaluation of the intellectual capacity of working-class readers of the popular press. Shaw&apos;s teaching on Hoggart&apos;s analysis of the ease with which the media may influence people&apos;s attitudes left an indelible impression on someone who had left school after O-levels and simply pursued what was then nurse &quot;training&quot;. It was probably this, with other experiences on that remarkable course, that convinced me of the need to educate nurses in higher education settings. I have often wondered during the recent phone-hacking debacle why Hoggart&apos;s seminal work has not been revisited.Jane RobinsonEmeritus professor of nursing, Universityof Nottingham  At the Arts Council in the 1970s I worked with both Roy Shaw and Richard Hoggart. Though authoritarian and often prickly, both men articulated and fought for crucially important cultural values in the face of creeping neoliberalism. Hoggart&apos;s Pilkington report, published 50 years ago, remains a vital testament to the importance of the public service ethic in broadcasting. From the perspective of 2012, both Hoggart and Shaw can be seen as proverbial moral giants when compared with current ministerial pygmies like J Hunt and E Vaizey.

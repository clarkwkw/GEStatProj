    "text": "Lara Croft is back. The video game icon is returning on 5 March with a much-anticipated reboot of the Tomb Raider series. The new game, produced by long-time developer Crystal Dynamics, takes us back to the origins of the character, with a young Lara washed up on a remote island where the reception is far from friendly. Much-anticipated and already controversial, this will be a key release for 2013. To celebrate, Square Enix has arranged a special event at Bafta on Tuesday 12 February, where key members of the development team will talk about the process of re-inventing the series for current consoles. In part one of the evening, Darrell Gallagher the studio head of Crystal Dynamics will get together with other senior members of the team to discuss the technical challenges of reinventing Tomb Raider. They&apos;ll demo sections of the game and provide insight into the creative process. In the second part, I&apos;ll be talking to writer Rhianna Pratchett about her role in crafting the story behind this intriguing prequel. There will also be an opportunity for audience members to ask their own questions. Tickets are available at the Bafta site for 5 each. However, we have 20 free pairs to give away to Guardian readers. To stand a chance of claiming them, you&apos;ll need to go here and enter the promo code &apos;keith&apos;. You&apos;ll then need to select either 1 or 2 tickets (please only select two if you definitely have someone to go with!). Be quick!  The Making of Tomb Raider is taking place at Bafta&apos;s Princess Anne Theatre at 7pm on 12 February. The ticketing system is arranged and organised by Bafta, not the Guardian.",

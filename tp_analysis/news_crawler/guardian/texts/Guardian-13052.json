    "text": "All universities with international strategies publish a variety of lofty aims and ambitions: UCL has stated that it wants to be no less than &apos;London&apos;s Global University&apos;.  To set itself apart from others competing in the international arena, UCL has taken a unique approach to satellite campuses: it focuses solely on postgraduate education in niche disciplines that are geographically relevant to the region in question as well as being globally important to us all.  In Australia, for example, UCL is training the next generation of energy and resources leaders, and has established an international energy policy institute and an offshoot of its space science laboratory. In Kazakhstan, UCL was the first university to commit to mentoring Nazarbayev university as it embarked on pioneering a completely new approach to higher education in the country. And in Qatar, UCL aims to position its campus as the centre of excellence in museum practice in the Gulf.  Fair and ethical conduct in its international activities are also set out in the strategy, and in the UK, UCL is committed to extending its partnership with the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics by professionally and financially supporting more international experts who have sought refuge here, as well as using its expertise to lobby the UK government on immigration issues.  It aims to shape UK policy with another initiative too: by introducing a foreign language requirement for all UK applicants - with support available for those without prior knowledge - it may be that education ministers and school leaders will take note, and begin to prioritise language learning so that the pupils of today stand a chance of being able to study and work internationally in a way that many of their overseas counterparts already do with such evident aplomb.",

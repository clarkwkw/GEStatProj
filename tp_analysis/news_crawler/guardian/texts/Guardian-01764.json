    "text": "Set in a futuristic Tokyo, where robots walk among us and have no idea they&apos;re not human, ostensibly Binary Domain is so far, so Blade Runner, but what follows is a third-person, squad-based shooter, more immediately reminiscent of Gears of War or Mass Effect. The ability to bark headset commands at your team-mates serves as good preparation for next month&apos;s Mass Effect 3, which will offer the same feature to owners of Xbox 360&apos;s Kinect. Heading up a multinational undercover squad sent in to Tokyo to find and stop the creator of these humanised robots, players control Dan Marshall, a stereotypically gung-ho US agent. Any suspicion that you&apos;re playing a western-developed game is dispelled as soon as you enter the menu screens, finding an RPG-like structure of upgrades and stat-boosting skills for you and your team that betray the game&apos;s Japanese origin, but it makes for a solid shooter with an intriguing story, despite featuring some cringeworthy national stereotypes that the industry should long since have evolved away from.",

So yes, belt tightening needs to be faster and more effective. Luckily analysts have assigned emission weights to allmanner of products and services, feeding in embodied energy and water data from complex supply chains and probable pollution and distilling this into online calculators. First, use acarbon calculator  footprint.wwf.org.uk and resurgence.org/carbon calculator are my favourites for working out personal emissions. Then set a goal. If you have an average footprint of 10 tonnes, chop it by at least 4% every year (2tonnes per person is the sustainable global per capita footprint). Where are your weak spots? Do you make too many solo car journeys? Carpooling.co.uk utilises a real-time timetable of journeys on social media sites to fill spaces in cars. Or perhaps you have too much of a passion for fashion (this can be unexpectedly high impact)  in April, Christian Aid will launch a catwalk calculator to tabulate wardrobe emissions. Many websites encourage you to &quot;offset&quot; your emissions, paying indirectly for acarbon-saving project you can&apos;t monitor. But instead take apractical approach  for instance, composting most of your waste food will save 600lb of CO2 equivalent. Nearly 50% of mobile-phone users have a smart phone, and green apps are useful for day-to-day monitoring. Some I&apos;ve downloaded or heard good things about are Ecorio, which tracks journeys as you&apos;re on them; Boskoi, which maps edible crops for foragers; Get Growing, which tells you how to save money by growing food, and PowerTutor, which instructs you on how to stop wasting battery life on appliances. Given that half of UK emissions are caused by energy use in housing and for personal transport, apps such as AlertMe and PassivSystems that link up with your home energy monitor or smart meter to bring you real-time information could yield big results. The thorny issues of the impact of consumer electronics  blood mining in the Congo for minerals for phones, labour violations and planned obsolescence  are explored in the app Phone Story, but Apple removed it from the App Store, saying it &quot;violated developer guidelines&quot;. It seems there is not an app for everything.

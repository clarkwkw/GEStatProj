    "text": "Last week, new figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggested that 2011 marked the first reduction in aid for 15 years. Few countries are likely to reach 0.7% in the present economic context. Does that matter? The 0.7% target is an important symbol, but it can obscure the focus on what&apos;s really important, which is not the proportion of donor income given in aid, but the proportion of the recipient economy depending on it. High levels of aid, while sometimes necessary in the short term, are increasingly viewed as antithetical to development in the longer term. While it has always been acknowledged that aid should eventually work itself out of a job, that objective is being voiced more frequently as more and more countries express their desire for a gradual reduction in aid levels in the medium term, rather than just over the long haul. When even the president of Liberia, one of the poorest countries in the world, says she wants to see her country free of aid dependence in a decade, a significant shift is clearly taking place. Last month, we published a report arguing it is time to turn aid measurement on its head. The report proposes a new classification of countries according to their aid receipts. The most familiar country grouping is the World Bank income categorisation on the basis of per capita GNI: high income countries (HICs), middle income (MICs) and low income (LICs). This categorisation helps track countries in their economic growth path. But categorisation by aid receipt may help policymakers in both donor and recipient countries monitor progress on this other increasingly important variable  aid as a proportion of the economy. No such classification yet exists. We suggest classifying recipient economies in four categories depending on their level of aid (high-, middle-, low- and very low-aid countries). High-aid countries (HACs) rely on aid for more than 10% of their GNI, while very low-aid countries (VLACs) receive less than 1% of their GNI in aid. The other obvious option would have been to look at aid as a proportion of government expenditure, as in ActionAid&apos;s Real Aid 3 report. However, in some countries significant amounts of aid are spent outside government systems, and we wanted to know the role aid plays in the economy overall, not just in the government budget.      The results are interesting. The number of HACs decreased from 48 to 37 between 1990 and 2009, while LACs and VLACs rose from 40 to 54. This chimes with general opinion about a move away from aid dependency. However, when we split this 20-year period into decades, an interesting picture emerges that appears to contrast with the conventional wisdom. In the 1990s, 48 countries, almost half those with data, moved down at least one band, becoming less aid dependent, while only three moved up (at least) one band. Contrastingly, in the 00s more countries moved up in the classifications (20) than down (only 14), implying a general pattern of increasing aid-to-GNI ratios. In the 00s, the number of HACs actually increased while the number of LACs/VLACs fell from 47 to 42.",

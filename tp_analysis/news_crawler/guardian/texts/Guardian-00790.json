    "text": "   Observer Ethical awards 2012 judge Deborah Meaden    Deborah Meaden started her business career with very little capital launching her own glass and ceramics import company straight out of Business College. Deborah then set up one of the first &apos;Stefanel&apos; fashion franchises to appear in the UK. With several successful businesses in the leisure and retail sector under her belt, she became managing director of Weststar Holidays, acquired the major shareholding in a management buyout and later sold the company in a deal worth 33 million whilst retaining a 23% stake. She sold her remaining stake when the business was sold for 83 million in August 2007. In 2009, accepting a role as an Ambassador for the WWF, the world&apos;s leading environmental organization, Deborah actively supports environmental charities and initiatives. Chair of Childline Child&apos;s Voice Appeal South West, Deborah also sits on the Board of the Roundhouse, the North London arts centre which hosts world-class performances and provides creative projects for up to 6,000 13-25 year-olds from all backgrounds. Deborah joined the panel of investors for series three of the BBC2 program &apos;Dragons&apos; Den&apos; and has since invested in a number of businesses, ranging from Market Research to online Antiques valuations. Most recently she stepped in to acquire Fox Brothers, a Historic Textile firm based in the South West which was on the verge of closure.",

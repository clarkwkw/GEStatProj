    "text": "To use the word &quot;deportation&quot; regarding the consequences surrounding the loss of London Metropolitan University&apos;s sponsor licence (Editorial, 1 September), instead of the more appropriate &quot;removal&quot;, is wrong and unhelpful. Since 2000, a deportation order is issued in circumstances where it would be deemed in the public good or where the court recommends such action following conviction of an offence punishable with imprisonment. It therefore has much more serious consequences for the deportee, and such casual use of the terms is liable to cause panic among international students already in the UK as well as send out the wrong message to anyone considering the UK as a destination for study.Kay BainsHead of UK immigration, Mazars LLP  The UK Border Agency is hiding the scale of its failures behind sensational headlines. Damian Green is trying to create an illusion that he is tough on immigration by treating legal immigrants like illegal immigrants, and doing nothing about illegal immigration. By revoking the licence of the LMU he is punishing legitimate students, while bogus students will no doubt disappear and join the backlog of 150,000 cases reported earlier this year. The estimated cost of a forced removal is 11,000 per migrant. With an estimated 150,000 individuals requiring removal, this will cost the UKBA 1.65bn  much more than the entire UKBA budget. The processing times for visa renewals have increased steadily in recent months, and the UKBA is now taking almost six months to process postal applications from within the UK. The Border Agency needs more realistic targets, and should be more honest about its capacity. It is losing credibility with its current strategy.J van ZylLondon  I am writing to raise my displeasure regarding the new UKBA rule forcing us legitimate international students to sign in twice a week, every week. I do understand that this is not the university&apos;s decision, but due to current UK immigration policies. However, to require students to sign in twice a week as if we are dangerous convicts is ridiculous. A person on the UK sex offenders register needs to register with the local police only once a year; they are not required to show up twice a week every week, and sign in their &quot;attendance&quot; while being &quot;witnessed&quot; by a member of staff. It seems the current UK government views international students as worse than convicted paedophiles. As UKBA itself has pointed out, only 2% of international students are potentially non-compliant (ie possible fraudulent cases). Disrupting 405,000 legitimate students twice a week, every week, to weed out 2% of potential fraud cases, is in my opinion a very unwise decision. Even if this move removes the 2% of fraudulent students, the government&apos;s inability to restrict EU migration means net immigration is unlikely to fall significantly. As its only other option is to &quot;squeeze non-EU migration as hard as it can&quot;, in the words of the New Statesman&apos;s George Eaton, that means turning away thousands of potential international students while being disruptive to current ones. I urge all UK universities to work together and oppose this move.Mohd OzemanMedicine student, Newcastle University",

For the last decade, Her Majesty&apos;s chief inspector of schools&apos; annual reports have commented on the steady improvement in the quality of initial teacher training. The 2010/11 annual report said that, following Ofsted&apos;s three-year inspection programme of all ITT providers, most providers were judged to be good or outstanding. Importantly, the report stated that &quot;there is more outstanding provision in primary and secondary partnerships led by higher education institutions than in school-centred partnerships or employment-based routes&quot;. How can it be that a year later, after inspections of 21 of around 200 providers, only four of which were higher education institutions, Sir Michael judges that this trend has been reversed?Rhona Seviour and Norman BlackettFormer Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectors (Ofsted)",

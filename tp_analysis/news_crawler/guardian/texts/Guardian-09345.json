    "text": "The assassin Corvo crouches on the rafters watching the scene play out in the room below. Two men, one target and a world of possibilities. A crossbow bolt from above, a blade to the throat or something more subtle? After all, it&apos;s not just about the kill. There&apos;s the exit strategy to consider. Dishonored is a game about decision-making. How to reach the target? How to eliminate the target? How to escape? Arkane Studios has evolved its first-person swords-and-sorcery formula last seen in Dark Messiah of Might and Magic and crafted a masterpiece in gaming freedom. While a twisting revenge narrative and rich steampunk aesthetic provide a strong backbone to the game, it&apos;s the sandbox nature of the assassinations that proves most intoxicating. Combining stealth melee action with supernatural powers, such as teleportation and time dilation, the player has a powerful, varied toolbox at their disposal. Experimenting to find the most elegant solution to the current problem is hugely rewarding and, cleverly, Arkane has ensured that choice does not come without consequence. Corvo&apos;s actions will echo throughout the city of Dunwall and eventually determine the outcome of the storyline itself. The message: choose wisely.",

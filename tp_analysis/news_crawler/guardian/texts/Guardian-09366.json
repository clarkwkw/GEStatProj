    "text": "This week&apos;s show is dedicated to the Nobels. Alok Jha is joined in the studio by Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample and science writer Ewen Callaway from Nature to discuss the science behind this year&apos;s prizes.  Alok speaks to the only British winner this year Sir John Gurdon, whose work demonstrating that adult cells contain the complete complement of genes needed to make an organism led to his sharing the Nobel for physiology or medicine with Japan&apos;s Shinya Yamanaka.  We&apos;ve also got reaction from the British physicist Sir Peter Knight of Imperial College London to this year&apos;s physics prize announcement, and from David Phillips, past president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, to the chemistry prize.

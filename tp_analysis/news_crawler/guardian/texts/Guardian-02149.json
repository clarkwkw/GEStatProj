    "text": "It has launched Obama&apos;s re-election campaign, hosted powerful protest blogs and propelled hip young fashionistas and artists to fame and fortune. Blogging platform Tumblr  created by 25-year-old David Karp five years ago, and now valued at close to 500m  could be called Facebook&apos;s quietly prodigious cousin. Less showy, less of a brand and less well-known than its peers but quietly, doggedly keeping pace with them all: Tumblr now garners around 14bn page views a month, more than Wikipedia and more, even, than Twitter. A Tumblr page is a blank canvas. A post can be a picture, a song, a link, a video. Many of the most successful never post prose. The essence of a Tumblr blog, or &quot;tumblelog&quot;, is freedom for self-expression. A great Tumblr post is reblogged again and again; it tumbles across continents and generations. No surprise then that tumblr isa new proving ground for aspiring writers, artists and comedians. Most comic content on Tumblr is in picture or video form. Clips and snaps of captioned cats and clothed dogs abound, as do photoshopped images and the latest instalments of ever-evolving online memes. The best make it on to the site&apos;s &quot;LOL&quot; feed, selected by Tumblr&apos;s 25-strong panel of &quot;LOL&quot; editors. All the editors are bloggers, and around half work as comedians or comedy writers. Some have hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers. For most users, Tumblr is an end in itself. Many funny tumblelogs  Garfield without Garfield, People Who, Hungover Owls  have become books and many tumbleloggers have gone on to become writers for TV. But most maintain their presence on Tumblr because it connects them directly with their audience. For the comedian, Tumblr, like Twitter, provides fast, quantifiable feedback. The number of times a post is liked or reblogged tells the poster precisely how funny they&apos;ve just been. It&apos;s like being on stage as a standup  but with a 24-hour global audience. Like standups, some tumblelogs play to silence, some find a cult audience and the best are seen by millions: the digital equivalent of an arena tour. The arena-fillers tend to riff on a simple theme: why does Nick Clegg look sad? How do gullible conservatives react to The Onion? What might this cat be saying? Any list that purports to collect &quot;the funniest&quot; anything will amuse and enrage in equal measure. Lovers of omitted contenders, and haters of those included, will howl in indignation. Apologies in advance. Here, nonetheless, is a pick of 10 of the funniest. Notes to My Future Husband This one might be a little divisive. Notes To My Future Husband tends to provoke howls of recognition from women but  speaking from personal experience  can just as often induce in men a short and embarrassing guilty silence. Not just a place to come and laugh then  also a place for serially bad boyfriends to come and learn something. By category: &quot;GIRLFRIENDS  Treat mine well. They know more about you than you can possibly imagine.&quot; &quot;BACON  Bring home the bacon. Literally. I love bacon. That shit is delicious.&quot; People Who  A guide to the worst people in the world as identified by their actions. This website may be the most important and comprehensive manual of contemporary manners and morality we have. If you manage to read to the end without once thinking &quot;I&apos;m one of those people&quot; then odds are you&apos;re doing OK at life. At the very least, don&apos;t be one of the people &quot;who sit at library computers for hours but never seem to leave Facebook&quot;, &quot;repeatedly shout out the same incorrect word during Pictionary&quot;, or, worst of all, &quot;start the standing ovation&quot;. I Love Charts  This combines the plain hilarious with the simply fascinating. Taking entries from all over the internet and beyond, an ILC post can be anything from a 19th-century pie chart to a hand-drawn Venn diagram, and will almost always raise either a laugh or an eyebrow. For people who see the funny in abar chart titled &quot;Frequency of Lying&quot; that spikes at &quot;I have read and agreed to the Terms of Service,&quot; or a colour-coded map of the US titled: &quot;Classification of young American females according to Brian Wilson&quot;. Literally Unbelievable OK, so it&apos;s not strictly a Tumblr. Literally Unbelievable chronicles the po-faced responses of gullible Facebook users to articles from satirical newspaper the Onion, providing both a dose of funny and a feeling of superiority. One classic, from a user responding to an article titled &quot;Brain-Dead Teen, Only Capable Of Rolling Eyes And Texting, To Be Euthanized&quot;: &quot;You need to contact your congressman and tell him to put a stop to this. Why isn&apos;t the media covering this?&quot; We can only hope the congressman contacted took it as seriously. Clients From Hell  This one&apos;s strictly for the computer-literate. If you know your PDFs from your JPEGs, it&apos;s a riot. If you don&apos;t, you&apos;re likely to end up cringing in self-recognition. It collects email, phone and text exchanges between freelancers and their dim-witted clients, with most of the humour centring around the misguided requests of the digitally challenged. Case in point: &quot;I&apos;ve decided on the photos that I would like you to use on the website. They are attached to this email. Please send them back when you&apos;re finished as they are my only copies. Thanks!&quot; Nick Clegg Looking Sad Downhearted deputy PM Nick Clegg may be the defining image ofthe coalition but what really makes this Tumblr is its captions. Each post is a miniature masterclass in observational comedy. Favourites include: &quot;Nick Clegg pressed &apos;300&apos; instead of &apos;30&apos; at the cash machine and now he has to carry loads of money around,&quot; and &quot;Nick Clegg said something stupid as a joke, but then someone pointed out how stupid it was as though it wasn&apos;t a joke, and now everyone thinks he&apos;s stupid and it&apos;s too late to say it was a joke all along.&quot; Animals Doing People Things This one&apos;s for the non-readers. Withno captions or speech bubbles on the images,this self-explanatory blog offers laughs at a glance. Just don&apos;t be surprised to wake from a half-hour trance having clicked through every one of its 42 pages. Typical posts include a miniature schnauzer at a desk, ahusky pup in glasses peering over a well-pawed novel and a crab with a cigarette. Oh, and so many waving bears that you will begin to wonder whether they are actually waving toeachother. Hungover Owls Journalist J Patrick Brown struck gold combining the things we say when we&apos;re hungover with, well, owls. It turns out that when an owl squints, stares, hunches or just closes its eyes it bears a striking resemblance to a drinker on the morning after the night before. The crude and sweary captions should be achingly familiar to anyone who has ever woken up with  as Withnail puts it  a bastard behind the eyes. Classic line: &quot;If I can get more than half of my costume off by noon, then today counts asavictory.&quot; Garfield Minus Garfield The name says it all. Garfield Minus Garfield strips the cat out of the comic strip, leaving nothing but three panels of a lonely Jon Arbuckle. In the words of the site&apos;s creator, Dan Walsh: &quot;It is a journey deep into the mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness and depression in a quiet American suburb.&quot; Rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but there&apos;s something inherently comic about a recurringcartoon-cat-shaped lacuna. Even Garfield&apos;s original creator is afan. Food On My Dog  In comedy, the simplest ideas tendto be the best: what if I skipwith my arms by my sides? What if, instead of four candles, I want fork handles? Or, as in this case, what if I put food on my dog&apos;shead? The makers of this Tumblr do just that with their faithful and patient four-legged friend Tiger, posting a new photowith a new piece of food-based headwear everyday. Recentchoices include afortune cookie, an onion and a stick of candy floss. Tiger is fine with it,apparently.",

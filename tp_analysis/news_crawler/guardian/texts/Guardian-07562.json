    "text": "Bliss was it that dawn to be alive. In October 2010, George Osborne unveiled his comprehensive spending review. Defence spending was to drop. Welfare spending would be slashed. The average department was to see its budget hacked back by an eye-watering 19%. Schools, though, had been spared. This, everyone agreed, was fantastic. The only problem was, it wasn&apos;t true. The Department for Education&apos;s core resources budget had been protected (would rise, in fact, by the princely sum of 0.1% a year). But its capital budget  the bit that pays for buildings and so forth  was to fall by 60% over four years. That&apos;s more than twice the average across government. This wasn&apos;t a drop, it was a plummet. &quot;Capital departmental expenditure limit&quot; is the sort of phrase that makes people glaze over, so the government was largely spared the opprobrium that should have greeted that decision. But, in a competitive field, this might just be the biggest blunder to happen on Michael Gove&apos;s watch. Exhibit A is the state of our schools. Two years ago, Gove slammed Labour&apos;s 45bn Building Schools for the Future (BSF) scheme as overpriced and inefficient, and gleefully scrapped the thing. At the time, he promised to introduce a faster, more efficient alternative. That new scheme has yet to lay a brick. When it does, the lack of government capital means that, like BSF, it will be largely dependent on pricey private finance. Unlike BSF, however, it will be tiny. In the meantime, schools that were holding off on fixing the roof because they thought they were getting a new building are faced with enormous unexpected maintenance bills, and the local press is festooned with angry headteachers pointing at things. Exhibit B is the government&apos;s beloved free schools programme. More schools need more buildings, and buildings cost money: for the first wave, an average of 5m apiece. So far, talk of renting space out of their general budget has come to naught. That money is largely coming from the DfE&apos;s own capital budget. In other words, one of Michael Gove&apos;s pet policies is heavily reliant on the very budget his government so blithely cut. This, it seems likely, is one reason it has been unexpectedly slow out of the blocks. The big problem, though, is the baby boom. In 2010, there were four million children in English primary schools; by 2018, there&apos;ll be 4.5 million. Already stories are emerging of prefab buildings on playing fields, of two-shift schools or classrooms setting up in disused shops. Increasingly, the biggest story in education won&apos;t be about academies, or grade inflation, or international league tables: it&apos;ll be about parents petrified they can&apos;t find a school place for their child. All of these problems would be easier to tackle if the DfE had the money to pay for more buildings. The fact Gove squeezed another 1.2bn out of the Treasury last autumn suggests that he knows it. They were also all foreseeable in the sunlit days of 2010, which raises the question of why he accepted such a swingeing cut in the first place. One possibility is that he had no choice, and the cut was foisted on him by a tight-fisted Treasury. Another is that he was so desperate to read the headline, Schools Spending Protected, that he accepted an appalling capital settlement to make it happen. Or maybe he was still getting to grips with his brief: the 3.3bn schools capital budget for 2013-14 is, by historic standards, generous. Perhaps Gove thought it was enough. Or maybe the whole thing was political. The last government spent a fortune on whiteboards, atriums and award-winning architects; yet still England&apos;s schools tumbled down the international league tables. So when Gove cancelled BSF, he did so with a positive flourish. He was repudiating Labour&apos;s entire approach. Buildings don&apos;t matter, his aides have always said. It&apos;s what happens inside them that does. That&apos;s true, as far as it goes: there&apos;s little evidence a stunning building makes teaching any easier. But a bad one makes learning harder. In a classroom that is too hot, too crowded or falling to bits, concentration is affected. And tales of Labour waste will be scant comfort to those parents who can&apos;t find a school for their child at all.",

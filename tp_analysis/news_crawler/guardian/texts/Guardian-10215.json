    "text": "Wiping the slate clean Schools that are adjudged to be &quot;failing&quot; by Ofsted are automatically being taken out of that category if they close and reopen as an academy, Education Guardian has learned. Ofsted and the Department for Education are classing all such schools as &quot;new schools&quot; even though they are likely to reopen with most of the same staff, on the same site and with the same pupils and parents. Ofsted documents show, however, that any such school would still face a monitoring visit within two terms. The position came to light after parents at the former Downhills primary school in Haringey, north London, expressed confusion about its Ofsted status after it was forced by Michael Gove, the education secretary, to reopen as an academy under the sponsorship of the Harris chain in September. Downhills, which was in special measures when it closed, came out of that category when it reopened as Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane. An Ofsted spokeswoman confirmed: &quot;The Harris Academy Philip Lane is a new school  and has not received an [Ofsted] judgement yet.&quot; Jane Eades, national treasurer of the Anti-Academies Alliance, said: &quot;This looks like another, backdoor, way for the government to favour academies.&quot; A new future for 1994? These look like tough times for the 1994 Group, the umbrella grouping of smaller, research-intensive universities. Last week, Surrey became the third university, following Bath and St Andrews, to leave the group this autumn. This means its membership has been cut from 19 to 12 in a few months. Surrey&apos;s departure followed those of Exeter, York, Durham and Queen Mary, University of London to the rival Russell Group, which includes Oxbridge, earlier this year. So what is going on? A spokesman for the 1994 Group said a review into its future was under way, with some redefinition of purpose likely. He said: &quot;There is an elephant in the room: the Russell Group. It&apos;s the big daddy of mission groups. The question for other groups is: do we try to ape the dominant group or to carve out a distinct identity for ourselves? We are moving towards the latter.&quot; True cost of grading crisis  This year&apos;s GCSE English grading crisis is expected to have cost the taxpayer around 150,000 in consultants&apos; fees, documents from the exams regulator Ofqual reveal. A paper presented to Ofqual&apos;s board, dated 26 September, states that work commissioned by the regulator from the firm Cap Gemini in the light of the controversy was expected to cost around that sum. It &quot;has not been budgeted for&quot;, adds the paper. Ofqual&apos;s report supported its original decision not to offer a re-grade to pupils missing out on a C after grade boundaries were moved.",

    "text": "This week we feature an extended interview with a grandee of the environmental movement in the UK, former head of Friends of the Earth Tony Juniper. Tony&apos;s latest book answers the python-esque question What Has Nature Ever Done For Us? in compelling detail. To take a look at some of this week&apos;s science new stories, Alok is joined by Observer science editor Robin McKie and by Maria Botcharova, a freelance journalist and PhD student at University College London.  The team discusses research into why our fingers and toes wrinkle in water, and we hear from neurologist (and famed athlete) Sir Roger Bannister why this research could open up new territory in his field: the autonomic nervous system.  Robin talks about the likelihood of life on extrasolar moons and the role of Nasa&apos;s Kepler satellite in identifying candidates.

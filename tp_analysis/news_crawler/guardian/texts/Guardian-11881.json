    "text": "    This week, we meet gold, a chemical element with the atomic number 79 and the chemical symbol Au. The symbol comes from the Latin, aurum, which rather romantically refers to the yellow glow of sunrise.  As its name implies, gold is a lustrous yellow in colour. Besides being beautiful, gold is very useful because it is resistant to corrosion and to most chemical reactions, and it is the most malleable and ductile of all metals. In the wild, gold occurs most often in its pure elemental form as either nuggets, or as grains or veins in rock and in alluvial deposits. Occasionally, gold occurs as a compound in minerals, usually with tellurium. Unusual amongst elemental metals, which are either grey or white in colour, gold is bright yellow. This distinctive colour results from the oscillations of its loosely bound outer (valence) electrons. In fact, only one other elemental metal is yellow or gold-coloured; csium, and its colour is the result of similar effects.  Gold is of limited interest to biologists since it is not essential for life. However, it is used in research and medicine, especially as a thin coating for biological specimens viewed by scanning electron microscopy. It also is used for gold crowns in dentistry since over the long term, gold&apos;s malleability makes it less damaging than porcelain crowns to the grinding surface of molars.  At one time, consuming gold was erroneously thought to be beneficial for health (and still is, in some circles). Yet despite all the hype, metallic gold is inert to all body chemistry. Further, it has no taste, it provides no nutrition, and it leaves the body unaltered.  Gold was minted as coins from as early as 700 BC. Historically, gold was used as the standard for many currencies around the world and even today, it is stored it in the form of bullion coins or bars in the belief that it can protect its holder against inflation or other economic disruptions. (Visit a vault filled with gold bullion at the Bank of England.) Approximately half of the world&apos;s gold is used in jewelry, although it is typically alloyed with a number of other metals to increase its hardness and to alter its colour. For example, copper is the most commonly used base metal, which makes gold appear redder in colour. In addition to &quot;red gold&quot; (50% gold and 50% copper), and &quot;rose gold&quot; (75% gold with 25% copper), gold alloys range in colour from white to black. Some other colours include &quot;green gold&quot; (either 75% gold with 25% silver or 73% gold with 27% silver), and &quot;white gold&quot; (gold alloyed with one or more white metals, usually nickel, manganese or palladium). Chemistry owes much to our age-old fascination with gold. Alchemists famously tried all sorts of crazy experiments designed to transform lead into gold, usually through its interaction with the mythical philosopher&apos;s stone. Their keen interest in this fruitless endeavour provided valuable knowledge for how to identify and work with elements, which in turn, furnished the foundation for modern chemistry.  In this video, we watch several of our favourite chemistry professors as they discuss the wonders of gold and conduct an experiment to gold-plate a cheap casio watch:            [video link] Another quality of gold is its high density. The fact is that most of the Earth&apos;s gold lies at or near its core because the metal&apos;s high density caused it to sink when our planet was still molten. Thus, as proposed by a recent NATURE paper, all gold that has been found on or near the Earth&apos;s surface was probably deposited later by meteorites. This hypothesis also serves to explain why gold is found clustered only in some places on Earth (but not everywhere).  In this video, our favourite chemistry professor goes REALLY down under when he visits a gold mine in Australia, where he elaborates more on some of the qualities of gold:            [video link] .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

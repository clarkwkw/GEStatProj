    "text": "Your article &quot;Huge scale of UK&apos;s &apos;dash for gas&apos; revealed&quot; (News) was highly misleading. Government policy has not moved in favour of a &quot;dash for gas&quot;, and the amount of unabated gas generation we expect in 2030, far from quadrupling, has in fact reduced slightly. Before I correct your misreading of the figures, let me be very clear about our policy on gas generation. Unabated gas will continue to play an important role in our electricity mix into the 2020s and beyond, increasingly being used to back up intermittent generation such as wind and to provide variable supply alongside less flexible generation such as nuclear. That continued role is perfectly consistent with our legally binding carbon budgets, to which the coalition government remains utterly committed. Indeed, with carbon capture and storage, gas-fired power stations have an even longer-term place in the low-carbon economy of the future. Now to clear up the figures. It&apos;s important to distinguish actual generation from total capacity; the two measures can move in opposite directions. So, while projected capacity for electricity supply from unabated gas in 2030 has increased modestly, from 38.1GW (last year&apos;s projection) to 42.8GW, projected generation in the same year has reduced, from 127.7 terawatt hours to 123.9TWh. The figures you found &quot;buried&quot; in government documents (8GW and 31GW) are for the increase in new-build capacity, and were calculated differently, the former taking into account old power stations being closed down, the latter simply measuring all new capacity. It therefore makes no sense to compare the two figures, let alone to jump to the conclusion that government policy has changed. Edward Davey Secretary of state for energy and climate change All forms of energy will be needed if we are to meet demand and ensure security of supply. The debate should not be about gas versus renewables. In fact the two are complementary and we should look to a range of energy options and CO2 mitigation solutions. Using natural gas for power generation can make a significant contribution at the lowest cost to helping the UK meet its carbon reduction targets this decade. In the longer term, applying carbon capture and storage (CCS) can make gas  already the cleanest burning fossil fuel  even cleaner by capturing more than 90% of CO2 emitted. However, there remains an urgent need to demonstrate the technology, so it can be deployed at scale for the whole of society to benefit. Shell believes the UK has a unique chance to develop the world&apos;s first commercial-scale full-chain demonstration gas CCS project. It is crucial we seize this opportunity. Graham van&apos;t Hoff Chairman, Shell UK I admire Henry Porter&apos;s writing but his piece &quot;Forests, phone masts, roads  how our leaders scorn the countryside&quot; (Comment) commits, I think, an unforgivable sin, worthy of the Daily Mail. He condemns windfarms without any justification, whereas wind turbines are widely proven to be the cheapest and most efficient renewable method of counteracting global warming. The supporting picture of an extraordinarily beautiful view of trees in the autumn compounds, I think, the sin. And the windfarms are not going to be there forever  just until technology comes up with better solutions. Journalists who make such assertions should surely be required to explain the viable alternative courses of action on which their comments are founded.

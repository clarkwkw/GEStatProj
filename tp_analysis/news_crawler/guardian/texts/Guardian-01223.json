    "text": "Gove is all ears Michael Gove has faced  or rather, dodged  some difficult questions of late. Were private emails used for government business? Is he sure spending 60m of taxpayers&apos; money on a new yacht for the queen will boost public morale? And does he really have thousands of signed copies of the bible  intended for the nation&apos;s school children  stashed in a warehouse abroad? But there may be even tougher questions on the cards when he appears before the Education Select Committee today to answer quickfire questions solicited from the public via Twitter. The committee has been overwhelmed by the response to #AskGove, says its chair, Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness  not least the poor clerks who have spent hours trawling through some 3,000 questions, ranging from &quot;how can we better support children with special needs?&quot; to the rather less polite &quot;how do you sleep at night?&quot;. We&apos;ll be watching keenly to see if some of the more unusual tweets get their moment, such as: &quot;what makes you so certain that soldiers who are trained to kill and obey orders without question will make good teachers?&quot; &quot;Can you please tell George Osborne that he&apos;s totally rubbish at maths?&quot; And our personal favourite: &quot;We&apos;ve run out of milk. Will you nip down the shop and get some?&quot; Twittering heads A Suffolk academy head who publicly opposed plans for a free school has been ticked off by the organisation behind the proposals for airing his grievances via social media. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Roger Finbow, chair of governors at the Seckford Foundation  which owns a private school  says the behaviour of Jeremy Rowe, head of Sir John Leman high in Beccles, &quot;is not worthy of a headteacher who expects to be taken seriously&quot;. After hearing that the Seckford Foundation had got the green light to open a free school, Rowe started making regular tweets criticising the plans. He claims there is no need for any new schools in the county, and says he &quot;just can&apos;t stand by and let the future education of the children of Beccles go down the drain&quot;. Finbow says: &quot;We were asked by those in the Beccles community who wish for an alternative to Sir John Leman academy to support their  bid. The future education of the children of Beccles is a serious subject. It should not be trivialised by comments on Twitter.&quot; Two&apos;s company In November, we reported comments about the lacklustre contribution of the Skills Funding Agency chief, Geoff Russell, at the Association of Colleges&apos; annual conference. There was much grumbling about the brevity of his speech from college principals at the gala dinner, where one was overheard saying: &quot;I give him three months.&quot; Lo and behold, just seven weeks later, we learn that Russell is leaving in the summer. What was unexpected, though, was the announcement, on the same day, that the National Apprenticeship Service chief, Simon Waugh, is also stepping down, fuelling speculation in the sector on the reasons for the departures. But it seems the two organisations haven&apos;t quite got their story straight. While Waugh maintains that the announcement of two departures on the same day was &quot;coincidence&quot;, a press officer at the SFA said that Russell had handed his resignation in last August and &quot;it just made sense&quot; for the announcements to be made at the same time.",

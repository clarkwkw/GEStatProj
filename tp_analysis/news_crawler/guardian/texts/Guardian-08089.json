Look up when the sky is dark and clear, and you will see the stars. They look like small, twinkling points of light, but really they are suns. And our sun, which seems so brilliant during the daytime, is also a star, but is much closer than the stars we see atnight. Never look straight at the sun or you will hurt your eyes. The stars form groups called constellations. These were named by astronomers more than 1,000 years ago and look the same now as they did then. The planets are different from stars, but astronomers gave them names, which we still use. The moon shines by reflected sunlight and moves round the Earth. We can also see what look like moving stars, but these are satellites (spaceships that we have launched into space). It is nobody&apos;s responsibility to clear away old satellites. Some keep on going round the Earth for many years; others fall back into our atmosphere and become so hot by friction that they may burn away. Some are so huge, they do not burn away, and there is always a chance that falling satellites, or pieces of satellites, will hit the ground, although there have never been anyreports of people hurt or killed. There is always something new to see. If you decide to make a hobby of astronomy, you will always find something to interest you.

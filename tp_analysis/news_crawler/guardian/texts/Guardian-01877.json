[I will identify this species for you in 48 hours]  Image: Nick Athanas/Tropical Birding, 16 October 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorize].Canon EOS 7D    Question: This endangered Peruvian mystery bird has more genera than most of us have true friends. Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species -- and name all of its genera? Response: This is a russet-mantled softtail, Thripophaga berlepschi, a songbird that is grouped in with the Furnariidae, or ovenbirds. This is a large family of small suboscine passerines that live in Mexico, and Central and South America.  The russet-mantled softtail has been placed into three different genera, and currently is one of four species placed into Thripophaga. It also has been placed into the genus, Phacellodomus, along with eight other species as well as being grouped into Cranioleuca, a larger genus containing either 20 or 21 species. This passerine is rare and very localised in moist tropical and subtropical montane forests immediately below the treeline, thus, it is difficult to find. Once found, it is often difficult to see because it tends to forage alone or in pairs, avoiding mixed-species flocks. However, that said, if you do manage to locate and see this bird, you won&apos;t have to worry about confusing it with anything else because the combination of its montane habitat and plumage colour and pattern are distinctive. This species is endemic to forested mountains in the Andes of Peru at elevations ranging from 1,800-3,350 metres.

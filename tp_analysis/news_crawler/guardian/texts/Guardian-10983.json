    "text": "We walk along the perimeter of Marks Hall&apos;s extensive grounds and into my friend&apos;s childhood, each turn of the path sparking new memories: the air raid shelter he &quot;captured&quot; with friends; the winding path through pine trees where they imagined their futures. Even the majestic Honeywood oak, which has marked the woodland border for more than 800 years and now has a girth of 27 feet, was the namesake of his secondary school. We follow a straight line along the old deer fence, which was originally designed to keep deer inside the park but these days serves the opposite purpose. The same can&apos;t be said of the resident pheasant population, which is thriving  the branches ring with their metallic calls, like hundreds of knives being sharpened. We reach a clearing with an obelisk war memorial, and discover two cock pheasants sizing each other up. Wecreep nearer  although they are oblivious to our presence  and settle on a damp bench to watch. They appear evenly matched in size, although one is clearly the aggressor, his blue-green helmet of feathers catching the light as he steps forward. The second moves back, before thinking better of it, and thrusting his head to meet the attack. Incensed, the first jerkily bends his legs, and lifts half a metre into the air, both sets of claws aimed ninja-like at his opponent. Undaunted, the second reciprocates, and the pair flutter for several seconds, before reverting to the back and forth bobbing of heads which seems to serve as a breather. It&apos;s strange to think of these lumpy farm birds being skilled warriors, but here they seem dignified and, while violent, rather courteous: matching each other&apos;s moves exactly, and never resorting to pecking; it&apos;s all about stamina instead. We leave after 10 or so minutes of this routine, which still seems a long way from reaching a conclusion.",

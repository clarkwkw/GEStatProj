    "text": "Though Sly Cooper&apos;s been absent for eight years, the robbing raccoon&apos;s brand of stealthy platform gameplay still holds up. Cast into the time stream to save his ancestors and rebuild the Cooper family&apos;s tome of thieving knowledge, Sly&apos;s capers introduce various side characters, each with dedicated abilities to master. Sadly, while early story chapters are encouraging, later ones feel as if the developers ran out of ideas  another ice level, anyone? However, linking theVita and PS3 versions activates some impressive augmented reality features, and the whole package provesto be charming, if undemanding, fun.",

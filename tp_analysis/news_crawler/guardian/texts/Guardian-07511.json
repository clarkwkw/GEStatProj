    "text": "    Henri, le Chat Noir, is a philosophical 13-year-old tuxedo kitty who has lived his entire black-and-white life in Seattle. But astonishingly, he still speaks perfect French. In this video, Henri reminds us that he is the perfect bored house cat, filled with &quot;ennui and tuna.&quot;   This week&apos; Caturday morning video smile features Henri telling us about his recent visit to the veterinarian.             [video link] Music: &quot;The Good and Bad Heart&quot;, by Will Braden. Filmed at the Green Lake Animal Hospital in Seattle.  Henri le chat noir has his own website and is on facebook and twitter @HenriLeChatNoir .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  NOTE: the silly cat/pet/animal videos shared here on Saturday (Caturday) mornings are intended to amuse. This feature is designed to help hard-working and stressed-out people shed their professional faade so they can be better friends, companions, parents, family members and drinking pals to those in their personal lives. Any relationship between these videos and science or any scientific principle is sweet when I manage to present a solid connection to you, but is random, usually coincidental and (mostly) unintended.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientistevil google+: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

We have it sitting on the windowsill, and have started recording the pressure in a little notepad, along with other weather observations. Sure, it&apos;s only a highly localized (and cut-down) version of what the Met Office gives us, but there&apos;s something very satisfying (not to mention geeky) about recording data and trying to draw correlationswhether it be the effect of different media on bacterial growth rates or the variation of barometric pressure with local weather. Once a scientist, always a scientist; regardless of the field; no doubt we&apos;ll soon be investing in an outdoor thermometer, rain gauge, wind vane and whatever other paraphernalia we can think of.  It having been Christmas, other families in our block of flats have also been sharing gifts.

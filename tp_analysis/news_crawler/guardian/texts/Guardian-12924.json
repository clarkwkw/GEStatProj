    "text": "Walking down the steep slope into the woodland flanking the River Affric my route was treacherous. Swift rivulets ofwater drained from the deep bog pools where I looked in vain for the first for me  of this year&apos;s frogspawn. Ihad already had reports of spawn laidon at Ardnamurchan on 4 February but failed to find any. By the fast-flowing river with its dark and mysterious eddying pools, the trees started to encompass me. Little wonder, as I was in one of the largest remaining tracts of the ancient Caledonian pine forest. Some of the most impressive trees were the Scots pine that appeared twisted, gaunt and dark against the backcloth of the snow-capped hills. A closer look revealed their true colours , with the red of the upper stemscontrasting against dark green foliage. Close up the lower trunks were a blend of reds, greys and browns of thedeeply fissured bark. The Scots pine is often termed the &quot;king of the forest&quot;, so I do not understand why there is now discussion as to which might be adopted as a national tree for Scotland. Surely it is already theScots pine, by virtue of its name, importance and endurance. There are, arguably, only two native conifers to the UK and the other  the juniper  was present. Some, at four metres tall or more, dwarfed me and seemed forbidding, perhaps because they are forever associated with a symbol against witches and devils. With my mind running riot I would not have been surprised if a wild boar had suddenly charged from the undergrowth. Fanciful? Not any more, as there are now wild boar living and breeding &quot;in the wild&quot; just south of Glen Affric and on the west side of the Great Glen and Loch Ness.",

    "text": "Developed by the UK studio Rebellion, NeverDead is something of a welcome surprise  a fun third-person shoot-&apos;em-up with a novel gameplay twist. Player-character Bryce, a world-weary and wisecracking demon hunter with a history of hatred for the undead, is immortal. His limbs fly off, but he will keep fighting, though with incrementally less ability as he takes more damage. Desperate scrambles for errant body parts add an extra layer of tension to the numerous, and usually impressive, setpieces. Apart from this one smart idea, however, the game tends to sag. Badly implemented level design can lead to frequent breaks in tension, and clumsy weapon physics reduce a number of fights to blind luck. The voice acting starts out lovably rough around the edges, but after a while, the one-dimensional characterisation begins to grate. A shame as just a little more care could have produced something really quite special.",

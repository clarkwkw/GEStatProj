    "text": "Resident Evil creator Shinki Mikami has announced his latest project. Zwei (a &apos;codename&apos; apparently, so expect a new title before release) will be a survival horror adventure, which would seem to be harking back to the original spirit of Capcom&apos;s classic zombie series.  &quot;A true &apos;survival horror&apos; game is one in which the player confronts and overcomes fear,&quot; said Mikami, who departed the Resident Evil team after the fourth title, and now heads up his own studio, Tango Gameworks. &quot;I&apos;ve found my focus and once again I&apos;m striving for pure survival horror. I am being very hands-on in the development of this game to ensure that the quality is there. Rest assured.&quot; Mikami&apos;s last project was the highly regarded third-person shooter Vanquish for Platinum Games. He hasn&apos;t worked on an all-out horror game since his transfer to the much-hyped Clover Studio in 2004. Publisher Bethesda is not saying anything about the game just yet, but has released a collage of environment images, depicting a darkened dockyard and silhouetted boats. It&apos;s likely we&apos;ll find out much more  or at least what platforms it&apos;s coming to, at E3.",

In this image, taken over Washington state, the diagonal line running next to the Touchet River is a road that connects the town of Prescott to the west to Waitsburg to the east Photograph: KARI/ESA       The Great Sandy Desert of northwestern Australia is an area of active sand dune movement. The white feature visible down the centre of this image, taken on 25 March, is Lake Auld. The white colour is the result of a cemented combination of fine clayey sediment and salts from evaporated flood waters that occasionally fill the lake Photograph: ISS/NASA       In southern California the Salton Sea is shown flanked by a checkerboard of irrigated farmland stretching northward and southward from the artificial inland sea in this image taken on 24 March Photograph: Landsat/NASA       An area in the north-west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of the lighter green areas are deforested, while the darker green are areas of dense and possibly natural vegetation. The lines cutting through the image are roads, many with structures built along them. Clusters of purple dots are larger settlements. A river snakes through the upper part of the image and below it there appears to be a square in light green. Judging by the precision of the outline, we can deduce that this is a patch of land that was either intentionally spared from deforestation or has been reforested Photograph: SPOT-4/ESA       A nocturnal image of the area of Phoenix, Arizona, taken on 16 March. Like many large urban areas of the central and western US, the Phoenix metropolitan area is laid out along a regular grid of city blocks and streets. The image area includes parts of several cities in the metropolitan area including Phoenix proper (right), Glendale (centre), and Peoria (left) Photograph: ISS/NASA       Severe flooding in La Plata, Argentina, on 4 April. Torrential rains and record flash flooding killed more than 50 people and left thousands homeless. La Plata is located 20 miles (50 kilometers) from Buenos Aires. In the image, flooded areas east and west of the city appear in dark blue. A heavy sediment load gives the Rio Plata its yellow-brown color. The image covers an area of 16 miles by 17 miles Photograph: ASTER/Terra/NASA       A thick plume of dust blows over the eastern Mediterranean sea on 1 April, extending northward from Egypt towards Turkey in a giant, anti-clockwise arc. Between Egypt and Turkey, dust clogged skies over Israel, the West Bank and Cyprus. Outside of the Nile River Valley and Delta, Egypt's land is a dry desert plateau, whose sand can feed dust storms Photograph: MODIS/Terra/NASA       Springtime in the Bay of Biscay, off the coast of France, as in most places, is a season of abundant growth. This image, taken on 20 April, shows a phytoplankton bloom. The swirling colors indicate the presence of vast numbers of phytoplankton,  tiny plant-like microorganisms that live in both fresh and salt water. Although these organisms live year-round in the Bay of Biscay, it is only when conditions are right that explosive blooms occur Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA       Thetford Forest, which straddles the north of Suffolk and the south of Norfolk in England, is pictured on 27 December 2012 (left) and then on 27 January 2013 (right) after snowfall Photograph: ALI/EO-1/NASA       A patchwork of national forests in the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest of North America on 30 March. The newest Landsat satellite  the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM)  picks up the wide range of colours, topography, and brightness of the area Photograph: OLI/LDCM/NASA       The West African fire season heated up in late March. On 30 March hundreds of fires light up the landscape of the coastal county of Sierra Leone and the inland regions of Guinea. Fires are also scattered throughout Liberia (south). In this region, fire and human activity is tightly coupled with savanna ecology. Fire is often deliberately set as a tool for agricultural management of land. This includes removing crop residue, renewing pasture growth, clearing fields and driving pests and game. While the source of fires is impossible to directly discern from space, the pattern seen here is typical for fires primarily of agricultural origin Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA       Farmers in New Zealand rejoiced in mid-April when rains started to break one of the worst droughts to hit the country in decades. The situation on North Island, in particular, had worsened throughout March. The landscape in the image on the right, taken on 10 April 2013, is considerably browner than in April 2009, a more typical year, as shown on the left Photograph: MODIS/Terra/NASA       The Zambezi River forms part of the border between Zambia and Namibia, where the Caprivi Strip juts eastward from the rest of Namibia on 31 March. Flowing down a gentle gradient in this region, the Zambezi often spills on to floodplains during the rainy season, with water levels peaking between February and April. Although the Zambezi watered its floodplains generously in late March 2013, conditions were fairly dry for the season Photograph: ALI/EO-1/NASA       The Lighthouse Atoll in the Belize Barrier Reef. In the upper-central part of the image, an underwater sinkhole known as the Great Blue Hole appears as a dark blue circle. Surrounded by the shallow waters of the coral reef, the Great Blue Hole measures over 300 metres in diameter and about 123 metres deep. Formed when the sea level was much lower, rain and chemical weathering eroded the exposed terrain. Water later filled the hole and covered the area when the sea level rose at the end of the ice age. Also visible in the image are two coral islands, green with vegetation, called cayes. The larger island to the west is Long Caye, and the smaller Half Moon Caye is to the east Photograph: ALOS/ESA       The river-delineated border between western Brazil's Acre province (upper left), and northwestern Bolivia's Pando department (lower right), demarcates a remarkable difference in land use. Brazil has opened up this part of the rainforest to farming and settlement, producing the herringbone pattern of forest cutting. This part of Bolivia, on the other hand, preserves its native rainforest, untouched by development. The image was acquired in July 2008 but only released on 16 April 2013 Photograph: ASTER/Terra/NASA       Clouds and icebergs surround the snow-covered island of South Georgia on 10 April. Each year as temperatures warm, Antarctic glaciers crack and drop pieces into the Southern Ocean. Once afloat, these newly calved icebergs begin a slow journey, drifting with the prevailing currents. South Georgia acts as an iceberg trap, with a continental shelf that extends more than 50km from the coast. While smaller icebergs can flow by, big bergs often become grounded and slowly decay Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA       When John Wesley Powell led an expedition down the Colorado River and through the Grand Canyon in 1869, he was confronted with a daunting landscape. At its highest point, the serpentine gorge plunged 2,400 metres (8,000 feet) from rim to river bottom, making it the deepest canyon in the US. In this image, taken on 30 March, the Colorado River traces a line across the arid Colorado Plateau. Treeless areas are beige and orange; green areas are forested. The river water is brown and muddy, a common occurrence in spring when melting snows cause water levels to swell and pick up extra sediment. The black line that follows the river in the upper right side of the image is comprised of shadows Photograph: OLI/LDCM/NASA       Snow covers southern Scandinavia on 23 March. Norway, with the snow-shrouded Scandinavia Mountains lies in the west, and Sweden lies in the east. Ice covers the southern portion of Sweden's bi-lobed Lake Vanern (west), while Lake Vattern (east), appears ice-free. In the south, on the lower edge of the image, the tip of Denmark also wears a mantle of winter white. Tan and teal-colored swirls paint the water of the North Sea on Denmark's western coast, possibly arising from an early phytoplankton bloom, sediment from coastal run-off or perhaps a combination of the two Photograph: MODIS/Terra/NASA       By late March, Arctic sea ice was beginning its seasonal decline. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the total extent of Arctic sea ice in 2013 was well below average through March, although it was not a record low. On 31 March the Gulf of Bothnia still carried a thick mantle of white, especially in the far north. The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea, and lies between Finland to the east and Sweden to the west Photograph: MODIS/Terra/NASA  ",

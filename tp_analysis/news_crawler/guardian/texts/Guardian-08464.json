    "text": "The very name Les Ebdon  which sounds as if it belongs to a militant trade union leader or northern comedian  seems to provoke Tory backbenchers, public school heads and Oxbridge academics. They should relax. Whatever his ambitions, the new director of the Office for Fair Access can do little to compel the ancient universities to admit more students from comprehensives. The few powers he has  to fine universities or impose cuts in fees  are politically impossible to use. The universities say that they don&apos;t get enough applications from pupils at maintained schools; and those they do get often have the wrong A-level grades in the wrong subjects. We shall, therefore, see more of the same: summer schools, college open days, and pleas to teachers to cultivate &quot;aspiration&quot;. None of this will ever be enough. As Ebdon himself says, millions of ordinary families believe Oxford and Cambridge &quot;are not for the likes of us&quot;. Unfortunately, they are right. A third of all admissions to Oxbridge go to just 100 schools. Eton and Westminster each send around 100 pupils to Oxford or Cambridge every year. Those students already know many of their fellow undergraduates and can share in-jokes, catchphrases, memories and social contacts. They feel instantly at home in Oxbridge colleges which look like their schools. Their teaching was specifically geared to Oxbridge requirements. It is hardly surprising that 18-year-olds from northern comprehensives fear being out of place. College open days, where they get first-hand experience of the Oxbridge social mix, may even accentuate their concerns. The peer group  and a sense of who belongs on which territory  is of paramount importance to an 18-year-old. It explains why, in the inner-city, so many join gangs. Elite universities provide territory for gangs formed in public schools. Attempts to widen Oxbridge entry face a chicken-and-egg conundrum. Oxbridge says it can&apos;t recruit more from the state sector until schools send them more highly qualified pupils. The schools say the pupils won&apos;t go  or won&apos;t aspire to go  until the universities appear less exclusive. Bold measures are needed to break this impasse. Suppose Oxford and Cambridge were to ask every state school to identify, at 15, its brightest pupils academically (one, two or three, depending on size). Suppose those pupils were given every possible support and guidance in A-level subject choice and teaching. Suppose they were invited annually to week-long summer schools where they could form their own peer networks of solidarity and support. Suppose, above all, Oxbridge allocated to this pool of talent a fixed proportion of its places  initially, perhaps, 70%, but rising to over 90%, so that its UK intake became representative of the general school population  with those who did best at A-level getting preference. Would academic standards collapse? Would Oxford and Cambridge lose their positions as &quot;world-class&quot; universities? Surely not. Several research studies show that, on average, students from maintained schools perform better in degree exams than their fee-charging-school counterparts with the same A-level grades. What we do not know  because they never get the chance  is how well those with lower A-level grades would perform. But it is possible that, given incentives and support, most of those selected would achieve top grades in any case. Those not selected, along with pupils from fee-charging schools, would compete for the remaining places or simply apply to any of the other 100-odd UK universities, some of which are quite good. Since pupils&apos; home background would be irrelevant  there would be nothing to stop the middle-classes gaming the system as usual  this cannot be described as social engineering. It would be educational engineering. Oxford and Cambridge would have access to wider and more diverse talent. The chief incentive for parents to send their children to fee-charging schools  that they maximise chances of Oxbridge entry  would disappear overnight. Middle-class parents would clamour to get their children into comprehensives in disadvantaged areas in hope of them grabbing one of those precious places. The influx of more aspirational families would raise standards more effectively than anything governments have done in the past 30 years. And as a welcome by-product, Britain would be free at last of one of its chief sources of social division.  Mike Baker is unwell.",

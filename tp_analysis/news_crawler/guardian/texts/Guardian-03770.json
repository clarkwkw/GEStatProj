    "text": "    I love how, in spring, the world is transformed overnight from a silent, brooding place into a riot of colour, exploding with the cries of hungry baby birds, each one a hope for the future.    This charming video captures a pair of American robins, Turdus migratorius, that nested in a hanging basket of flowers on the videographer&apos;s porch. Through the four week period of filming, the video captures the hen patiently incubating her clutch of four pale blue eggs through rain and shine, and then follows the parents raising their hungry chicks, starting by feeding worms that are nearly as big as each newly-hatched chick, until the youngsters leave home. I think the end is particularly amusing and touching.       [video link]  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  NOTE: the silly cat/pet/animal videos shared here on Saturday (Caturday) mornings are intended to amuse. This feature is designed to help hard-working and stressed-out people shed their professional faade so they can be better friends, companions, parents, family members and drinking pals to those in their personal lives. Any relationship between these videos and science or any scientific principle is sweet when I manage to present a solid connection to you, but is random, usually coincidental and (mostly) unintended.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist Pinterest: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

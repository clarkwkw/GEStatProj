    "text": "God gave PDF to journal articles and ePub to monographs. And then he decided to wrap those monographs in digital rights management (DRM). Why? The journal article  portable and easy to annotate  is flourishing in the digital age, while the scholarly book is languishing on a shelf or trapped in a Kindle. Right now academic books are painful to read in digital form, for no good reason. This is easy to fix: publish books as DRM-free PDF files. Just like journal articles. I groan inside when I discover that a piece of academic writing I want is trapped in a book. I know that it&apos;s torture to get those words into a format that I can actually use. So instead I read and annotate journal articles. Open access is not the issue. Right now most academic journals and books have a price, and yet journal articles  once they&apos;re bought directly or through institutional subscriptions  arrive as encumbrance-free PDF files. But publishers lock books down, and then distribute them in proprietary and incompatible formats. Like the music industry circa 2005. One day, the PDF, faithful to its print counterpart, may be surpassed by a new format untethered to print conventions like the &apos;page&apos;. Though the PDF can embed video and other media, the user experience across reading software is wonky. Something better may come along. Until then we have the humble PDF. It&apos;s an open standard. And its digital-facsimile approach, for now, fits academic workflows best. Page citations are identical for PDFs and their printed doppelgngers. PDFs are simple to annotate in any number of desktop and mobile apps. Their text layers get indexed by desktop search tools like the Mac&apos;s Spotlight, so that an obscure passage from a long-forgotten article can be instantly recalled. In an age of over-sharing, the passed-along academic PDF is almost always welcome. Sites like academia.edu and the digital repositories of academic libraries circulate published and work-in-progress manuscripts in what has become the lingua formata. Books are the remaining holdout. Most ebooks come chained with DRM, which makes sharing, say, a chapter nearly impossible. Page numbers can&apos;t be cited because most ebooks are &apos;reflowable&apos; to adapt to different screen sizes and font preferences. The one-big-flow approach also renders footnotes (but not endnotes) unusable. Some publishers, like the University of Chicago Press sell PDF version of their books, but these come wrapped in Adobe&apos;s DRM, with bizarre and maddening print and sharing restrictions. Even worse, the DRM  and, in some cases, the proprietary format  means that you can&apos;t read your book wherever and whenever you want. Apple&apos;s iBooks, for example, can&apos;t even be read on the company&apos;s own Mac computers. Even when it&apos;s technically possible to read your book across devices, you face a Babel-like din of device-specific apps for each major platform. It&apos;s true that annotation tools exist in most apps, but exporting these is a head-scratcher for all the major formats. There are workarounds for these problems. Sometimes I use the open-source, cross-platform ebook software Calibre with easy-to-download plugins  to strip away the DRM and convert books to PDF. This works, but the resulting PDF is a mess. More often than not, I purchase or check out a paper version, and scan each page. After optical character recognition (OCR), the book is ready to read and annotate. That&apos;s a lot of work, and who has the time or the energy? In practice, many academics accustomed to digital reading have come to ignore books. The DRM and other restrictions are sand in the gears, friction enough to redirect our attention to journal articles. Books, as a result, aren&apos;t being read  or sold. My guess is that the format discrepancy has had measurable effects on relative citation rates, depressing those for books. And for a silly reason: an arbitrary format choice. Length, after all, is the only meaningful distinction between an article and a book. Various &apos;short&apos; academic forms, with word-counts falling between the typical article and book, are sure to emerge, on the model of the already popular Kindle Single. The format gap between books and articles, arbitrary now, will only seem weirder as the formal distinctions blur. JSTOR&apos;s new books initiative is a refreshing contrast to existing models. Libraries can opt to purchase &apos;multi-user&apos; book licenses that permit its readers to download DRM-free PDF chapters as often as they want. As JSTOR&apos;s own marketing literature stresses, a multi-user book &quot;behaves just like journal content on JSTOR&quot;. Project MUSE, the Johns Hopkins University Press collaboration, hosts a similar initiative, as does Oxford University Press. Amen. But these laudable efforts don&apos;t offer anything to the scholarly book-buying public. I would gladly pay list price for a DRM-free PDF ebook, but don&apos;t yet have that option. I certainly won&apos;t be buying another locked-down ePub at any price. I doubt that I am alone. For a typical reader consuming a trade book, the format may not matter. But scholars don&apos;t read supine, snacking on grapes; we need to annotate, search, print and share. And for that we need a standard, open format like PDF. For disciplines like history that centre on book-length contributions, the DRM/ePub standard may act like a tax on intellectual fecundity. But it doesn&apos;t have to be that way. God (or the publishers) could give PDF to monographs too.

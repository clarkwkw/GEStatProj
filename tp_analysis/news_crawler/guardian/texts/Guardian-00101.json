    "headline": "Science Museum should drop Statoil sponsorship of childrens gallery", 
    "text": "On Tuesday, the Science Museum will launch its new interactive gallery for children  Wonderlab: The Statoil Gallery. Despite securing sponsorship from an oil and gas company that is recklessly planning to drill seven new wells in the fragile Arctic, the London museum has also introduced an entry charge, restricting access tothose visitors able to pay. It is unconscionable that in 2016 a museum of science is handing a fossil fuel company legitimacy by allowing it to sponsor a gallery designed to inspire the next generation. Statoil is pursuing new sources of oil that must stay in the ground if there is to be any hope of leaving a safe climate for the children that are to visit this gallery. And from the Norwegian Arctic to the Great Australian Bight, Statoils plans are opposed by local communities and indigenous peoples who want the company off their lands and out of their waters. Putting a charge on galleries aimed at children denies those from less privileged backgrounds the opportunity to become engaged in science and excited by the renewable energies that will play a vital role in their future. It is unacceptable for the Science Museum and Statoil to make future generations pick up the bill for their ill-made decisions. Wonderlabs entry charge and its unethical sponsor must both be dropped.Bill McKibben Author, educator, environmentalist and co-founder of 350.orgProfessor Jonathan Oppenheim Royal Society university research fellow, department of physics and astronomy, University College LondonDr Stuart Parkinson Executive director, Scientists for Global ResponsibilityDr Douglas Parr Chief scientist, Greenpeace UKCaroline Lucas MP and Jonathan Bartley Co-leaders, Green partyProfessor Simon L Lewis Professor of global change science, UCLDr Sarah Bell Senior lecturer in environmental engineering, UCLDr Stephen Webster Director, Imperial College science communication unitDr Philip Webber Chair, Scientists for Global ResponsibilityStephen Kretzmann Executive director, Oil Change InternationalGunnar Kvle Professor emeritus, Centre for International Health, University of Bergen, NorwayDanny Chivers Author of The No-Nonsense Guide to Climate ChangeDr Victoria Johnson Research associate, Sustainable Consumption Institute, University of ManchesterProfessor David Colquhoun FRS Professor of pharmacology, UCLProfessor Richard Ashcroft Professor of bioethics, Queen Mary University of LondonDr David Kirby Senior lecturer in science communication studies, University of ManchesterDr Emily Dawson Lecturer in science communication, UCLDr David McCoy MedactDr Felicity Mellor Senior lecturer, Imperial College science communication unitProf Andy Stirling SPRU, University of SussexDr Matt Folley Senior research fellow, School of Natural and Built Environment, Queens University BelfastDr Alice Bell Former Science Museum employeeDr Sarah Davies University of CopenhagenDrew Pearce PhD science researcher and member of Progressive Science InstituteBeth Rice PhD science researcher and member of Progressive Science InstituteDr David Hookes Honorary senior research fellow, Department of Computer Science, Liverpool UniversitySophia Collins Science engagement specialistPhil Ball Environmental activist and member of the Arctic 30Clara Paillard President of PCS culture sectorSophia McNab UK Youth Climate CoalitionMads Flarup Christensen Executive director, Greenpeace NordicBunna Lawrie Mirning elder and whale songman, Nullarbor/Great Australian BightPeter Owen Director, Wilderness Society South AustraliaNnimmo Bassey Health of Mother Earth Foundation, poetMaja Ratkje Musician and member of Stopp Oljesponsing av Norsk Kulturliv (End Oil Sponsorship of the Arts Norway)Claire James National coordinator of Campaign Against Climate ChangeDavid Powell New Economics FoundationAlmuth Ernsting Co-director, BiofuelwatchMartin Hagfors Musician, End Oil Sponsorship of the Arts NorwayElin Vister Artist, End Oil Sponsorship of the Arts NorwayHasse Farmen Musician, End Oil Sponsorship of the Arts NorwayIan Pocock London Campaign Against the Arms TradeDr Anna Galkina PlatformBergljot Gjelsvik BP or not BP?Lola Perrin Composer and pianistFeral X Activist and projection artistRob Burbea Composer, Dharma Action Network for Climate EngagementDr Chris Garrard Composer, musicologist and environmental campaignerJames Simon Telford Musicologist, composer and sound artistEmma Johnston Primary school teacher  Join the debate  email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",

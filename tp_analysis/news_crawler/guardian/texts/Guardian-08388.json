    "text": "It&apos;s not just the prospect of organised fun and budget cooking that makes freshers week seem daunting  it&apos;s the myth that the first seven days you spend on campus will determine the rest of your university experience. What happens if, despite the low-priced alcohol and fancy dress parties, you don&apos;t make any friends in your first week? It may be a horrifying thought, but it&apos;s not that uncommon. Finding friends in freshers week is difficult, especially if you&apos;re living at home, says Tom Pratt, who has just completed a master&apos;s at Birmingham University. &quot;Easily the worst time for me was freshers week. When I travelled to university, it was just me  I didn&apos;t see anybody I knew and I walked around completely on my own not the best impression of university life.&quot; Similarly, a current Phd student who wished to remain anonymous said she also had a rough start to first year. &quot;When I started I was in a student flat with three party animals and one strict Christian. I fall into neither of these groups. Also, because my student loan hadn&apos;t come in time I couldn&apos;t afford a fresher pass. I didn&apos;t know you could buy tickets on the night, so I spent the whole of freshers week in my room on my own.&quot; So what can you do if the worst happens and you don&apos;t meet your new best friend by day five? Camp out in the library and resign yourself to social Siberia? Go home? Freshers week is an ice-breaker and it can help you get over the first few nights spent away from home, but don&apos;t overestimate its importance. My own freshers experience was not that positive. I developed a nasty chest infection that meant I couldn&apos;t go out much in the first term and I didn&apos;t get on well with the people I lived with. But although first term was hard, I soon found close friends on my course and at my student newspaper. The best thing to do in freshers week is join a society and go along to their events. If you&apos;re living at home, most universities have a home students society where you can find people that live nearby to share taxis with after nights out. If you&apos;re in halls with people you don&apos;t get along with stay polite, but forget about them. Go out and get involved with sports or societies instead. It&apos;s a lot easier to make friends with people who share your interests than people with whom you share a bathroom. Freshers week is not the defining moment of your university career and the choices you make in the next seven days will not haunt you for the rest of your life  it&apos;s unlikely you&apos;ll even remember them in a year&apos;s time.",

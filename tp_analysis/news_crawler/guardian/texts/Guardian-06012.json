    "text": "It has been asserted that all animals, with two exceptions, swim naturally, the reason being that they use their ordinary methods of progression, which are suitable for aquatic locomotion for a time. The exceptions are monkey and man, the one naturally arboreal, the other descended from arboreal stock; these two attempt to climb out of the water by instinctive graspings for branches above, and fail. The statement is a sweeping one, and there are probably many other exceptions, but it is called to my mind by a letter from a correspondent. When he was fishing in Furness he surprised a pheasant and chicks. The old bird flew across the stream and the chicks, or some of them, swam lightly after her. This, according to the line of argument, would show that walking was the ancestral habit of the pheasant; the chicks moved their limbs as if walking; and travelled safely across the water. But the passerine bird, if it falls into water, will swim by flying along the surface, but is drowned when its feathers get water-logged; and some birds, even passerines, have developed a habit of flying under water. It is too big a question to discuss fully, but it is certainly interesting to hear that the pheasant chicks swam.",

    "text": "There is something magical about the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. For me, autumn represents a period of change when nature girds its loins for the long and slow descent into winter. Just occasionally we&apos;re graced with an Indian summer. The extra boost of warmth on our faces this late sun provides give us that last opportunity to secure a dose of vitamin D, but it is with a sense of foreboding that we watch as the trees begin to cast long shadows. These shady places are of course in stark contrast to the &quot;golden light&quot; created from the sun&apos;s position as it steadily becomes pulled ever closer to the horizon, making this a great season for beautifully lit and atmospheric photography. The season has, almost by default, become defined by its most powerful images: that of leaves changing colour. Whether it be the buttery yellows of birches, the vivid reds of sycamores or the burning gold of beech trees, autumn colour is an ephemeral spectacle that is not just confined to a few choice nature reserves, but a treat that can be seen just about anywhere. When certain environmental factors combine to make the annual event a year of exceptional quality, the sheer intensity of colours can combine to make the observer feel giddy or light-headed. In this digital age, many sightseers now often seem obsessed with attempting to capture this spectacle for time immemorial. For me it&apos;s an infinitely far more enjoyable experience when the image is burnt onto your retina rather than on a memory stick. In fact this is simply a spectacle that demands you to stop, stare and admire. Seasonal mellowness aside, an autumnal storm is more than capable of creating an equally memorable experience. With gun-metal skies, the accompanying wind and rain can often combine forces to bring the colourful display to an abrupt end as the now-tinted leaves begin to be mercilessly ripped from their moorings. But these lashings never last for too long and the period of freshness which invariably follows a downpour has to be one of the best times for a nature ramble. As the leaves fall and the trees prepare for winter, the woodland creatures are also busily making preparations for the lean times ahead. While some mammals are winding down, the much loved red squirrel is more frenetic than ever, as it gorges on fruit and stockpiles nuts like its life depends on it  which it will. Once relatively common, our only native squirrel has declined dramatically over the past 50 years  in England they are now restricted to just a few locations. Fortunately a trip to one of its strongholds, such as Brownsea Island in Dorset, or Formby on the Lancashire coast, will rarely disappoint. But be warned, you&apos;ll need to be either quick off the mark, or very still to capture them on camera. Having just acquired their thick winter coats, autumn is also undoubtedly the time of year when these enchanting ginger rodents look their most dapper. Undoubtedly one of the most dramatic autumnal moments is the majesty and raw power of the red deer rut. Seeing evenly matched stags size each other up before clashing in a titanic battle, whether it be in London&apos;s Richmond Park or the Highlands of Scotland, is an experience that you&apos;ll never forget. The unfolding drama as the stags compete to be the winner &quot;that takes all&quot; is a scene that has played out since primeval times. As ever, patience and a good eye are needed to catch the moment when the two dominant stags decide to dispense with the talk and get on with the action! And what about the kingdom of the fungi? The mild, wet conditions created by autumn represents the perfect time for a huge array of mushrooms and toadstools to cast their introverted nature aside as they finally push their heads above of the soil to distribute their spores. Representing the full gamut of shapes, sizes and colour, fungi are the perfect subjects for honing macrophotographic skills. For my money, the only way to become immersed in all that the natural world has to offer is to get yourself out on a Great British Wildlife Walk  something that the National Trust is encouraging us all to do this autumn. Irrespective of whether it&apos;s a brief stroll around your local park or a whole day spent in the back of beyond, one thing is for sure, your visit will be time well spent. There are no rules to follow when out and about save one: enjoy it. A walk on the wild-side is also an assault on the senses, so don&apos;t forget to use them, whether it be listening to the local robin holding its territory for the winter, the musty smell of a neighbourhood fox or a brief glimpse of a deer. The beauty of technology these days means that you can now create wonderful images, whether you have state-of-the-art camera kit or a just a mobile phone. So enjoy the photographic revolution, get yourself outside and capture the essence of autumn  you won&apos;t regret it!

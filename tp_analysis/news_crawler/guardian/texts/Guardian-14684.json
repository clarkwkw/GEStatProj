    "text": "&quot;Assuming most academics give lectures, aren&apos;t we all specialists in public speaking?&quot; tweeted Martin George, lecturer in law at the University of Birmingham. In essence, he is true, given that the role of an academic is to both teach and produce research, offering plenty of opportunities to speak in public, whether in a lecture hall or presenting research at a conference. But brilliant academics are not necessarily brilliant public speakers. As Paul Edwards, professor of information and history at the University of Michigan, writes in his paper, How to Give an Academic Talk: &quot;You&apos;ve seen it a hundred times. The speaker approaches the head of the room and sits down at the table. She/he begins to read from a paper, speaking in a soft monotone. Sentences are long, complex, and filled with jargon. With five minutes left in the session, the speaker suddenly looks at his/her watch. [The speaker] announces in apparent surprise that they have to omit the most important points because time is running out.&quot; Although giving a paper is part of academic culture, professors often fail to recognise that presentations are not journal articles, says Edwards. &quot;They&apos;re a completely different medium of communication and they require a different set of skills,&quot; he adds.  With the advancement of digital learning technologies such as TEDx, the bar has been raised in terms of how to maintain an audience&apos;s attention while effectively communicating your ideas across.  Jazzy visual aids may prove useful, but are not necessarily the answer. In this live chat we want to strip the whole process back to basics and focus on the speech itself and ask: how can you make your talk persuasive, interesting and entertaining in different academic settings? Public speaking isn&apos;t something that comes naturally to everyone, but seeing as it plays such an important role in an academic&apos;s career, we want to use this opportunity to discuss some rules of thumb and look at what works and what doesn&apos;t.  So join us Friday 26 April 12-2pm BST to discuss vocal techniques, handling questions, planning ahead and timing.

    "text": "Write for rights The year was 1948. The world was still reeling from the atrocities committed in the second world war, which left many people missing their relatives, their homes and some, their lives. The world&apos;s answer to this was a bit of paper, containing 30 articles that all humans should be entitled to. So on a rainy day on 10th December, the leaders of 48 countries stood together in a spirit of brotherhood and vowed that history would never repeat itself. They promised that every single person, whoever they were, wherever they were from, would be entitled to freedom of speech, the right to life and the right to peacefully protest. So, 64 years later, how have the governments measured up? Since 1948, how many more wars have been fought? How many people will be spending tonight in a freezing prison cell, hundreds of miles away from their families, nearly fainting from starvation, simply because they staged a peaceful protest? How many children have been denied an education and will be pacing the streets tonight with a gun around their neck? Let me ask you what you are going to do? Sit down and watch a vaguely amusing dog video on YouTube? Tweet about the latest couple on Eastenders? Think of all the lives you could save by writing a simple letter. Just a letter, one letter. Remind the governments of the promises they made in 1948. It&apos;s time to pick up a pen and write for rights.",

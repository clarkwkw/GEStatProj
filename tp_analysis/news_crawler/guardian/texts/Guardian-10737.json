    "text": "From the history of red phone boxes to the sexualisation of women in magazines  there&apos;s no subject that can&apos;t be covered in a short film, according to students at Newcastle University. Finalists at the School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics have taken up the Guardian and Oxford University Press (OUP) challenge: create a 60-second film which informs, entertains and engages. The reward? A 9,000 prize for the most impressive piece. Tina Gharavi, a filmaker who also lectures at the university, is using the competition to structure her teaching: &quot;Short films are a chance for students to examine a slice of life  by showing an audience something new and by being visually creative.&quot; Students Adam and Isabelle are making a film on superstitions  they want to find out where superstitions come from and whether they are losing their grip on today&apos;s more cynical society. &quot;Our documentary will set out a brief history of superstitions and what it means to be superstitious today. We want to explore why people were superstitious. Is it because people want to find a kind of causality or meaning in events, or is it a genuine fear of consequence?&quot; Gharavi says the hardest thing about making a short film is knowing how to use your time effectively: &quot;You need to hit the ground running with a subject  but you also need to have enough runway so that you can take off and land, all in a very short space of time.&quot; So how can you get started? &quot;Begin with a question  think about what it is that you want to teach your audience.&quot; The Very Short Film Competition is inspired by OUP&apos;s Very Short Introduction series  just as the OUP books provide a snappy and comprehensive guide to new subjects, students should use their film to present complex ideas in a creative way. The best clips will fire up people&apos;s understanding and enthusiasm. Informative films aren&apos;t all about talking heads and monologue speeches, says Gharavi. &quot;There are lots of ways you can use film to inform your reader, from props to animation. If a voiceover is necessary  and it probably is for this competition  you might like to add it after filming. That way, you&apos;ll know that the visuals stand alone.&quot; Most importantly, the availability of free software, and the fact that most students now own camera phones, means anyone can have a go. &quot;You don&apos;t need fancy equipment to make a film  if anything, it&apos;s just a distraction. All you need is passion.&quot; It&apos;s not too late to enter, all full-time students are eligible, and you don&apos;t need to be a budding Spielberg. So get filming, and you could find you don&apos;t have to worry about tuition fees next year.",

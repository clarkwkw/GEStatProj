Click here to view Known for his early work at LucasArts, especially The Secret Of Monkey Island and its sequel, Ron Gilbert is a man who clearly loves puzzles, especially when they can be solved using a chimp. So we have The Cave. Choosing a team of three from a motley lineup of seven potential spelunkers, including a time traveller, hillbilly, scientist, monk and spooky twins, you take to the subterranean void accompanied by an amusingly apropos and self-referential commentary from the cave itself. Puzzles are frequently of the lever-pulling variety, but are at their finest when encountering each adventurer&apos;s personal underground goal. Some tasks have a ring of wearying familiarity about them, but most are novel and the underlying dark humour is a delight throughout, gently urging you towards your goal and an inevitable second play through to check out what gimmicks you missed.",

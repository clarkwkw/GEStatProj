    "text": "May I reassure Michele Hanson (A Certain Age, G2, 25 September) that, on the importance of music, she and I are singing from the same hymn sheet? This government has strengthened music in schools  protecting core music funding of 80m, introducing a music module for trainee primary school teachers, creating a new qualified music educator qualification and opening 123 new music education hubs, across all local authorities. As the chief executive of Arts CouncilEngland, Alan Davey, has said, these hubs will play a key role in ensuring that every child in the country has the chance to experience the richness of music. We are protecting the Music and Dance scheme for the most talented pupils and expanding the highly successful In Harmony scheme in the poorest areas. Based on the inspirational El Sistema programme in Venezuela, In Harmony provides intensive instrumental trainingto children from deprived backgrounds, teaching them to play in ensembles and orchestras. Our National Music Plan gives all young people the opportunity to learnamusical instrument for at least aterm, to sing regularly in choirs and vocalgroups, and to play in ensembles and perform. It is simply unfair that, for so long, the joy of music was the preserve of those whose parents could afford it. Under this government every child, regardless of background, will have an equal opportunity to discover music as an essential element of a rounded education, and a vital part of life.Michael Gove MPSecretary of state for Education",

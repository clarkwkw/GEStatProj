    "text": "A raindrop hangs at the tip of a rosehip, and in the moment before it falls an entire story has been reflected, upside down, inside it. The specs you lost have been put on the chainlink fence between Windmill Hill and Shadwell Quarry. They are misted up and rain-splattered. As I put them in my pocket, I realise the ones I&apos;m wearing are the same  I can barely see out of them. Across the field at the wood&apos;s edge, it feels more like night than late afternoon. The rain has reached a settled pace  not torrential but persistent  and, after what feels like a week of it, the land is a soggy, slopping, runneling muck. Cloud has sealed along the Edge and the sounds of traffic and birds fall loosely about inside its grey bag. There is no focus, no visible boundary. Along a narrow path between bramble, briar and thorn, each berry bears a raindrop, and in the shuffling fog I know I&apos;m not alone. There are a thousand stories reflected in these drops. A thrum of wings reveals a small charm of goldfinches foraging through the tangle, strangely colourless as if their lights have gone out. Apart from wing against briar, the redwings make hardly a sound except for a faintly hissing whisper. They have come from Scandinavia for these red berries and, unlike days of fair weather when they&apos;re a burst of energy, here they are furtive and conspiratorial. Suddenly, in the wet greyness, there&apos;s a flare of russet kicked up as brightly as a flurry of beech leaves. A woodcock, probing muddy grass, rockets through branches of the old boundary ash tree and off into the murk without a sound. It may be a native bird moving west or it may have flown in from Germany. On the electric wires, a pair of crows perch a couple of yards from each other: black and semi-detached, staring into the rain. They&apos;re both watching something inside the rain, looking out, that I can&apos;t see outside the rain looking in. The rosehip raindrop stories play out before plopping into the mud.",

    "text": "The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is calling for a fourfold increase in funding to help an estimated 320,000 people displaced by fighting and insecurity in northern Mali. UNHCR says it now needs $153.7m (99.9m), up from the $35.6m estimate it made in February. Since then, the situation in Mali has dramatically deteriorated  the country&apos;s civilian government was overthrown in a military coup in March and all territory north of Mopti has fallen into the hands of armed groups. There have been reports of numerous human rights abuses as these groups vie for control  around 165,000 people have fled their homes and are displaced in northern Mali; similar numbers have sought refuge in neighbouring Burkina Faso, Niger and Mauritania. &quot;The sharp degeneration of the situation in Mali, which has led to the flight and continued forced displacement of a huge number of Malians in such a short time, is totally unexpected,&quot; says Liz Ahua, UNHCR&apos;s deputy director for west Africa, central Africa and the Great Lakes region. Mali lies in the Sahel belt, a region facing a severe food crisis following poor and erratic rains last year. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) at least 3.5 million Malians are affected by food shortages and could be facing malnutrition. However, information about the situation in the north is hard to come by and it seems little assistance is getting through to communities. Government authority has effectively collapsed in the north, with local journalists reporting that most southern officials have left. Two main groups have emerged  the Tuareg rebel group MNLA and Ansar Dine, an Islamist group, which is calling for sharia law across the north  but neither of them can claim to have complete control over former government institutions. The militant group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is also thought to be active in the area (according to US diplomatic sources), and the areas controlled by all groups seem to be changing from day to day. All this makes it incredibly difficult for aid agencies to get accurate information and access. The main road from Bamako to Gao is not secure, and UN flights are only going as far as Mopti. Several foreigners have been kidnapped in Timbuktu, and seven Algerian consular staff were taken in Gao and later released. &quot;There are many armed groups in northern Mali without clear leadership,&quot; says Sarah Cotton from ICRC, which has been able to distribute fuel in Gao and Timbuktu to keep generators running. &quot;Security for humanitarian workers is a big challenge, and some of these groups have never worked with humanitarian organisations before.&quot; Local food markets have been badly affected by the insecurity in the north. ICRC estimates there has been a 40% increase in prices of grains compared with the same period last year, mostly because traders have not been able to move freely. The World Food Programme has begun food distribution across the south of the country, and is aiming to help 650,000 people nationwide. Blanket and targeted supplementary feeding, cash transfers and food for assets are to be launched at the beginning of June. However, their operations in the north remain small. Distributions have taken place in Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu, territories controlled by Ansar Dine around Gao. WFP staff are currently not allowed to travel to these areas. Twenty-nine metric tonnes of Plumpy&apos;Sup (a food supplement for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition) have been sent to Gao to assist 3,500 children facing malnutrition  this assistance is being given through Action Against Hunger, one of the few aid agencies still operating in the town. AAH staff say about 100 children are in hospital in Gao, and around 21% of children are suffering from severe malnutrition. AAH teams working in the region speak of the difficulties facing Gao, including the suspension of most services including health, education, electricity and water. Prices of rice and millet have doubled, with hardly any markets or shops open, and banks have closed. For now there seems no political solution to Mali&apos;s crisis in sight. An Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) plan to bring peacekeepers in and enact a transition to a new government has stalled, and Mali&apos;s interim president is still recovering after he was attacked in Bamako. Without an effective central authority there is very little hope of regaining the territory lost in the north, and aid agencies will be forced to deal with the myriad of opposing groups claiming authority. With the rainy season imminent, perhaps the best hope is that a better rainfall than last year could lead to a bumper harvest that can begin to replenish families&apos; depleted stocks.",

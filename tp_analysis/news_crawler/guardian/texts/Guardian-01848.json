    "text": "Twitter  a place to discover news, start revolutions, document history in real time and post thousands of tributes to an imaginary man, created by a comedian during a quiet moment. Showing that the Friday feeling was alive and well on Twitter, the imaginary death of the imaginary comic Gregg Jevin dominated the website&apos;s trends. It started innocuously enough, with the comedian Michael Legge posting a tweet that read: &quot;Sad to say that Gregg Jevin, a man I just made up, has died. #RIPGreggJevin.&quot; Before long, a flurry of tributes were pouring in, pushing #RIPGreggJevin and Gregg Jevin to the top Twitter trends  no mean feat for a comedian with about 10,000 followers at the beginning of the day. Other comedians quickly got on board. @mrpetermore dwelt with regret on his troubled relationship with the imaginary comedian: &quot;I take back every mean-spirited, spiteful thing I ever said Gregg Jevin. Now he&apos;s dead. #RIPGreggJevin&quot;, adding: &quot;Don&apos;t know how I&apos;m going to break the news about Gregg Jevin to my kids. He was their role model as they are also made up.&quot; The trend  caused when there is a sudden spike in conversations around a hashtag  did create some confusion, leading one tweeter to comment: &quot;Loving all the people asking &apos;who is Gregg Jevin?&apos; But then, did any of us really know?&quot; Before long, tributes not only from individuals but also from major publications were being posted. The Radio Times was a vocal Gregg Jevin enthusiast. Tweeting as @RadioTimes, it announced a series of programmes dedicated to the made-up man. &quot;Schedule update: 9.30pm tonight on BBC2, the tribute programme &apos;Oh Well, Never Mind: The Gregg Jevin Story&apos;  It&apos;s part of Gregg Jevin Night, which includes his films Tears from a Face (1975), Warm Protocol (1981) and Elephant! (1986) #RIPGreggJevin&quot;. The Royal Albert Hall also made an announcement. &quot;Tickets for the Gregg Jevin memorial concert here are likely to go on sale in the coming weeks,&quot; it told the dead comedian&apos;s creator. There were showdowns, with @WstonesOxfordSt tweeting: &quot;Come on @Foyles. Let&apos;s fight tonight at 10, Oxford Circus. Do it for Gregg. #RIPGreggJevin.&quot; And there were newsflashes: &quot;Fictional character Gregg Jevin has died,&quot; tweeted @BBCWorld. Even Legge seemed surprised by the interest garnered by the imaginary comedian&apos;s passing. &quot;Interesting that Gregg is trending worldwide. I remember when Diana died. She didn&apos;t trend on Twitter at all,&quot; he wrote.",

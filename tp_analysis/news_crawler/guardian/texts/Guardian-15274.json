    "headline": "More light and less heat over energy supply", 
    "text": "Why is it necessary for those writing about the future UK energy situation like Michael Hanlon (Energy, not bribery, 2 May) to refer to &quot;the lights going out&quot;? The outcome is likely to be far less dramatic. It&apos;s quite correct that a great deal of old coal and nuclear capacity will be retired over the next few years. For the rest of this decade, that will be replaced by as much renewables as can be built (mostly wind) and gas. Most of the gas-fired power generation which is needed has already been built; around 4GW is currently not in operation because it is unprofitable and most of the rest is running at far lower load factors than in previous years. If &quot;the lights threaten to go out&quot;, existing gas-fired generation will run at higher load factors and more can quickly be built. Contrary to Mr Hanlon&apos;s assertion, this is unlikely to leave consumers &quot;at the mercy of Russia and Kazakhstan&quot; (neither of which supply the UK with any significant volumes of gas); but there will be increased dependence on Norway, Netherlands, Qatar and perhaps the US. Towards the end of the decade, the UK may produce some shale gas if drilling and fracking prove to be environmentally acceptable; the volumes will not be great and are unlikely to be &quot;cheap&quot; in comparison to imports. Post 2020, other carbon (with carbon capture and storage) and non-carbon generation options may become available, including increased production of shale gas. Outcomes will depend on costs, and costs will be affected by environmental acceptability and carbon pricing. The future of the UK power sector over the next decade has already been determined: wind and gas may not be the best possible option, but it is far from the worst, in relation to costs and carbon emissions. Apologies for the lack of apocalyptic or visionary sentiments about our future energy situation, but these are simply obscuring rather than illuminating the debate.Professor Jonathan Stern Chairman and senior research fellow, natural gas research programme, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies",

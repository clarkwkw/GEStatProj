    "text": "My acquisition of a tiny wood on the banks of the river Yare has allowed me to renew a transaction with nature that I haven&apos;t enjoyed for 40 years. Every time I visit I permit myself the guilt-free pleasure of a thick fistful of plants in flower as a bouquet for the house. Alas, we live in such an age of hands-off environmental anxiety and in a landscape of such intense environmental impoverishment that the practice of gathering wild flowers is now a lost paradise for most of us. Plantlife, the environmental charity devoted to our national flora, suggests that we now have more flower-rich roadside verge than we do wild flower meadows. Sadly the organisation counts its membership in thousands, while the Royal Horticultural Society numbers its own in hundreds of thousands. It says so much about our national culture: that plants sown, tended and owned by us are somehow so much more engaging than native blooms which spring up spontaneously without our leave. At this point of the season my wood is steeped in wild herbage and to clear a path of 50 metres through the rainforest of towering green takes hours of scything. In places the great hairy willowherb, in which the site is particularly rich, is way over my head. Yet it is the meadowsweet that is most wonderful. When first emerged the nascent flowers are pendulous drupes of tiny green &quot;berries&quot;. These steadily turn to a wedding-gown cream and finally they burst, each flower spreading with a dozen or so threads of yellow-ended sepals. In aggregate the millions of flowers form a cream haze across the horizon. No wonder it was once known as &quot;Queen of the Meadow&quot;. Some suggest that meadowsweet has a sickly smell, but Gerard in his herbal said &quot;it maketh the heart merrie&quot; and &quot;delighteth the senses&quot;. People once covered the bedchamber with meadowsweet as a kind of disposable carpet, and to induce dreams scented of marzipan and honey.",

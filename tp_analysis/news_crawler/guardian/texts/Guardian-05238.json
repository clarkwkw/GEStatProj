    "text": "The UK public&apos;s concern over genetically modified food has softened in the past decade, according to a new survey. A quarter of Britons are now unconcerned by GM food, compared with 17% nearly a decade ago, when supermarkets debated whether to introduce GM products following widespread public opposition and attacks on GM test fields in the 1990s. The number of people &quot;concerned&quot; about GM has also fallen by 5%, said the Populus survey, commissioned by the British Science Association and published on Friday. The poll comes as the EU prepares to vote on a Danish-led proposal to allow member states to ban the cultivation of GM crops on a country-by-country basis, with the UK concerned that the proposal will not achieve its aims.        Caroline Lucas, the Green MP and Green party leader, said: &quot;If the government or the agri-business lobby think that this industry-sponsored poll is a sign of wholesale public support for GM foods, then they are completely out of touch with reality. For decades, public opinion polls have consistently shown opposition to GM, not least because huge concerns remain about the environmental impact of this technology, the risks associated with cross-contamination for the future of non-GM food, and the dangers of placing ever more control of food production in the hands of big GM corporations. &quot;The issue may have gone off the boil since Tony Blair&apos;s failed attempts to persuade us to accept GM, but as soon as people get an inkling that it is back on the menu, no amount of industry lobbying or positive PR from the government will prevent resistance to genetically modified foods.&quot; Professor Joyce Tait, scientific adviser at the ESRC Innogen Centre, said of the survey: &quot;There seems to have been a move away from the extremes, to the middle ground, with answers often being categorised as &apos;don&apos;t know&apos;. That neutral ground seemed to happen across the board. I didn&apos;t see that as a challenge to do more public engagement, rather I saw that to mean that it was becoming less contentious.&quot; Four countries  Canada, the US, Brazil and Argentina  grow more than 90% of the world&apos;s GM crops, and more than 80% of the GM seeds sold each year are owned and sold by one company, Monsanto. GM acreage grew 8% globally last year, according to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agribiotic Applications, which is funded by GM companies including Monsanto, Bayer CropScience and CropLife International.",

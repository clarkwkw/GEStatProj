    "text": "As soon as I am in front of my computer in the morning, I have an urge to check Wikipedia regarding something I heard on the radio while I was still in bed. For a moment, I have to sit on my hands. Once the moment passes, I feel more confident. Even if I regularly use Wikipedia for research, this assignment is to write about not using it. Surely I won&apos;t need it for that. I&apos;m aware that Wikipedia is going dark to protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa)  I got a press release  but I know little about the act itself. If only there were some short, well-sourced article about it online, one that came top when I Googled ... It&apos;s astonishing how reliant on Wikipedia I&apos;ve become, both for work and as a way to waste time when I should be working. My browser history shows I&apos;ve consulted it 34 times in the last seven days, on subjects as diverse as Vincent Van Gogh, Blue Monday, flexicurity and Madonna. Over the past month I&apos;ve looked up eschatology, dog meat consumption, The Killing (I wondered if the Danish title, Forbrydelsen, actually meant &quot;The Killing&quot;; it doesn&apos;t), rubric, geomagnetic reversal and Little Mix. I treat the website as an extension of my brain: if I can get the information quickly enough, it&apos;s almost as if I knew it already. I&apos;ve been known to read my phone under the table while answering my children&apos;s questions about the solar system with total authority. Today, I will have to say, &quot;It&apos;s complicated&quot;, and leave the room. Questions are regularly raised about Wikipedia&apos;s reliability and bias, but it&apos;s a perfect starting point for any subject one knows nothing about, and I generally use it not so much to check facts as to cure a failure of imagination: one link leads to another, down trails of inquiry it would never occur to me to pursue otherwise. That can be the only reason I actually looked up &quot;wrinkle&quot; the other day. I&apos;d love to be able to say it&apos;s made me more intelligent, but the knowledge I glean from Wikipedia stays with me, on average, for about a week. I dimly recall that eschatology is &quot;the science of the last things&quot;, but three weeks after the fact I have no idea what vexillology is, or why I even cared. It&apos;s not in my dictionary. The real miracle of Wikipedia is that its user-friendliness corresponds exactly to the idleness of my curiosity. When any more effort is required to find something out, it usually turns out I didn&apos;t want to know that badly.",

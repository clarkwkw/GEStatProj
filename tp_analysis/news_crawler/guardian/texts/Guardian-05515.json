    "text": "In January, we helped app developer Taptu to create a new way for you to enjoy our green journalism: a free environment app for iPad and iPhone.  Many thousands of you downloaded that, and loved it, giving it 4.5 stars out of five. In most recent reviews, jacko136 says: &quot;Brilliant. Can&apos;t improve&quot; while SarahVL says: &quot;Strong design and content mean this news app satisfies both my desire to browse and dig deeper and spend time reading. Enjoyable to use.&quot; But some of you asked if there would be a version for Android. And now there is: you can download that Taptu Guardian Environment App on Google Play. We&apos;ve added some new streams too, including Al Gore&apos;s blog. Do let us know what you think of it, by rating the app on the site or posting a comment below - or both! The Android app was created in the same way as the iOS app. The app is built by Taptu and powered by the Guardian&apos;s content, through our Open Platform. What you get is a choice of story streams, such as climate change or wildlife, which you can tailor to your own tastes. Navigating is easy using the touch interface and you can share stories on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter with a tap of the finger, or save them for later with Instapaper, Read it Later or Taptu&apos;s bookmark stream. We have also included streams from some of our partners in the Guardian Environment Network, including Business Green, Yale Environment 360 and Mother Jones&apos;s green channel, as well as others such as Reuters environment news. That means you can get all the very best green news and comment from around the world in one place. So I hope you&apos;ll download it now and give it a go.",

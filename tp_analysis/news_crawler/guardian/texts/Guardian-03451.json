    "text": "David Cameron may avoid talking too openly of his tailcoat-wearing schooldays at Eton, but if the Conservative members of government want to avoid conjuring images of ruddy-cheeked prefects, brisk games of rugger and chapel before breakfast, they don&apos;t seem to be trying very hard. In a speech this week to Scottish voters before the local elections, the prime minister laid out the latest policy aspiration to be modelled explicitly on what he called the best of &quot;what independent schools had going for them&quot;. Pupils, he said, should &quot;stand up when their teacher walks in the room&quot;. He then catalogued  in a characteristically verbless paragraph  other attributes every school should acquire: &quot;Real discipline. Rigorous standards. Hard subjects. Sports where children can learn what it is to succeed and fail.&quot; Headteachers, he added, should &quot;captain their own ship&quot;. Last year Cameron was accused of behaving like Flashman  the arrogant cad of Thomas Hughes&apos;s Victorian public school romp Tom Brown&apos;s School Days  by Ed Miliband at an ill-tempered prime minister&apos;s questions. This week the PM, who has never quite shaken off the Flashman dig, might very easily have been channelling Tom&apos;s father, Squire Brown, who &quot;believed honestly that the powers which be were ordained of God and that loyalty and steadfast obedience were men&apos;s first duties&quot;. It is far from the first time the coalition, particularly its Tory segment, has explicitly called for a return to what some see as the stiff-backed, &quot;play the game&quot; values of top Victorian-era schools. The education secretary, Michael Gove, unveiling the government&apos;s plans for schools in November 2010, said Britain could become an &quot;aspiration nation&quot; if schools were urged to reintroduce uniforms  featuring traditional blazers and ties, rather than louche, modish sweatshirts  and the prefect and house systems that parents more commonly pay for their children to partake in. There being &quot;no profession more noble, no calling more vital, no vocation more admirable&quot; than teaching, he said, former soldiers, sailors and airmen would particularly be encouraged to take up the profession, adding: &quot;Unless order is maintained in the classroom, teachers cannot teach and children cannot learn.&quot; Gove, who like 59% of the original coalition government was educated privately (he was a scholarship boy at an independent school in Aberdeen), has since pledged to place a King James Bible in every school, and urged more &quot;unashamedly elitist&quot; institutions such as Cambridge University and major public schools to help run state schools. He has also sung the praises of a classical education in characteristically anti-populist tones: &quot;We should recover something of that Victorian earnestness which believed that an audience would be gripped more profoundly by a passionate, hour-long lecture from a gifted thinker which ranged over poetry and politics than by cheap sensation and easy pleasures.&quot; The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, may be in the cabinet minority as a grammar school boy from Yorkshire, but his self-consciously jolly catchphrase  &quot;Hello chums!&quot;  is straight out of Hughes&apos;s novel. Pickles has forcefully called for a return to a very particular brand of old-fashioned national traditions, which in his interpretation means &quot;British traditional Christian culture&quot;. &quot;A handful of activists,&quot; he has said, want to &quot;disown the traditions and heritage of the majority&quot;  including Christian worship at council meetings, the union flag and, presumably, the traditional British weekly bin collection. Winterval, the menacingly secular festival ousting Christmas across Britain, similarly &quot;deserves to be in the dustbin of history&quot;, he has said  overlooking the fact that even the Daily Mail has admitted that stories of Winterval renaming or replacing Christmas were untrue. But there has been criticism of the old-fashioned agenda  analysis last year by a coalition of female academics accused Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, of actively seeking to restore an &quot;old-fashioned model of family life&quot; in which men worked as sole breadwinners, and women stayed at home to raise the family. This may or may not be a model fondly remembered by Duncan Smith, but the Fawcett Society said the reforms &quot;risked turning back time on women&apos;s equality&quot;. The government denied it was seeking &quot;to incentivise &apos;traditional&apos; families only&quot;. And what is the &quot;big society&quot;, if not a politician&apos;s attempt to capture Tom Brown&apos;s team spirit? &quot;We&apos;ve more reliance on one another,&quot; says the book&apos;s hero, &quot;more of a house feeling, more fellowship than the school can have&quot;. In the schoolboy&apos;s case, this was a winning formula. The Tories will hope it can represent the same for them.",

    "text": "After the washout summer, this month&apos;s sunshine over much of the country has given flowers a new lease of life. Ivy is coming into bloom and, along with buddleia and other flowers rich in nectar, is giving butterflies and bees something to feast on after a wretched year. But the cool, wet spring and summer has delayed the season for berries on bramble, blackthorn, elder and other bushes, and these are only beginning to ripen. They also seem to be smaller than usual. However, the rains this year were excellent for trees, which put on lots of foliage. The rains have also helped to keep the leaves on the trees this autumn. The Woodland Trust&apos;s nature&apos;s calendar project is reporting far fewer signs of early leaf tints compared to last year, and is urging the public to send in reports of the changing leaf colours to naturescalendar.org.uk. The earliest leaf colours come out on trees such as wild cherry, which is now showing flecks of yellow, red and purple. As for most other trees, there is a thought that this autumn could see a blaze of colours if the warm sunshine and chilly nights continue. Sunshine helps the leaves make sugars, and cool nights help bottle up the sugar in the leaves. When the green leaf pigment dies off, that sugar is used for making orange and red pigments  the sort of brilliant autumn leaf colours that make sensational displays across Canada and New England.",

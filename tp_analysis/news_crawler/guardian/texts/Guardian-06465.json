    "text": "Some games gently quicken the passing of time, others loom and intimidate. Pro Cycling Manager&apos;s 2012 instalment manages both, facilitating lost hours of assiduous tweaking coupled with the foreboding that one false step, even before day seven of a second-tier stage race in Malaysia, could derail Bradley Wiggins&apos;s hopes of winning the Tour de France. Should you send the neo-pro time-triallist to a plush Mallorca training camp or billet a bunkbed in a musty barrack in northern France? Do you care? Chances are that if you&apos;ve got this far you do, and the scale of this game, with a database that covers 81 professional teams and their riders in extraordinary detail, makes this an appealing prospect to the obsessives in a cycling community that is swelling rapidly in the UK. There&apos;s some unrefined operating clunkiness that would not be found in the Football Manager titles, and occasional system instability, but the scale offered here is more than enough to compensate any pedal-pushers drawn to a challenge.",

    "text": "Rory Carroll is at the Consumer Electronics Show for the Guardian, taking notes and photos about the most talked-about products at the tech jamboree. Somewhere in between writing about brainwave technology and new wireless watches produced by Pebble, Rory found time to take a look around. A closer look at the watches, a Kickstarter creation:    #2013CES Pebble about to ship 85000 of these. A kickstarter fairytale. twitter.com/rorycarroll72/&mdash; Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) January 9, 2013    (The project launched on Kickstarter with a target of raising $100,000 in a month. Instead it became a phenomenon on the crowd-funding site, raising more than $10m.) Adventures in creative branding:    #2013CES In the old days we called them bags. twitter.com/rorycarroll72/&mdash; Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) January 9, 2013    (Related: &quot;CES has become a complete waste of time&quot;) Celebrity spotting: &quot;Does it make me a bad person to say I&apos;ve no idea who Snooki is?

Shoe phones? $29.99. twitter.com/rorycarroll72/&mdash; Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) January 9, 2013    The Snooki was never found, leaving products and rappers in her wake:    #2013CES seeking snooki I found 50 cent.

    "text": "As I hunker down in the garden to weed out bittercress, I hear the cry of a curlew, now returned to the fields above the valley. Around me in the semi-shaded border, lungworts are juddering in the March wind. Their fresh foliage has risen through last year&apos;s litter of rough crisp leaves. There&apos;s a sappy, cucumber smell when I accidentally break a stem, a reminder of this plant&apos;s similarity to comfrey. Like comfrey, lungwort is an important forage plant for bumblebees. Each inflorescence opens along an arc, the flowers changing colour as they mature from pink unopened buds to blue tubes. This gave rise to the country name of soldiers and sailors, one of the many local names for this old garden plant. The hairy leaves of lungwort vary widely in their markings; some are plain green, most are spotted pale green or grey, and some are almost entirely silver, as in the cultivar &apos;Excalibur&apos;. It is these spots that led to its common name as well as its botanical name of Pulmonaria, and in these two names its folk history can be heard. Early herbalists saw a resemblance between lungwort leaves and the mottling of a diseased lung. In the search for remedies, links were made between parts of the body and their likenesses in plants, known as the doctrine of signatures. Nearby in the border are other doctrine plants, their proximity a coincidence but unsurprising as they are all cottage garden plants. Honesty, with its silver seed pods that look like oval moons, was said to cure madness; madness was brought on by the full moon, and this is echoed in the genus name of Lunaria. I can also see the white tips of double bloodroot pushing through the leaf mould; they are on the verge of bursting into pristine, leafless flowers. And here in the shade is lesser celandine, yellow petals flared back to draw in sunlight, its bunches of tubers giving it the other name of pilewort. Each dislodged tuber makes a new plant, which is not appreciated by gardeners unless, like mine, they are the purple-leaved plants of &apos;Brazen Hussy&apos;.",

The cabinet member for finance at a North London council says local authorities are finding it difficult to find an &quot;affordable&quot; IT supplier to devise a system for the Government&apos;s new council tax benefit regime because they&apos;re pricing &quot;massive risk&quot; into their costs.  The Government is abolishing the current scheme where councils receive rebates on the financial support they provide. Instead, it has told them to come up with their own schemes from next April, cutting expenditure by 10% and handing them the money to administer it.  Toshiba Cancels Windows RT Devices on Delay in Getting Parts - Businessweek  Toshiba Corp cancelled previously announced plans to sell computer and tablet devices based on Microsoft&apos;s Windows RT operating system because of a delay in getting components.   Can&apos;t get enough ARM processors, apparently. RIM&apos;s first test: a preview with carriers &gt;&gt; WSJ.com  Research In Motion Ltd will start delivering nearly complete versions of its new smartphones to carriers next week--the start of a crucial effort to convince consumers and carriers alike that the BlackBerry can compete with the iPhone and Android devices.  RIM Chief Executive Thorsten Heins, in a briefing with The Wall Street Journal, said the company will show two &quot;beta&quot; versions of its new phones to carriers during the five-week roadshow. The meetings will test RIM&apos;s credibility as it tries to regain its footing in the global smartphone market.   Two phones initially, one all touchscreen, one with a keyboard. Eventually, there will be six phones: three touchscreen ones. The sentiment that comes out of carriers in the next few weeks will be telling. (Article may be paywalled.)  Joyent ending &quot;Lifetime&quot; hosting accounts. Some years ago... &gt;&gt;Ken McKinney on Google+  Some years ago when Joyent (then TexDrive) was young and strapped for cash they offered &quot;Lifetime&quot; hosting accounts apparently by &quot;lifetime&quot; they meant until we get tired of supporting them.......    Yes, those &quot;lifetime&quot; accounts are being closed. Presumably, the alternative was to kill the customers.

If you&apos;re stuck for a postcode to set up a fight, try SW1 1AA (Buckingham Palace) or N1 9GU (The Guardian). Stop Publishing Web Pages &gt;&gt; Anil Dash He means for content:   The vast majority of advertising online is dependent on a page-view model that users have overwhelmingly decided to abandon. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and others will succeed by making in-stream advertisements that fit in with the native content of their networks. Meanwhile, page-based sites are cramming every corner and bit of white space on their sites with ads that only ever decrease in effectiveness until they are made even larger and more intrusive every few years.  Why Apple bought AuthenTec: it needed NFC fingerprint sensors, quickly &gt;&gt; The Next Web  On July 27, seemingly out of nowhere, security company AuthenTec announced in a regulatory filing that it had agreed to a $356m acquisition offer from Apple, making it one of the Apple&apos;s biggest mergers in its 36 year history. Terms of the deal included provisions for the company&apos;s patents, control of its fingerprint sensors, touchchips and security technologies, but much of the detail was missing from AuthenTec&apos;s document at the time. However, with the recent filing of a PREM14A proxy statement with the SEC (a document which notifies shareholders of the deal and how it was finalised, allowing them to vote on whether it should be completed), the security firm has shed more light on why Apple decided to acquire the company.   Good spot by TNW (you have to love the SEC), and very intriguing. NFC? Fingerprint sensors? But not soon; this sort of technology will probably take some time to surface.  Asus UX32VD Zenbook Teardown &gt;&gt; iFixit  Today we tore apart the Zenbook UX32VD, Asus&apos; flagship Ultrabook. And the Zenbook lived up to its name, giving us very little frustration during deconstruction.  Even though it lost by a couple of millimeters in the slimness race against the MacBook Air, the Zenbook more than made up for it with stellar repairability. With an upgradeable RAM slot, swappable 2.5? hard drive, and a battery that can be easily replaced, the Zenbook earned an 8 out of 10 repairability score, easily trumping the soldered-RAM-and-proprietary-SSD MacBook Air&apos;s meagre 4 points.  webOS GBU to become quasi-independent cloud and UX company: meet GRAM &gt;&gt; webOS Nation  What&apos;s more interesting is the stated focus for Gram. Unsurprisingly, Gram is dropping any pretenses of producing consumer hardware. Instead the company is going to focus on software, user experience, the cloud, engineering, and partnering. If you&apos;re wondering exactly what that means, you&apos;re as in the dark as we are, though apparently webOS and Enyo, as well as the webOS group&apos;s own cloud services team (said to still be quite large with respect to the overall size of the unit), will play some sort of role.   It&apos;s hard not to feel that webOS has become some sort of sinecure for using up spare HP cash. There&apos;s simply no obvious demand for any of this stuff from an independent, tiny company; far better to license or sell the UI ideas from webOS to Google and/or Apple.

Acer just showed off its AcerCloud service, something that already sounded suspiciously like Apple&apos;s iCloud. Even the &quot;PicStream&quot; element sounds a lot like Photo Stream. Still not convinced? Acer basically ripped off Apple&apos;s slide wholesale, outside of the font, which is a simulacrum of Apple&apos;s font of yore. Check out both slides below.&quot; The slides are indeed a ripoff, though it&apos;s hard to argue that the idea of having a cloud storage system is unique to Apple. Although the key point here is that this isn&apos;t connected to Google, and it&apos;s like Apple&apos;s iCloud in that it abstracts the file system away - you have photos and you have documents. Microsoft, defying image, has a design gem in Windows Phone &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com Microsoft&apos;s team draw an interesting analogy with the plight of the hiker who got his arm trapped under the boulder and had to cut it off.

Motorola Mobility says Holiday quarter wasn&apos;t so jolly &gt;&gt; AllThingsD &quot;Motorola Mobility on Friday warned that fourth-quarter sales won&apos;t be what many were expecting. &quot;The cellphone maker said it estimates its sales totaled $3.4bn, and that it will post &apos;modest profitability&apos;, excluding various items. Motorola said it shipped about 10.5m mobile devices in the quarter, just over half of which were smartphones. &quot;While Motorola itself hadn&apos;t given a forecast for the quarter, analysts were expecting sales to be a lot closer to $3.9bn.&quot; Its last of four quarters as an independent company? (And: giving out mobile phone figures? How declasse.) Windows 8 Storage Spaces: pooling redundant disk space for all &gt;&gt; Ars Technica &quot;When Microsoft killed Windows Home Server&apos;s &quot;Drive Extender&quot; technology, we mourned its loss but held up hope that the company would persevere with the concept. The company has done just that with a new Windows 8 feature called Storage Spaces, described in a lengthy post to its Building Windows 8 blog. &quot;With Storage Spaces, physical disks are grouped together into pools, and pools are then carved up into spaces, which are formatted with a regular filesystem and are used day-to-day just like regular disks. &quot;Unlike RAID systems of old, but in common with other modern storage technologies such as Solaris&apos; ZFS and Linux&apos;s btrfs, pools can use disks of different interface technologies--USB, SATA, Serial Attached SCSI--and different, mismatched sizes. New disks can be added to a pool at any time. Pools can also include one or more hot spares: drives allocated to a pool but kept in standby until another disk in the pool fails, at which point they spring into life.&quot; That&apos;s very cool.

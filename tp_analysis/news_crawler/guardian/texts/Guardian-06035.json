    "text": "   Ruby Smith, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    Rio+20 is a unique and historic opportunity for world leaders to prioritise development and plan a better world for future generations. I would like to ask delegates to remember the importance of putting children at the forefront of decisions and plans made at Rio+20. The conference can change the lives of children living in poverty now, and improve the prospects for their futures immeasurably  but this will only happen if people speak up for children. Recent years have seen disasters that have caused untold damages to the health and wellbeing of children, with the drought in west Africa being the most recent example. In west Africa over 1 million children are at risk of severe malnutrition; this cannot continue. The world cannot see meaningful development until disasters like this are mitigated and eliminated to allow children to grow and thrive in safe and secure environments. The effects of climate change are disproportionately felt by those in developing countries, particularly children who are always among the most vulnerable in society. Because of this vulnerability, and because the children of west Africa and other parts of the developing world are unable to speak up for themselves, my message to Rio+20 is to speak up for children and to use every resource available to realise the dream of a safe world for them to grow in.

    "text": "On Tuesday, I&apos;ll be recording a video interview with Satish Kumar, the environmentalist who walked from India to the UK fifty years ago, and last week bought the 42-year old Ecologist magazine to incorporate it into his equally long-running Resurgence magazine. What questions do you want to ask Kumar? Post them below and I&apos;ll put them to him on your behalf.  Want to know where he will be taking the new magazine, now called Resurgence &amp; the Ecologist? Interested in his views on walking, and the role it plays in his life? Or do you want to quiz him on his solutions to wider ecological problems, such as cutting carbon emissions by slowing down?  We&apos;ll post the video as soon as possible.",

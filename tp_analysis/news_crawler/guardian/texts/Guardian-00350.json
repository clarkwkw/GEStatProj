    "text": "The president of Nigeria has joined politicians, environmental activists and others to pay tribute to Ken Wiwa, the Ogoni leader and critic of Shell and other western oil companies in the Niger delta, who has died from a stroke in London. Wiwa, the eldest son of Nigerian author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed in 1995 after leading a peaceful uprising by the Ogoni people to stop Shell from polluting their oil-rich area of the delta, was a journalist with the Guardian who later became an adviser to three Nigerian presidents. Wiwa was an ardent believer in the unity, progress and stability of his community. I urge family, friends and associates to honour his memory by making his dream of an environmentally safe, secured and prosperous Ogoniland a reality, said President Muhammadu Buhari.  As an aide to ex-presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umaru YarAdua and Goodluck Jonathan, Wiwa, 47, raised international awareness of the scale of devastation in the delta and helped secure international funding to clean it up.  Wiwa and the families of the other eight Ogoni leaders who were also executed by the Nigerian government in 1994, won $15.5m from Shell in 2009 as compensation for their deaths.  Last year, he wrote in the Guardian: If my father were alive today he would be dismayed that Ogoniland still looks like the devastated region that spurred him to action. There is little evidence to show that it sits on one of the worlds richest deposits of oil and gas. A 2011 UN report said Nigerias Ogoniland region could take 30 years to recover fully from the damage caused by 50 years of oil spills. The study said complete restoration could entail the worlds most wide-ranging and long-term oil clean-up. Goodluck Diigbo, president of Ogoni Central Indigenous Authority, said: The perspective of junior, as he was popularly addressed by the Ogoni, was that every problem and every conflict has a solution. This belief guarded his own quiet approach in tackling the dilemma of the Ogoni people. ",

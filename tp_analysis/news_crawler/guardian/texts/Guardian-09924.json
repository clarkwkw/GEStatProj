It has inspired a new form of poetry. And even those folks who lost power have found a way to make do.   Loren Brichter wrote Tweetie, which was one of the best third-party Twitter apps. Then Twitter bought it, and it was OK. Then Brichter left, and things got worse. Now he&apos;s coding again. How heavy are the latest smartphones? &gt;&gt; Pocket-lint  The British pound (GBP) coin weighs 9.5 grams and is something most of us have in our pocket. It can also help us to assess different weights easily, because you just add or take away coins.  For this quick, very unscientific test we&apos;ve gathered together the weights of the leading smartphones and then divided that number by 9.5. We told you it was simple.   Neat idea. Asustek: Nexus 7 Sales approaching 1 million a month &gt;&gt; WSJ Digits blog  Sales of Google&apos;s Nexus 7, made by Taiwan&apos;s Asustek Computer, are closing in on 1m units a month, the Taiwanese maker revealed.  The 7-inch tablet has created a big buzz this year with its low starting price of US$199, but both Google and Asustek have been cagey about revealing actual sales figures.  Asustek executives gave the clearest indication yet, following the company&apos;s third-quarter earnings conference on Tuesday.  &quot;At the beginning, it was, for instance, 500K units a month, then maybe 600, 700K. This latest month, it was close to 1 million,&quot; Asustek Chief Financial Officer David Chang told The Wall Street Journal.   So that&apos;s somewhere between 1.5 and 2m units shipped in the first three months. If Google&apos;s revenues suggested only 1m, what does that imply about the amount that it is getting per device - and the cost it has to make up? The Nexus 7 may be a great little device, but is there a sustainable business there? Right on Cue: can iTunes chief fix Apple&apos;s maps and Siri? &gt;&gt; CNET News  &quot;Eddy [Cue, the new head of services at Apple] doesn&apos;t care about those other guys, the flashy executives who want the spotlight,&quot; said an executive who has negotiated with Cue. &quot;He&apos;s the kind of person who is happy to be in the engine room making sure that everything is clicking along.&quot;  There&apos;s little doubt Jobs trusted Cue with big salvage jobs. Jobs turned over the foundering MobileMe online services to Cue in 2008 after the division launched to scores of glitches. In October 2011, MobileMe turned into iCloud. Apple said in July that the service now has 150 million users.   Incredibly, Cue joined Apple in 1989 in its IT department. He appears to have been there longer than any other senior executive. We need Apple and Google to work together again &gt;&gt; Read Write Jon Mitchell bemoans the Silicon Valley split which is doing neither company any benefits - nor their users:   Users are getting the short end of the stick on both sides of this Silicon Valley Stand-Off. Apple, Google, come on. It&apos;s not worth the effort to keep squabbling like this.  I want Google to invent the self-driving car, but I want Apple to design the car. How awesome would that be? But it&apos;ll never happen unless these companies get over their B.S. and start acting in their users&apos; best interests.  &apos;An iPad is not a device&apos; - Interview with Dave Gray &gt;&gt; Ruben van der Laan The stuff about the iPad isn&apos;t so important; this is about how companies work, or don&apos;t.   Ruben: But there&apos;s more than services in the world. We still need to manufacture products, so we also need those mechanistic jobs.  Dave: I&apos;m convinced that services will replace manufactured goods. In essence a manufactured good is a service, it has functionality and that&apos;s what you&apos;re buying it for. You&apos;re buying the product for its service. And increasingly manufacturers will make customized things. That&apos;s what we&apos;re heading for. You already see initiatives like Zip Car (car sharing company) where a single car is being used by about 15 families. Customers don&apos;t own cars anymore they buy the service a car provides.  Apple delays iTunes refresh until November &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  Here&apos;s a smaller bit of unexpected news: [Apple] is delaying the update of its iTunes software. Back in September, Apple said an iTunes overhaul would be out in October. Now it&apos;s pushing that back a month.  Here&apos;s spokesman Tom Neumayr&apos;s take: &quot;The new iTunes is taking longer than expected and we wanted to take a little extra time to get it right. We look forward to releasing this new version of iTunes with its dramatically simpler and cleaner interface and seamless integration with iCloud before the end of November.&quot;   To get rid of the skeuomorphisms? Sandy hits New York &gt;&gt; jalopnik.com  This amazing time lapse video shows Sandy&apos;s assault on New York and the moment the lights went out.  Uber kills surge pricing in NYC for customers, drivers paid 2X rate to meet post-Sandy demand &gt;&gt; TechCrunch  With the subway system down for the count in the wake of mega-storm Sandy, it&apos;s very, very tough to get around New York City today. And this morning, people who opened up their Uber apps to hail a car in Manhattan were met with another obstacle: &quot;Surge pricing&quot; which is when Uber hikes up fare prices during especially busy times. Now, Uber&apos;s surge pricing kicks into effect during especially high-traffic times when many people are looking to hail an Uber cab - times like holidays, and late nights after major sporting events. The idea is that even during times of high demand, if someone really needs a ride and is willing to pay, there will be a car available for them. The high pricing balances out the high demand. And while today in New York there is certainly an imbalance of supply and demand, many people thought that Uber deciding to turn on &quot;surge pricing&quot; while the city is working to collectively recover from the storm was distasteful. And they let Uber know - via Twitter, of course.   Ayn Rand never drove a taxi after a natural disaster in a large city. Theory, meet practice. Uber &quot;turned off&quot; surge pricing within the hour.  Building apps with rail data &gt;&gt; Guardian Datablog Great hackday report, which included people coding the answers to questions such as &quot;What is trains were on Foursquare?&quot; and &quot;what if travel planning showed the actual shape of the tracks, rather than straight lines?&quot; Wonderful. Voyager 1 detects weirdness at solar system edge &gt;&gt; Discovery News  Voyager 1 is the most distant human-made object and is thought to have recently escaped the sun&apos;s sphere of influence. The probe, launched 35 years ago, is therefore mankind&apos;s first interstellar vehicle careening into the vast expanse of space between the stars. Needless to say, as one of two deep space probes launched in 1977, Voyager 1 has explored previously unknown regions of the solar system, making groundbreaking discoveries as it went. Now, in a new paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, scientists analyzing data streaming from the spacecraft have uncovered a small mystery right at the solar system&apos;s magnetic boundary with the interstellar medium.   Ooo, mystery at the edge of the solar system. A sci-fi thriller. You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

    "text": "A friend found an old postcard in a box of curios at a rural sale and sent it to me. While it was posted in the 1950s, the design of the card and the image itself suggests that the hand-tinted photograph was taken many years before  perhaps in the 1920s. It shows a lane winding through hillside woodland, and a title in uneven script identifies it as being close to my home. In the middle distance, an anonymous figure in an overcoat sits looking down the lane. The road is not made up, and the soft surface carries the impression of a single vehicle  possibly that of the photographer. Intrigued, I setout to find the spot. The colours of Coed y Cwm  Cwm woods  have turned from spring to high summer in the month since I was last there. As I cut across the south side of the wood the deep deciduous canopy closed around me  bringing the urgent calls of blackbird and robin into sharp focus, together with the distant sound of tumbling water. Emerging into dappled sunlight, I saw how the ruderal species and the plants of the understorey were taking advantage of the bare ground where mature trees have been selectively thinned. At the meeting of two trails I turned north, dropping steeply towards the road along a track slippery from the overnight rain. The site of the photograph is still clearly recognisable, although the road is now metalled and marked with reflective posts to guide the unwary. The beech trees have matured and, although one is missing a major bough, are mostly still present. Thankfully, the rhododendrons are now in retreat  and I was pleased to track down exactly the spot where the photographer had paused to assemble his apparatus all those years ago. At the side of the road, a pair of stone gateposts provides a perfect sanctuary from traffic  although I was relieved to see that no one was seated in the middle distance.",

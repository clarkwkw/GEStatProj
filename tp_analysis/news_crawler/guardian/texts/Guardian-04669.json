    "headline": "Science Weekly podcast: David Eagleman on Sum, the opera", 
    "text": "On the podcast this week Ian Sample asks writer and neuroscientist David Eagleman how his book of short stories Sum came to be transformed into a chamber opera at the Royal Opera House in London.  David reveals that he turns to literature to explore the parts science can&apos;t reach, and discusses his belief that our increasing understanding of the brain is set to change how our legal system deals with criminals. Alok is joined by the assistant director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE), Beck Smith, to talk about its report on House of Lords reform. The report argues that with so few MPs with scientific expertise the role of scientists and doctors in the House of Lords is a vital one: any democratic reforms should ensure such experts continue to scrutinise legislation. Finally, Alok meets Charlotte Watts, professor of social and mathematical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, to discuss her research on violence and HIV. Charlotte talks about her journey from abstract maths to epidemiology and the growing importance of data-mining and statistics in tackling violence against women.

    "text": "Student journalists will get a chance to learn from industry experts next week, when they meet with editors of national papers to debate the future of journalism. A panel of editors, including John Witherow, editor of The Times, Sarah Baxter, editor of the Sunday Times Magazine, and Ian Katz, deputy editor of the Guardian, will meet 140 aspiring journalists to discuss the big challenges facing the industry  from paywalls to social media. Students will also debate the issues affecting journalism on their campuses, including the lack of funding available to university newspapers, student union censorship and apathy towards student politics. Students from the top 40 campus papers will attend, but an extra 15 places are also available to people interested in hearing the discussion. The talk will take place on Wednesday 17 April at the Frontline Club with the support of the Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies and Teach First. Students interested in attending should contact organisers via email: contact@grapevinevents.co.uk. Details can also be found on the Frontline Club website. Tickets cost 15.",

    "text": "Kid Icarus was last seen as a Mario-style platformer on the Gameboy 20 years ago, and while its original audience might since have become parents and homeowners, the game itself has grown into a frantic 3D shooter with unique stylus controls. Although &quot;grown&quot; maybe isn&apos;t the word. The tone is self-consciously adolescent, set by the gawpingly irreverent back-and-forth between winged hero Pit and his goddess patron-cum-flight control handler, Palutena. And you&apos;d be hard-pressed to call the controls an advance, the 3DS again wrestling with a lack of a second directional pad (unless you shell out for the Circle Pad Pro) and using the touchscreen for aiming. This works fine while Pit&apos;s in the air, but every level finishes on the ground, where swiping the screen to turn is teeth-grindingly inaccurate. Add to this the fact that these controls put such a strain on players&apos; left hands that the game comes packaged with a plastic stand and much of the bright, explosive promise of Kid Icarus is squandered.",

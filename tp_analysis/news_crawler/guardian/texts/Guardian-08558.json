    "text": "Very much like the sport on which it is based, Madden NFL 13 is both a game that takes itself seriously and isdevilishly intricate, which might make it as off-putting as the real thing to many gamers. Crammed on to the disc are numerous game types, managerial and player career options, and online modes. It is bewildering at first, especially considering that the core game doesn&apos;t shy away from aping the strategic complexity of its source material, and rarely panders to players who don&apos;t have at least a reasonable understanding of the rules of gridiron. And yet, behind the statistics and jargon lies a remarkably instinctive sports simulation. Madden NFL 13 isn&apos;t easy to master, but for those who know the difference between a playbook, a snap and a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;, it will likely be simple to pick up. Its greatest strength, however, is in capturing a sense of the physicality of American football  no easy task for a virtual medium. Vindicated in mirroring reality so closely, the latest Madden console outing may just the slickest yet.",

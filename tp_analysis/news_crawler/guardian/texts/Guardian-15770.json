    "text": "Energy secretary Ed Davey is right to warn of the massive gamble we&apos;ll be taking with the future of our planet if we fail to tackle climate change (Planned energy bill &apos;will destroy green benefits of HS2&apos;, 3 June). This is why MPs must support amendments to the energy bill today to decarbonise the power sector by 2030. It would give confidence to investors who want to create jobs by developing our huge clean energy potential, wean the nation of its reliance on increasingly expensive fossil fuels and put the UK at the forefront of the battle to tackle climate change. More than 300 MPs from all parties  and the leadership of the Labour party  have pledged to vote for decarbonisation. But the votes of Liberal Democrats are likely to be critical. With their green credentials hanging in the balance, will Liberal Democrat MPs back a safe, clean energy future  or support George Osborne&apos;s reckless dash for gas?Andrew PendletonHead of campaigns, Friends of the Earth",

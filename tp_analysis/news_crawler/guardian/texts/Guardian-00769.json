Members of our network connect to share experiences, seek out resources, ask questions and learn from each other. Project Dirt is a springboard for people and their green projects, and a facilitator for organisations and nice companies. We are less about talk and are more about doing things. Our vision is to make &quot;being green easy and fun&quot;. If this sounds like you, please click here to join up today. And if you know of a good Grassroots project, why not encourage them to share what they are doing by creating a project profile.",

    "text": "On Tuesday a group of scientists published a protocol, a set of instructions for running an experiment, which represents the culmination of a year&apos;s discussion on the problems inherent in academic publishing. The protocol is the first in the Registered Replication Reports project. The scheme, led by Alex Holcombe, Bobbie Spellman and Daniel Simons, is far reaching, and requires putting aside egos and working together across universities and research groups to raise the standard of research.  I and others have written about this before, but the gist of the problem is that the academic publishing system is currently set up to encourage novel exciting findings, which is somewhat contrary to the way scientific research works. While novel findings are interesting, it&apos;s cumulative converging evidence from a variety of different sources that provides us with scientific findings we can more readily say are evidence of true effects. The Registered Replication Reports project calls on research groups to separately conduct the same experiment, replicating a previously published study design exactly. All replications, regardless of result, will then be published together, providing an unbiased estimate of the true effect size, and the likelihood that the original finding was due to chance, or a real effect. I should be clear here that if a number of replications fail to support the original effect, this in no way suggests the original paper is fraudulent. Pete Etchells has written a great piece about the many reasons why initial findings may not be replicated. Due to the nature of statistics, one finding by itself is not definitive evidence of a real effect. Statistical science, in psychology or any other field, relies on testing a randomly selected sample from an underlying population, and estimating the effect in the whole population from that. Each sample you select will be a slightly different snapshot of the whole population, so each time you run an experiment, you&apos;ll get slightly different results. If you run an experiment only once, you may by chance get results at one end of the spectrum of &quot;possible results&quot;, which will make your effect size look huge. These types of studies are more likely to get published than ones where you by chance get a sample at the other end of the spectrum, and don&apos;t see any effect. This compounds the problem of untrue or exaggerated findings contaminating the literature. The first protocol published is an attempt to replicate a verbal overshadowing effect, first published in 1990 by Schooler and Engstler-Schooler. Schooler himself was involved in developing the replication protocol, which is a really positive sign. This isn&apos;t about ruining careers or shaming researchers, but about creating a literature that we can really believe. Schooler&apos;s original paper suggested that verbally describing a visual memory could create a biased version of the memory, which could interfere with the original, visual, memory. This finding came contrary to the previously held belief that rehearsing memories would make them stronger, not weaker. Since the study was published, there have been very few published direct replications of it, and when Schooler himself tried to replicate it he found much smaller effect sizes than in the original paper.  The implications of this study have real-world importance; consider eyewitness testimony. Schooler&apos;s findings suggest that asking witnesses to describe what they saw might actually make their memories of an incident less reliable. By getting a number of research groups to conduct multiple direct replications of the original study, a clearer picture can be found. The different groups&apos; replications can be pooled together to give a much more realistic estimate of the true effect size than any individual study could alone. Replication is something that has been suggested as important for years, so what has led psychologists to believe the Registered Replication Report project in particular will bring about the improvements so desperately required? Rather pleasingly, and perhaps surprisingly, it&apos;s due to the backing and encouragement of an established journal and publisher. All protocols will be online and collected findings will be published in Perspectives on Psychological Science, published by the Association for Psychological Science; one of the biggest publishers of psychological research. The journal itself has good form, having previously published a special issue on replicability in psychological science. This means anyone who undertakes the effort of following a protocol and replicating a study is guaranteed authorship on a paper in a respected journal, which is exactly the motivation needed. It is important not to underestimate the amount of work a replication involves. It&apos;s no trivial matter to run an experiment, and the reason replications are rare at present is because they are selected against at publication. Why do an experiment someone else has done, when it&apos;s less likely to get published, when you can be getting on with something novel, which could land you a &quot;better&quot; publication? A journal which guarantees that all findings, whether confirmatory or in disagreement with the original study, will be published just the same is a huge step forward. I think Tuesday&apos;s protocol publication is real progress from the field of psychology. Although publication bias, lack of replication and other such problems are likely to occur in any field of science where novel findings are selected for, it is psychology that has suffered public shame about the issue. But this means it is psychologists leading the movement to do something about it, and that makes me proud.",

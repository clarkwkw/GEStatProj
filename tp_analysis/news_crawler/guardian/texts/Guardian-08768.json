    "headline": "Samsung SSD 840 benchmarked as solid state drive prices plummet", 
    "text": "Guess what proportion of the 370m or so PCs shipped this year will include an SSD (solid state device, or NAND Flash drive, if you prefer)? According to Samsung&apos;s senior team in its SSD division, the figure is between 5% and 10%. Next year, they expect it to hit 20%  and by 2016 to reach 50%. For anyone who has experienced the speed and silence that SSDs bring, that has to be a good thing. With SSD manufacturing capacity growing rapidly, HDDs  hard disk drives with rotating platters  are starting to be less competitive. Prices for SSDs are now below the magic &quot;$1 per GB&quot; level, at which price sensitivity drops away: you can now buy a 512GB SSD for less than $500 (and about 400 in the UK), which means that you can give an old PC an entirely new lease of speeded-up life by copying the data onto the new drive. And that is the market that Samsung is going after with the latest generation of its SSD range, the Samsung Pro 840  following last year&apos;s 830 range. When the drive goes on sale in October, it will be targeted at users looking to update their machine rather than going to the expense of buying a new one. &quot;There&apos;s not a lot of money around in Europe,&quot; one Samsung manager told me, explaining why the company is presently going after the upgrade market  which is of course enormous, given the installed based of hundreds of millions of PCs. The forecast is that the number of SSDs bought for the &quot;aftermarket&quot;, as it&apos;s called, will roughly treble or quadruple this year and next. I&apos;ve had the chance to try out the Samsung 840 drive and to benchmark it. In the graphic below, which was first used for a group SSD test in January, it&apos;s been added as the last  and, as it turns out, usually longest  line in each group. (Longer is better: the figure represents the speed at which data is moved.)      SSD group test: Samsung, Crucial, Toshiba, Kiingston SSDs, and Maxtor HDD. Longer bars are better.    What the benchmarks show is that the 840 beats everything else, in most cases pretty handily, except in the &quot;random 4K write&quot; test. (And that might have been a one-off artefact of the test.) The benchmark, carried out by XBench, doesn&apos;t particularly torture the drive, but it&apos;s a good enough facsimile of real life.  The key message is that SSDs are now affordable, as has been becoming clear. Samsung, as the world&apos;s biggest memory maker, is making aggressive moves here  it&apos;s aiming to be the biggest in various markets (it&apos;s already second, it says, in the UK) and could drive down the price so that 1TB of SSD storage for your main machine is just an afterthought. One area though where SSD doesn&apos;t quite match up: use in high-end workstations, especially those used in work such as architecture which use colossal temporary files. SSDs perform poorly if they&apos;re used for repeated writing (because while it&apos;s extremely fast to read from them, writing requires the erasure of the memory location followed by the writing of the new data  unlike magnetic HDDs which simply write without erasing first). It may be a little time, executives admit, before they&apos;re quite ready for that sort of punishing environment  although the SSD 840 Pro range are touted as being for &quot;24-hour&quot; use. And what about the suggestions that SSDs fail catastrophically when they reach the end of their lives? That&apos;s not such a problem as it appears to be, says another Samsung executive. &quot;When you see the first few errors occur, you still have all the rest of the data there on the drive  you&apos;ve only lost a little bit where it went wrong. But when a HDD dies, everything is lost.&quot; The latter might not be quite true, but SSDs are improving not only in speed but also in longevity  the idea that they&apos;re only good for a short life is now long past. Samsung is offering a five-year warranty on its SSDs  and by the time you reach the end of the warranty, any replacement drive with the same capacity is probably going to cost around one-sixteenth, or 6%, of what you paid originally. So that means that that 512GB drive will cost about 24.      Samsung SSD 830 (2011) v SSD 840 Pro (2012) benchmark comparison. Longer bars are better.    If companies are able to get the same sort of speed improvements that Samsung is showing here year on year, then it will also be dozens of times faster. In fact Samsung&apos;s engineers are already saying that the SATA interface isn&apos;t sufficient for future SSD; it&apos;s limited to 6 gigabits per second, which apparently isn&apos;t enough for the hardcore SSD makers  who are now looking to PCIe because it offers parallel throughput and is already an industry standard.     Maxtor HDD v Samsung SSD 840 benchmark comparison. Longer bars are better.    One final word for those sitting with a computer using a spinning drive: look at the difference that an SSD can make. Below is the graph showing the relative difference between a Maxtor HDD and the Samsung 840.      Maxtor HDD v Samsung SSD 840. Bars show relative speed increase of SSD.    You&apos;ll notice that when it comes to reading data (as typically happens during startup) it&apos;s up to 20 times faster. That means an operation  such as booting up  that would take 60 seconds with the HDD will take 3 seconds with the SSD. When you multiply those sorts of benefits across a day, the time saved  or added  is colossal. We keep saying it, but that&apos;s because it&apos;s true: SSDs are the future of computer storage. It&apos;s just a question of whether you get on board now or when you buy your next computer  in 2016, perhaps.

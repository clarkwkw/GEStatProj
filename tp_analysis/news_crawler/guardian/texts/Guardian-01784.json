    "text": "Beyond the frost-tipped heather on an open heath, four blackbirds held to a dawn truce. Hostilities had been suspended under a small pine copse where the ground was still unfrozen. Each normally belligerent blackbird pecked away, ramming his beak into the soil, tossing it aside, studiously indifferent to his neighbour. Such was their concentration that it was not until I was directly under the trees that three of the males scattered, offering torrents of clucking abuse. The fourth held firm, feet planted apart on the earth,head slightly cocked. Maybe this was the resident, assured in the knowledge that humans did not stray from the path at this point. I ducked under the lowest branch of a pine and my attention was distracted by a twittering above. The high notes of a goldcrest were familiar enough, but there was a barely audible underlying song, a gossip&apos;s whisper that would have passed undetected had the singer not been within touching distance. I watched the goldcrest, skimming over the needles by my head as if it were vacuuming them. This was not a bird but a pompom, rounded like a wren, but without the flourish of a cocked tail. Usually, observers home in on the yellow streak on the crown of Britain&apos;s smallest bird, but that was hardly visible from below, so other details came into focus  the fine, disproportionately long beak, mousy grey plumage and light-rimmed, currant-black eye. It dipped and dabbed at the needles, a little ball weighing no more than a 10-pence piece, searching for food that was almost invisible to the human eye. The bird flicked up and round the back of another branch out of sight. A series of peeps punctuated its path higher into the canopy. This was the sound that I knew best, but I treasure that brief moment of rare intimacy and enlightenment.",

His book is a kind of lament for the company, which he says has become listless, bureaucratic and afraid to compete. He has harsh words for CEO Steve Ballmer and even for Microsoft founder Bill Gates, writing that Gates &quot;miserably failed in guiding the company through the Internet and social network revolution,&quot; and that &quot;perhaps the company would have been better off if Bill would have left earlier rather than tangentially spending his time saving his legacy and subsequently missing waves of opportunities!&quot; Recently I interviewed Kempin. Here are some highlights from our conversation.  Punches: not pulled. Samsung&apos;s David Eun: ongoing Apple v. Samsung litigation &apos;a loss&apos; for innovation &gt;&gt; Engadget  Breaking from discussions on Eun&apos;s view of Samsung as a content company, Swisher asked Eun quite pointedly about its relationship with Apple. Eun chuckled a bit, making quite clear that he himself was not the whole of Samsung. While Eun wouldn&apos;t comment on the specifics of the ongoing litigation, he did note that as a evangelist of Silicon Valley and a consumer of technology, he views the deadlock as &quot;a loss.&quot; It was actually a pretty candid response, and it was clear from his body language that he truly is less than thrilled that the legal struggles are ongoing. As Eun noted, Samsung makes money each time an iPhone is sold, yet the two companies are indeed competitors on some levels.  (Thanks @sputnikkers for the link.)

Apple Maps blamed for inaccuracies in CFA FireReady Bushfire app &gt;&gt; Sydney Morning Herald  ;The Country Fire Authority in Victoria has blamed Apple for reportedly dangerous deficiencies in the maps on its FireReady bushfire information app for iPhone and iPad. The FireReady app was forced to use Apple Maps, CFA said, but the maps were inaccurate and &quot;Macedon and a number of other Victorian towns are located incorrectly&quot;. This makes it very difficult to quickly determine the exact location of fires once alarm calls are being received. &quot;Users report that towns are located on their maps at the centre of the district rather than on the actual township itself,&quot; a CFA spokesman said.  The exact same problem - misreading the district&apos;s geocentre as the town name - that caused the previous Australian Apple Maps screwup. You&apos;d have thought someone at Apple might have worked through the Australian Gazetteer with a regex and fixed that by now. (Thanks @mopoke on Twitter for the link.) Yours vs. Mine &gt;&gt; Dustin Curtis  A question that inevitably comes up very early in the process of designing a new app is this: should the interface refer to the user as &quot;your&quot; or &quot;my&quot; when talking about the user&apos;s stuff, like in &quot;my profile&quot; or &quot;your settings&quot;? For a long time, this question ate at my soul. Which is right?  Well? Home Depot abandoning BlackBerry platform in favour of Apple&apos;s iPhone and iOS &gt;&gt; AppleInsider  People familiar with the big-box retailer&apos;s plans said the company has already begun the process of abandoning the Blackberry platform for Apple&apos;s iOS, specifically for store managers and all corporate level employees. A representative for the home improvement chain confirmed the news to AppleInsider, saying the move will displace roughly 10,000 Blackberry smartphones. The initiative will not yet impact the approximately 60,000 rugged Motorola smartphones (34,000+ so-called &quot;First Phones&quot; and 25,000+ &quot;First Phone Jrs&quot;) used by store employees. Those devices will remain in operation on retail store floors for mobile point-of-sale, analytical, walkie-talkie, and traditional telephony purposes.  Subsequently checked and confirmed by Reuters. Home Depot (the world&apos;s fifth largest retailer by revenue) wouldn&apos;t say if this move preceded or postdated the release of BB10 - though the former seems likely.

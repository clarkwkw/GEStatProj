    "text": "Marissa Mayer: she&apos;s got style. First she buys Tumblr - which, OK, is one of those Big Corporate Acquisitions that gets everyone het up (if they&apos;re on Tumblr) or analysing the cash flow (if they&apos;re on Wall Street). But Mayer? She took to Twitter, and to Tumblr, and - as was observed - may have become the first person to announce an acquisition with an animated GIF. To wit:  We also liked the fact that she took to Twitter (where she has a mere 330,000 followers - come on, Marissa, try harder) in order to announce the acquisition of Tumblr on her own Tumblr (natch), the faintly puzzlingly titled marissamayr.tumblr.com. The obvious question: what happened to the &quot;e&quot; in her surname? &quot;Hmm - marissamayer is also me but because of Tumblr/Flickr I thought I should be marissamayr.tumblr.com&quot;, she explained. (It&apos;s true that there&apos;s a http://marissamayer.tumblr.com/, but it&apos;s empty so far.)  Oh, and the other thing? Mayer deleted the Google+ link in her Twitter bio and replaced it with a Tumblr one (natch). Oh my, it&apos;s an exodus. And then it gets even better: she put up a second post on her Tumblr titled &quot;great workplace dilemmas of our time&quot; - referring neatly both to her own reputation for having instituted a &quot;no more working from home&quot; rule, and Tumblr&apos;s for its &quot;the internet is for porn&quot; approach. Let&apos;s hope she doesn&apos;t get too distracted posting to remember to actually run the company.",

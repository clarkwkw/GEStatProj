NAVE is a sort of bullet hell derivative, where your craft gets larger and larger throughout each stage and your goal is just to survive as long as possible. Sort of Super Hexagon meets DonPachi.  Intriguingly, the game is only available as a coin-up, which is now touring though Argentina. However, the developers have plans to ship it out to video game exhibitions around the world.

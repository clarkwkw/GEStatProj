    "text": "G8 leaders gather in Lough Erne next month for the first UK-hosted summit since the 2005 Gleneagles meeting  when commitments (pdf) to double aid to Africa by 2010, scrap unaffordable debt and spend 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development assistance were made. What&apos;s happened since? How have development debates changed? What&apos;s at stake for developing countries at this year&apos;s summit, with tax, trade and transparency on the agenda? The Guardian&apos;s Hugh Muir chairs the discussion in front of an audience at Kings Place in London, with the Guardian&apos;s economics editor Larry Elliott, chief executive of Save the Children UK, Justin Forsyth, co-ordinator of the Trade Justice Movement Ruth Bergan, and executive director of ONE, Jamie Drummond, on the panel.

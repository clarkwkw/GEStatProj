    "text": "Its been another turbulent month in the long-running saga over the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Having looked as if she might be contemplating a rethink, Theresa May unveiled an apparently decisive approval just before the Conservative Party conference. But with longstanding issues still unaddressed  and new problems emerging even since the PMs announcement  the debate over Hinkley is far from over. Now might be a good moment, then, to reflect on the contribution that social science can make to these kinds of controversies over science and technology. Of course, what counts as useful in any given controversy will depend on your perspective. It is inherent to democracy that different values and interests yield contrasting conclusions. This is especially so over deeply-fractured faultlines like those which run through the UKs commitments to nuclear power. Social science can provide a better understanding of why different perspectives disagree  and help (when possible) to identify common ground. Hard-pressed policymakers often find it useful to understand how to foster trust, confidence and acceptance of their institutions and procedures. For powerful interests in any setting, social research can also play a useful role in helping to justify, present or implement favoured policies. Here, social science can be part of the closing down of debate  helpfully enabling political attention to move on. But what if, on deeper reflection, powerfully-backed policies are a bad idea (perhaps as with the Hinkley decision? History is replete with examples  like asbestos, heavy metals, carcinogenic pesticides, chlorine bleaches, toxic solvents and ozone depleting chemicals  where it only emerged in retrospect that the pictures being given of sound science or the evidence base at the time were unduly shaped by vested interests or constrained imaginations. It is here that social science can play a further crucial role: helping to open up policy debates where they are being prematurely locked-in. This focuses less on society as a target for policymaking, and more on the processes of policymaking themselves. The production and interpretation of evidence is, after all, as much a social phenomenon as public attitudes or political mobilisation. It is a striking feature of the Hinkley example that even the governments own evidence base is strikingly damning. The assessment of value for money itself acknowledges Hinkley C to be more expensive than other low carbon energy strategies. And the picture in other official sources is even more negative. With nuclear costs rising and renewable costs falling  and a worldwide turn towards wind and solar power  global trends compound the picture. With the UK enjoying the best renewable energy resource in Europe and holding a competitive advantage in offshore industries, industrial policy arguments are also manifestly stronger for renewables. The same applies to prospective jobs. Compared to nuclear safety and security challenges, renewables are less vulnerable. And simplistic baseload arguments are shown by numerous official reports to be superseded by technology  and repudiated even by the National Grid. So the officially-stated reasons for nuclear enthusiasm simply dont stack up. The contrast with Germany is especially strong. Here, arguably the worlds most successful industrial power had a nuclear sector far larger and more successful than that of the UK, and a much less attractive renewable resource. Yet it is Germany  with a record of far-sighted industrial policy decisions in the past  that has made the opposite move to the UK: an Energiewende towards renewable energy, in contrast to the British nuclear renaissance. So, here emerges another role for social science: critical interrogation of what lies behind the official picture. Our own recent research on the Hinkley question suggests the best way to understand this continuing commitment  and the contrast with Germany  lies in the relative qualities of the two democracies. The post-war German constitution, and a more critical political culture, makes it easier for Germany to resist incumbent industrial interests and ease itself out of lock-in. And our research suggests there is a further  seriously neglected  factor that may underlie the intense attachment of successive UK governments to civil nuclear power. This involves parallel UK commitments to maintain nuclear submarine capabilities. Without the cover provided by lower-tier contracts in civil nuclear construction, the diminished UK nuclear manufacturing sector would simply not be able to build these formidable technological artefacts. Nor could they easily be operated without civil infrastructures for nuclear research, design, training, maintenance and regulation. So a consequence of withdrawing from nuclear power might also be very serious for a particular version of British identity  especially in the coming post-Brexit era. It is nuclear military prowess that supposedly allows the UK to punch above its weight on the world stage. Yet, although this rationale for continued UK nuclear commitments is clearly documented on the military side, it is unmentioned anywhere in official civil nuclear policy statements  and in energy debates more widely. What this might mean for policy is a moot point. But by opening up this kind of wider discussion, social science can undertake its trickiest  but arguably most useful  task in any controversy. The stakes in this particular case transcend nuclear debates alone  and raise questions about the overall health of British democracy.

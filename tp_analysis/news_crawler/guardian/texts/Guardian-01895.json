    "text": "Public money is being wasted on trying to reopen rights of way unused for decades, or even centuries, while authorities struggle for funds to keep existing paths and bridleways in good condition, according to a report by rural landowners. The legal system on public access defies &quot;all sense of propriety and logic&quot; and is &quot;long-winded, expensive and completely incomprehensible to the ordinary person&quot;, says the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) report The Right Way Forward. Harry Cotterell, the association&apos;s president, says in its foreword that tens of thousands of pounds &quot;can be spent pursuing claims for ways which have not been used for centuries, if ever, while present-day users struggle along overgrown paths because there is not enough money for maintenance&quot;. The system offers more than 137,000 miles of public footpaths, bridleways and byways in England and Wales, a level of access &quot;admired throughout the world&quot;, says Cotterell. However, &quot;public access is a minefield of legal complexity; a tortuous and archaic system beloved only by those who can turn its convoluted procedures and subtleties to their own advantage&quot;, he says. &quot;This disadvantages the ordinary person and, because of the costs of the system, benefits no one.&quot; The report says attempts to correct small errors in &quot;definitive&quot; maps, the legal records of public footpaths, bridleways and byways in England and Wales, have to go through the same costly bureaucratic procedures as major changes such as attempted path closures. &quot;At present it can take many years to process a rights of way claim, resulting in enormous cost and ongoing uncertainty for all. Even once fought and won, cases can be reopened and examined all over again  hardly a sensible use of scarce resources,&quot; it says. It is also &quot;unjust&quot; that property owners &quot;have no right to request paths are diverted out of their gardens or away from busy, and potentially dangerous, farmyards&quot;, says the report. &quot;It is unfair  to users and landowners  that no clear consistent width is applied to public rights of way. &quot;It is extraordinary that there is no consistency for livestock owners who currently have the right to place a gate or stile on a footpath or bridleway which crosses a field, but not if a byway does so.&quot; The association also calls for changes to laws over liability for incidents involving livestock. &quot;It cannot be right that livestock owners, with little place else to keep their livestock other than their fields, can be held liable for their stock when they have not been at fault.&quot; Farmers and other livestock keepers should only be liable when animals are inherently dangerous or owners have been negligent, the association argues. The walkers&apos; association Ramblers attacked the CLA report as &quot;opportunistic&quot;. Ramblers&apos; chief executive, Benedict Southworth, said: &quot;With announcements expected any day now from government on reducing environmental &apos;red tape&apos;, and plans already unveiled this week about reducing farming regulation, we feel that this represents a further attack on our rights to walk in and enjoy the countryside. &quot;At the moment there is a system which manages the fine balance between respecting the needs of the landowner against the enjoyment of those wishing to walk in the countryside. If these changes were implemented by the government that balance would be destroyed.&quot;",

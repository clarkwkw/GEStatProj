    "text": "Do you have a burning question about the Higgs boson, supersymmetry or the standard of the coffee in the canteen at the home of the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva? On Sunday 25 March as part the Guardian&apos;s Open Weekend, three scientists at the cutting edge of physics will be on hand to answer all the most basic or esoteric questions that may have built up in your mind (where they might well be burning a hole) over the past year of incredible research results. Led by the Guardian&apos;s Ian Sample and our superstar physics blogger, Prof Jon Butterworth, this is your chance to get a possible explanation for those strange, apparently faster-than-light neutrinos, and find out what happens after the LHC has finally found the Higgs particle. It may be just the start of the many wonders that will emerge from the collider in the coming decades. Physicists Dr Tara Shears of the University of Liverpool and Prof Ben Allanach of the University of Cambridge will also be on hand to guide you through the new frontier in our understanding of the fabric of the universe. Continuing the physics theme we have the celebrated author and broadcaster, Jim Al-Khalili, who will be interviewed on stage on Saturday afternoon. Regular readers of the Guardian&apos;s science pages will know we&apos;re big fans of Prof Al-Khalili&apos;s work. His history of Arabic science, television programmes on electricity, atoms and chaos, and Radio 4 interviews of scientists will provide plenty of talking points as the good professor takes us on a tour of his life and work. Hopefully we can also prod him to reveal more about his upcoming projects, including a much-anticipated new book that examines how the ideas of quantum mechanics are starting to be used to explain biological processes. Watch this space. For anyone who like a bit of ethical debate with their science, Sunday&apos;s session on neuroscience and the law might fit the bill. Geraint Rees, director of the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, will discuss how our ever-improving understanding of the brain might impact on the way we treat defendants in the courts. Chaired by Matthew Taylor of the RSA, this discussion will focus on how neuroscience fits into the needs of the law. What constitutes sufficient legal evidence and what role can neuroscience play in building the cases of prosecutors (and defendants)? Will brain scans one day detect deception in someone accused of murder or determine whether a claimant is malingering rather than feeling genuine pain when suing for a personal injury? The ethicist John Harris and barrister Michael Mansfield QC will make their cases. Other friends of the Guardian appearing over the weekend include David Miliband, Polly Toynbee, Charlie Brooker and Ian McEwan. Science and tech fans will find a whole range of delights on offer during the two-day festival, including how to make podcasts and videos, guides on web tools and journalism, and even a masterclass in photography. We hope to bring you some teasers from the sessions over the coming weeks, either in this blog or on the Science Weekly podcast, so keep an eye out, get involved in the discussions and, hopefully, we will see you in March.",

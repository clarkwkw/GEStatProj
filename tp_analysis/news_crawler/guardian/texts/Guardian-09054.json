    "text": "This ethereal eye in the dead of space is the remains of a star that once resembled our sun in the constellation of Aquarius, 650m light years from Earth. The blue regions are intense waves of ultraviolet light that pour out of the dying star and heat up the outer layers of dust and gas, making them glow red, yellow and green in this image. Known as the Helix nebula, the fading star belongs to a class of celestial objects named &quot;planetary nebulae&quot; in the 18th century, after their likeness to gas giants, such as Jupiter. At the heart of the image, red and blue regions combine to produce a vibrant pink core. The death of a star is as certain as the end of life, and comes when its hydrogen and helium has burned away, to leave only a hot, dense white dwarf no bigger than Earth. Though tiny by comparison, the white dwarf has almost the same mass as the parent star, a teaspoon full weighing as much as several elephants, according to Nasa. Our sun will suffer the same fate in around 5bn years. The picture combines ultraviolet images from Nasa&apos;s Galaxy Evolution Explorer (Galex) telescope with infrared views from the agency&apos;s Spitzer Space Telescope.",

    "text": "It is time to get excited about Comet PANSTARRS, the first of two comets that have led some people to say that 2013 is the Year of the Comets. The comet appears to be outperforming the expectations we had just a few weeks ago and seems poised to put on a fine show in our evening twilight. Observers in the southern hemisphere saw it slip into the twilight last week as a naked-eye object near the 2nd magnitude with an obvious dusty tail. It reached perihelion on 10 March, 45 million km from the Sun and 166 million km from the Earth. Britain&apos;s earliest sight of Comet PANSTARRS may come on 12 March when it is 6 high and 6 to the left of the very slender Moon in the W forty minutes after sunset. Binoculars and a pristine western horizon are needed to see either of them in the bright twilight but the prospects are improving as the comet climbs and is visible longer each night in a darkening sky. It lies 7 below and right of the more obvious earthlit Moon on the 13th. The sky covered by our chart leans over slightly from the W to the NW one hour after sunset on the 12th and shows the comet&apos;s path and changing tail orientation over the coming weeks. Of course, the stars here are sinking lower and to the right from night to night, and the dashed line represents the horizon centred on the NW one hour after sunset on 12 April. Expect the comet to shine near the 2nd magnitude as it become visible, with its dusty tail slanting towards the 10-o&apos;clock position and curving slightly backwards to its motion. A fainter straight tail of ionised gas may be seen above it, pointing more directly away from the Sun&apos;s position. The apparent lengths of the tails will depend strongly on the brightness of our sky but may reach (guesswork alert!) 10 or more. PANSTARRS may dim to the 5th magnitude by mid-April when it stands below Cassiopeia in the NNW at nightfall, and to the right of Cassiopeia in the NE before dawn. Some optimists have claimed that the second of this year&apos;s promising comets, Comet ISON, could grow bright enough to be visible in broad daylight as it grazes the Sun at perihelion in November. Predicting the future performance of new comets is little more than a guess and we should be steeled for disappointment. Indeed, there is increasingly concern that Comet ISON&apos;s development has stalled even as it draws closer to the Sun.",

    "text": "A thousand years ago, the Japanese diarist Sei Shnagon wrote: &quot;If writing did not exist, what terrible depressions we should suffer from.&quot; This I know all too well, and I when I look back at the articles I&apos;ve written in the last four years, I can trace the ups and downs of my life in the frequency of my postings and the tone they convey. The battle against depression is a very personal thing: services for those with mental health problems are still poor, and as we go through life we tend to develop our own coping strategies, with varying degrees of success. For me it&apos;s writing and tidying; others swear by exercise.  The relationship between exercise and depression has been the subject of three recent articles in the Guardian, each based on a press release by the University of Bristol, based in turn on a research paper published in the BMJ on Wednesday. These articles have been criticized for misrepresenting the original research, so let&apos;s trace the conclusion from the paper across June 6th, as it passed through the university press release, via an early piece at the BBC, into the Guardian articles.  First came the paper. Its abstract concludes:  Research Paper: &quot;The addition of a facilitated physical activity intervention to usual care did not improve depression outcome or reduce use of antidepressants compared with usual care alone.&quot;  &apos;Facilitated physical activity intervention&apos; is a rather clunky term. It basically refers to prescribed exercise, and patients were free to do as much or as little as they wanted. As Tom Chivers put it today, &quot;What the study found is that people who are advised to exercise do not, on average, do better than people who are given the ordinary treatments.&quot; The BMJ believe the question needs more research, pointing out that patients in the trial &quot;already received high quality care ... 57% were taking antidepressants at recruitment,&quot; and that a quarter of the patients were getting plenty of exercise anyway: &quot;It may have been difficult for the addition of a physical activity intervention to make an appreciable difference.&quot;  NHS Choices point out that the study, &quot;assessed just one type of exercise intervention that involved facilitating greater activity levels,&quot; and therefore can&apos;t tell us much about other types of exercise programme. In any case, only long term outcomes were measured, with patients self-reporting symptoms every few months: exercise might give you a temporary boost, but if so it wouldn&apos;t be detected in this type of trial.  So, the research shows that a specific intervention to encourage people to exercise didn&apos;t have much long-term impact on patient outcomes beyond the effects of their conventional therapy. With that in mind, here are the same conclusions as they appear in the press release:  Press Release: &quot;New research published today [6 June] in the BMJ, suggests that adding a physical activity intervention to usual care did not reduce symptoms of depression more than usual care alone&quot; Press Release - Prof. John Campbell: &quot;This carefully designed research study has shown that exercise does not appear to be effective in treating depression.&quot;  The first statement is not brilliantly-worded, just repeating a phrase form the abstract that becomes quite ambiguous when taken out of its original context. The killer though is the quote by Professor Campbell, one of the authors, who - whether by accident or bad editing - seems to be saying something completely at odds with the conclusion of his own paper.  As the embargo lifted, the BBC ran the Campbell quote under the headline &quot;Exercise advice questioned&quot;, opening with:  BBC Report (1:29am): &quot;Combining exercise with conventional treatments for depression does not improve recovery, research suggests.&quot;  The BBC report is then linked to in the opening of Simon Hattenstone&apos;s piece for the Guardian, who is followed in turn by Mark Rice-Oxley:  Guardian - Hattenstone (16.33pm): &quot;...some party pooper has just published a report saying that exercise is no good for depression.&quot; Guardian - Rice-Oxley (20.00pm): &quot;The conclusion: all that exercise, the running, cycling, swimming, walking that you did to help you through the dark days of an illness that no one really understands was basically of no benefit to your state of mind. In short, exercise doesn&apos;t help.&quot;  Both get the paper wrong, yet both are apparently in agreement with one of the paper&apos;s authors. It is, in short, a bit of a mess.  People are quick to point to journalists and columnists when they get things wrong, and they&apos;re absolutely right; the people who tell us about the world have a responsibility to try and get their facts right. Journalists shouldn&apos;t base entire articles on press releases without checking that the statements in them are accurate. That&apos;s not the only problem here, however: the press release itself was poorly communicated, and Bristol University&apos;s PR people have included quotes that seem to misrepresent their own research.  The result has been a game of Chinese whispers, preserved in the digital amber of the internet; each attempt to retell the story drifting further from the original truth, and leaving the public more confused than ever.

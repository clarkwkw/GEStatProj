    "text": "Featuring boss characters the size of planets and a hero with enough insane combo attacks to take down a moderately sized army, Asura&apos;s Wrath is the latest slice of incendiary hack-n-slash action from Capcom.  Due out at the end of February, the game follows eponymous assassin Asura who wakes from a 12,000-year coma to take vengeance on the galactic warlords who murdered his wife and kidnapped his daughter. From here, it looks to be a hyper-kinetic third-person brawler, with epic narrative sequences and an episodic structure echoing an anime TV series. If you&apos;ve played the recent Xbox Live demo you&apos;ll know what to expect, including a battle with a stone giant the size of a skyscraper, and the aforementioned face-off with a planet-sized demi-god who tries to squash Asura with one gigantic finger.  A big part of the game is its extravagant anime/manga styling, and Capcom is holding a manga drawing master class at Orbital Comics on Great Newport Street between 9.30am and 11am on Wednesday. The session will be taken by established UK manga artist Hayden Scott-Barrett from Sweatdrop Studios, and the game will also be playable on the day. It&apos;s mostly for the games media, but Capcom has been kind enough to make 10 tickets available to Guardian readers.  If you want to come along, all you have to do is send an email to Capcom. The first 10 to arrive in Capcom&apos;s intray will get an invite.",

    "text": "Thyme, eyebright, bedstraw, trefoil: the bunting of a wild republic is strung across Windmill Hill. Small heath butterflies, like corners of envelopes licked by the breeze, and sleek, burlesque burnet moths, all shiny red and black, pull into unsteady air. We are celebrating the light: the moments between rains when everything is flung open and gates in the hills are swung by sunshine and summer comes haring over fields. We are celebrating the indomitable green: bursting like gutters, thick with life. But there is a green so dark, it remains untouched by this shaking-out of light. Down the folded lanes under Clee Hill is something evergreen, ever-growing, ever-dying. Older than the union flag in the village hall and even the notion of nations; older than the church tower and what it was raised to say; older than the stone face with wide, blind eyes in the wall, staring from somewhere beyond memory; older than everything but the hill itself; the yew tree leans into the present. Over the hollow-way and its own wellspring below the roots, it is a huge tree and rigged with darkness. Roots and stems and rot, its heart now earth, its life is all lives here, sustained by something beyond indifference and endurance. Now that it has outlived old beliefs, new ones come to hang their offerings on it: clooties, posies, crystals, coins and shiny magpie things which twinkle in its shadows. Water mutters from the liverworted stone-hole under the tree and flows down an iron drain on the roadside, singing into the blackness. In the churchyard behind the tree, sunlight rattles small heath butterflies from the flowers, and they fly across the names of those who wait there.",

    "headline": "Wanted: satellite broadband for a move to Wales", 
    "text": "We have decided to leave the big city behind and move to a very remote location in Wales. After extensive research, it appears the only internet option is satellite broadband, but I am getting so confused by all the options such as renting the equipment, data allowances and different speeds etc. It would be greatly appreciated if you can explain the basics for us less technically minded folk. We currently use the internet to stay in contact with relatives, and a world without internet seems a dull one indeed!Rob PorterSatellites are used to broadcast radio and TV signals over a wide area. With UK services, this usually stretches from the bottom of Italy to the southern parts of Scandinavia, and as far west as Portugal. This is an efficient and cheap use of bandwidth. People who want to receive these broadcasts need a satellite dish to collect the signals, plus equipment to decode and display them  typically a TV set and a set-top box. The same satellites also broadcast data to individual recipients. However, bandwidth is expensive and limited, so this is neither cheap nor efficient. It only makes sense because it can reach areas that are not served by landlines or even 3G mobile services. You can get satellite broadband almost anywhere, as long as you have a clear view to the south. When I used Astra&apos;s satellite broadband service a decade or so ago, it was broadcast only: the back-channel for sending emails and requesting web pages was a dial-up modem connected to an ordinary phone line. Today&apos;s two-way satellite services use satmodems that can both send and receive data. Also, today&apos;s satellite broadband services use variants of the DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) technology developed for digital television. This is faster and can work with smaller dishes, typically 75cm rather than 1m to 2m across. Even so, speeds are much slower than you would get with ADSL2. Advertised download speeds range from 1Mbps to 10Mbps, with upload speeds of 128kbps to about 2Mbps. The main drawbacks with satellite broadband are contention and latency. Contention comes from the fact that thousands of people may be trying to access the satellite &quot;doorway&quot; (perhaps a 4GB channel) at the same time. If there are more requests for data than the satellite can handle, some users have to wait. Against that, some services offer free data use during the night (after 11pm) when demand is low. Latency comes from the fact that the signal has to travel about 36,000km up to the geostationary satellite, and 36,000km down to the ISP&apos;s server, so the round trip is 144,000km. This introduces the slight delay that is noticeable with satellite-connected phone calls. It makes satellite broadband unsuitable for fast-action games, but isn&apos;t a problem with most web pages. (Badly written web pages  ones that require dozens of server &quot;hits&quot;  can be a problem, but satellite service providers try to assemble whole pages before sending them.) A third problem is that satellite connections can be affected by bad weather, though that shouldn&apos;t be much of a problem with modern equipment. Much the same technology is, after all, used for Sky television and Freesat. To use satellite broadband, you will need a dish and a satmodem, but these can vary from service to service, so it&apos;s best to get the whole package from one supplier. You can either assemble and install the dish yourself, or have it done for you. I opted to have the whole thing installed and working. It&apos;s sufficiently complicated that I&apos;d recommend this approach to anyone who doesn&apos;t know much about it. It&apos;s very easy to receive a satellite signal, but sending one requires a higher-quality dish and accurate alignment. Making the purchase is also complicated. The best approach is to set up a spreadsheet of suppliers, check off the functions you need, and enter the prices. The functions you should consider include upload and download speeds, the monthly data allowance, whether the service supports VoIP for making phone calls (possibly with a UK phone number), whether you get a British IP (internet protocol) address, and whether you can get any TV channels from the same dish. In my case, the IP address came from the Astra server in Luxembourg, so I wouldn&apos;t have had direct access to the BBCs iPlayer service, if it had existed at the time. Check the limitations in the &quot;fair use&quot; policies and find out what happens if you go over your monthly data allowance, which might be anything from 2GB to 10GB per month. You may be able to buy top-ups for 15-25 per gigabyte, or the service provider may allow you to keep using the service, but throttle the speed. You can usually start with a low-end package and upgrade it if you find you are using too much data. Either way, bandwidth is expensive. Satellite connections are fine for daily email and web browsing, but a YouTube clip can easily consume 10MB to 50MB. Obviously, it would be foolish to use 2GB to download a single movie. Video chats and internet radio also consume a lot of bandwidth, and file-sharing is silly unless it&apos;s restricted to a free overnight service.  When it comes to pricing, you will need spreadsheet entries for the start-up costs  satellite dish, satmodem, installation, activation  and the running costs, ie the speed and bandwidth allowance per month. The startup costs can range from about 300 to more than 1,000, depending on the equipment. Some costs may be bundled into the monthly bills. This is much the same as getting a &quot;free&quot; 600 smartphone: you still pay 600 for it, but the cost is hidden in 24 monthly payments. If you don&apos;t want to do the work, then BeyonDSL appears to be worth a go. Its ValuePlus services start at 14.99 per month for a 2GB allowance with a 2Mbps download speed, and go up to 49.99 per month for 12GB with download speeds of up to 10Mbps. Until 31 May, BeyonDSL is offering the hardware for 99.99 instead of 299.99, but that&apos;s for the DIY kit. A professional installation costs &quot;from 89.99&quot; and activation costs 50. Yes, it all adds up. While you can use Skype and similar services with BeyonDSL, you can also get a dedicated VoIP service for an extra 6.99 per month. This sets up a separate channel so video chats do not come out of your monthly allowance. The BeyonDSL website also has details of The Welsh Assembly Broadband Support Scheme. &quot;Qualifying Welsh residents, businesses and 3rd sector organisations can apply for up to 1,000 for a satellite broadband installation from BeyonDSL,&quot; until the money runs out. I haven&apos;t tried BeyonDSL, but the company is run by Mike Locke, whom I&apos;ve known in a professional capacity for quite a long time. He worked for Amstrad in the 1990s before moving to Astra, where he supplied the satellite service I reviewed in the Guardian. He knows his stuff. In any case, BeyonDSL&apos;s new &quot;value&quot; broadband service is actually based on the Astra2Connect service (aka SES Broadband) using the 28.2E Astra 3 satellite. This means that if you want TV as well, you&apos;ll need a separate dish and a TV LNB for the 23.5E Astra 2 satellite, or choose one of BeyonDSL&apos;s Broadband/TV packages. These cost from 24.99 to 69.99 per month.            Apogee Internet is an alternative provider of Astra2Connect services using the same satellites as BeyonDSL. Its Max Value home packages cost from 12.99 (2GB at 2Mbps) to 47.99 (10GB at 10Mbps) per month. Services that also include satellite TV cost from 17.99 to 65.99 per month. A rival offering is the Tooway Direct service offered by Tariam Satellite Communications, which is a division of Satellite Solutions Worldwide Ltd. It sells home packages at prices from 24.99 to 99.99 per month. It also provides UK IP addresses. See the FAQ for more details. Tooway costs more, but it&apos;s fast. It uses Eutelsat&apos;s new Ka-Sat (9 East) satellite, which is described as &quot;the first High Throughput Satellite (HTS) in Europe.&quot; Business users can get download speeds of 40Mbps. (Ka-band satellites use a much higher frequency than Ku-band satellites and can carry much more data.) Other companies also sell the Tooway service under their own brand names, if you don&apos;t want to go direct. You may also find established satellite broadband services that use the Avanti Hylas-1 satellite at 33.5 West. Examples include Simply Balanced and Ethnet. You could include them in your spreadsheet, but they don&apos;t look particularly attractive compared to Astra2Connect and Tooway-based services. One last point. When you move to Wales, ask around in the local post office, church, pub etc to find out if anyone already has satellite internet, what they think about it, and whether they would recommend a local installer. If you are lucky, that could be a simple way to solve the problem.",

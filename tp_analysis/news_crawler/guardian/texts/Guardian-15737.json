    "text": "Almost everyone goes to university nowadays, everyone knows that. Except that not everyone does and we rarely see accurate statistics about how many or what proportion of people actually do. It&apos;s quite an important question, bound up with thorny issues of workforce skills, educational aspiration and, of course, how (and how much) the UK taxpayer funds our domestic higher education sector. Against this backdrop came a widely-reported piece of analysis from the department of business, innovation and skills (BIS) on the Higher Education Initial Participation Rate (HEIPR), which examines participation rates for 17-30-year-old English domiciled first-time participants in higher education in the UK, including outside England. Higher education in this context means every kind of accredited higher education course, from two-year foundation degrees delivered at a local further education college, to PhDs from Cambridge. This time round, the HEIPR stood at 49%, up from 46% last year. The media duly reported that almost half of all young people went to university in 2011/12. They didn&apos;t. The HEIPR is an odd beast and it doesn&apos;t measure what you think it might measure. The methodology involves finding the proportion of people at each age from 17 to 30 who are involved in university for the first time  and then summing all of those participation rates. The resulting rate is designed to equate roughly to the probability that a 17-year-old will participate in higher education by the age of 30. It doesn&apos;t measure the proportion of young people going into higher education. Nor does it tell us what proportion of people has a degree  and it shouldn&apos;t be presented as if it does. What if we do want to know this information? Where do we go? Well, there are a couple of places. The first is government datasets. The Annual Population Survey involves a sample of 155,000 households and 360,000 people, and is rigorously audited. It is good data and you can interrogate it using Nomis, a service from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Using Nomis, we can see that in 2012, 34.4% of the working age population of Great Britain, aged 16 to 64, achieved NVQ4+ (a degree-level or equivalent qualification or above). You can check my working if you like  here is the report I ran. Related data reveals that 40.2% of those in work have a degree or equivalent  unsurprisingly, degree holders are more likely to be in work than those without. We can also get data from the census. This has some advantages  a much, much larger sample  and some disadvantages  it&apos;s only taken every 10 years. Fortunately, we had one in 2011, so the data is still quite relevant. It&apos;s now possible to examine census data yourself using Nomis, but the ONS also produced a report of some of the key facts in December 2012, which found that 27.2% of the population aged 16 to 74 had a degree or equivalent or higher  about 12 million people all told. This proportion is lower than the proportion for 16 to 64-year-olds because of the much smaller participation rates for the 64-74 age group covered by the census. What none of this addresses is the proportion of people that the UK needs educated to degree level. That&apos;s even trickier, as the nature of work changes with time. A modern economy with rapidly-developing technology like ours tends to demand more skills and qualifications as time goes on. The recent Skills and Employment Survey found that 26% of jobs in the economy explicitly require a degree  or, put another way, if you don&apos;t go to university, more than a quarter of jobs are inaccessible to you. If we then return to the APS data for the whole country and look at jobs in the managerial, professional and associate professional categories  those that are deemed &apos;graduate level&apos;  we find they make up 43.6% of the jobs in the economy. This doesn&apos;t mean that some graduates aren&apos;t currently working in sub-graduate level jobs  they are  but it does suggest that we have room for a few more graduates yet. In short, it&apos;s not actually very easy to work out what proportion of the UK population has degrees (nor how many more or less graduates the economy needs). Depending on which dataset you study, it&apos;s 27.2% or 34.4% or 40.2% of the population. It certainly isn&apos;t 49%. Most people don&apos;t go to university and current data suggests that most people in the UK never will.

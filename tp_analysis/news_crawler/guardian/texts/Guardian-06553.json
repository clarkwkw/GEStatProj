    "text": "This week on Tech Weekly with Aleks Krotoski and Guardian technology editor Charles Arthur we meet the Oscar-winning documentary maker Charles Ferguson. Ferguson may be a noted author and film-maker (he bagged an Oscar for his documentary Inside Job about the global banking meltdown) but his roots are planted firmly in technology as the founder of one of the first web code companies, Vermeer  snapped up by Microsoft in the 1990s. This experience formed the background to his autobiographical book High Stakes, No Prisoners: A Winner&apos;s Tale of Greed and Glory in the Internet Wars. Ferguson discusses his role in the early development of the internet and why big companies start to fail in middle age.  Also this week Aleks and Charles discuss a raft of news around Facebook from meetings between Mark Zuckerberg and Rupert Murdoch, the social network&apos;s new-found relationship with Yahoo and why Facebook appeared to censor a Syrian anti-torture campaign. Finally, Charles Arthur discusses the latest malware to be disabled, DNSChanger which originated in Estonia and took over browsers around the world. Don&apos;t forget to...

    "text": "I was dismayed by the statement by Professor John Beddington, the government&apos;s chief scientific adviser, that a nuclear energy-free future for the UK is not something the coalition is thinking seriously about (Report, 26 March). You quote him as adding: &quot;We really can&apos;t see a future for the UK energy sector, if we are to meet our climate change obligations and have resilience in the power sector, without a significant component of nuclear.&quot; The Department of Energy and Climate Change has provided an extensive online energy modelling system and invited interested people and organisations to use it. The British Pugwash Group spent a year doing just that and recently published the results as a set of 2050 energy Pathways. It included one I helped with, which showed clearly that it was possible to meet the UK&apos;s energy needs at reasonable cost with no nuclear power, while reducing emissions below current 2050 targets. Evidently we were wasting our time.Professor David ElliottOpen University ",

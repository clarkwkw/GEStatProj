    "text": "On August 24, PC gamers will get to experience one of last year&apos;s finest  and toughest  console releases: From Software&apos;s unrelenting RPG adventure, Dark Souls. As announced on Friday, the new Prepare To Die edition of the Xbox 360 and PS3 hit will feature a whole new chapter, Artorias of the Abyss, and a refined PVP mode which will make it easier for players to arrange competitive battles against their friends online. Plus, of course, the frame rate and texture detail will be given a lift. That&apos;s all we knew when we went into a group interview with Dark Souls director Hidetaka Miyazaki at Namco&apos;s Global Gamer Day event in Las Vegas. And that&apos;s pretty much all will still know  although Miyazaki did clarify some key points.  The main question everyone has had since the announcement is whether console owners will get the extra content created for the PC release  perhaps as DLC. Namco&apos;s response to this has been, let&apos;s say, ambiguous. For Miyazaki&apos;s part, he said From Software had nothing to say at this point. &quot;It&apos;s completely understandable that people who bought the console version have those questions. However, as the director of Dark Souls I cannot answer your question right now. I want to apologise to console owners that I don&apos;t have any news at this point.&quot; It would, however, be difficult to imagine Namco not bringing Artorias of the Abyss over to console. Indeed, there were rumours circulating the Gamers Day event that the company may even be considering a full retail release for a Dark Souls: Prepare To Die edition on console. It&apos;s likely we&apos;ll get more information at E3. Another element Miyazaki wouldn&apos;t be drawn on is the apparent decision by Namco to use Games for Windows Live for the PC game&apos;s online content. At the Namco Gamers Day event, box art of the title showed a GFWL logo, prompting a disappointed response from some gamers who view the service as inferior to other contenders such as Steam. However, while Miyazaki wouldn&apos;t comment, Namco&apos;s publishing producer for the game, Daisuke Uchiyama, told reporters that the final decision had yet to be made and that partnership negotiations were ongoing.     Dark Souls    Miyazaki did provide a few small details about the additional chapter. Apparently, it will feature &quot;three to four&quot; new boss characters and the same number of areas, as well as a fresh storyline. &quot;There will also be more NPCs and more enemies,&quot; he said. &quot;And the equipment of these characters will be available for the player to wear.&quot; He also mentioned that the area will fit into the game at some point after the middle of the game, and certainly later than Sen&apos;s Fortress.  Apart from this addition, PC owners can pretty much expect a straight port of the console version. &quot;There were many things that I didn&apos;t like or would have changed in the console versions,&quot; Miyazaki admitted. &quot;But if you change every single element, it won&apos;t be Dark Souls anymore. We might tune it a little bit but we&apos;re not going to make any drastic changes.&quot; I also asked whether the area in the chapter was something originally cut from the console version, but apparently it&apos;s brand new. &quot;The new areas were designed after the console release,&quot; he said. &quot;However, we did have the idea when we were developing the game, but none of the team members took it seriously at the time. It&apos;s 99% new content.&quot; Moving on, it seems Dark Souls on PC will not support any sort of user modification or editing  unlike, say, Skyrim with its creation kit. &quot;Personally, I am interested in the concept of Mods,&quot; said Miyazaki. &quot;However, due to our lack of experience with the PC we need more time to adapt to what PC gamers want from mods. So this time we&apos;re not doing it.&quot; The game will also only offer limited support for mouse and keyboard control. &quot;Since it&apos;s a straight port of the console version, we recommend that players use a joypad. We will support the keyboard, but it will be minimal.&quot;  Finally, we asked Miyazaki about the mysterious pendant that players of the console version can select as a gift at the start of the game, but which seemingly has little use in the subsequent adventure. Is there more to this controversial trinket? &quot;Oh, the pendant?&quot; he laughed. &quot;I am aware that many people are wondering about the meaning of it ... but let&apos;s keep it as a secret. I can&apos;t answer the question now. I won&apos;t answer it for the rest of my life.&quot;",

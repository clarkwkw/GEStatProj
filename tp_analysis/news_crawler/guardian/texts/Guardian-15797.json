    "text": "Can science and technology help bring us out of the economic crisis? What areas of science research should be prioritised? How should university science degrees be funded? Should the public have a say in investment in science and technology? These are mighty questions that cause many an experienced policy maker or scientist to scratch their heads. They are the subject of much heated debate and there are certainly no easy answers, especially in times of financial austerity when tough choices about funding need to be made.  So what happens when 1418 year old science students are faced with the same issues? Last November, the Royal Institution L&apos;Oral Young Scientist Centre in London brought 150 of them together to find out.  By luck rather than design, the event coincided with George Osborne&apos;s speech at the Royal Society outlining his belief in the value of science as a driver of the UK economy. That this was pretty neat was not lost on the students. &quot;It&apos;s pretty cool that we were debating the exact same issues as the Chancellor on the future of science investment,&quot; said one. The format of the Ri event was quite unconventional. Rather than a usual conference, where the audience sits passively receiving information and there is limited opportunity to ask questions  let alone influence the trajectory of the discussion  the students were thrown in at the deep end. They were asked to work out what they thought the upcoming issues were in science policy and to give some thought on how these issues might be tackled.  All opinions and ideas were liveblogged on Twitter with the hashtag #RiUnconference to increase the flow of dialogue and share it with others who were unable to attend. Teenagers in large groups can be difficult to engage in live discussion  at least that&apos;s our experience at most other Ri events. But Twitter enabled those too shy to speak out to contribute their thoughts actively through the medium they felt most comfortable using. I was fortunate enough to be on the panel of experts. We had the delightful task of hearing the main conclusions and recommendations of the day. It was genuinely uplifting to see such young students developing a &quot;voice&quot; on science policy in such a short period of time. As someone involved at the coal face of &quot;science and society&quot; issues, I was particularly inspired by the mature discussion around the public&apos;s involvement with R&amp;D. In summary, yes they thought it was a good thing but, they said, there also need to be more schemes and opportunities to counter the public&apos;s apathy towards science, which they perceived as a direct threat to science research itself.  This was something that Professor John Perkins, chief scientific adviser at BIS and fellow panel member, picked up on too: &quot;Clearly one of the big take home messages from today is that more public engagement in science is needed: genuine engagement, not just informing them about science, but actually involving them in scientific matters and decision making about how money needs to be deployed.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ll have to go away and think about how that might work  &quot; he added. Personally, I&apos;d like to see how that might work too. The only successful scheme I know of where the public is involved in deciding how research money is spent is at the Alzheimer&apos;s Society where research proposals are first evaluated by carers. Only those proposals deemed relevant to their needs then undergo the usual peer review process.  It&apos;s perhaps relatively easy to see how this works, with carers having such a vested interest in the focus of Alzheimer&apos;s research. But which group of &quot;the public&quot; would decide on the funding strategy for particle physics, for instance, or crystallography, or synthetic biology? How exactly would that work? Would today&apos;s scientists feel equally as comfortable engaging in a discussion about how we might actually achieve this, as tomorrow&apos;s scientists at the Ri unconference clearly did? These students were aware that the answers to these questions are complex. &quot;public should have say on everything that government does as what they are doing is affecting us&quot; tweeted one. But &quot;do the public have enough knowledge about areas of science to influence spending?&quot; added another. The Ri unconference has convinced me of the importance of exposing students to the complexity and messiness of science policy at a young age. Perhaps, however, the best piece of evidence in favour of developing and nurturing a young scientific voice comes from the students themselves: &quot;I learned a lot about the issues my generation will have to face in the future and how complex they can be to solve. It was a good chance for us to voice our opinions and have discussions with people from other schools.&quot; Dr Gail Cardew is director of science and education at the Royal Institution and chair of the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) supervisory board More information about the Ri Unconference can be found in the report (pdf).

    "text": "Stories about full-time university students always grab the spotlight, the fall in overall numbers being the latest headline-grabbing story. Part-time students usually go unnoticed, even though they make up 30% of all undergraduates. In many respects, these are the government&apos;s ideal students: they work and study at the same time and they provide the skills needed for economic growth. But the word on the street is not good: part-time enrolments are down big time compared with last year, by as much as 30% at some universities. And the overall fall in part-time enrolments is likely to be larger than the fall for full-time students in England. Just like their full-time peers, part-timers&apos; tuition fees have risen threefold to a maximum of 6,750 a year, which equates to 9,000 a year for a full-time equivalent course. For the first time, some new part-time university entrants can get student loans for their fees, and so will no longer have to pay up-front. They will start to repay their loans four and half years after they started their course, sooner if their course is shorter, but only if they are earning 21,000 a year. They will continue to pay 9% of their income until they have paid off their loan, or for no more than 30 years when their debt will be forgiven. These reforms aim to encourage more people to study part-time and to stem the general decline in part-time higher education study. But they may well have the opposite effect. The government estimates that around 30% of part-time students will benefit from loans. But the majority will not qualify, and will have to continue to pay their fees up-front  those who already have a degree, or those who study less than a quarter of a full-time course. Will these people still go to university or will they opt out because they can&apos;t get any financial support from their employer, and are unable or unwilling to pay high fees up-front? We will not know for sure what is happening until January 2013. There is no early warning system on part-time university applications or acceptances since part-time students do not apply via the centralised University and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas). But the results of a new study give some insight into the challenges ahead. The study, funded by the Higher Education Careers Services Unit, followed a group of part-time students over time. They were interviewed in 2008 and then again in 2010, so are unaffected by the changes in student funding. Even so, between 2007/8 and 2010/11 their fees rose by 27%  far in excess of inflation at 4.4%. Both students and their employers shared the cost of these fee increases, despite the recession. But our evidence suggests that now employers are less likely to pay all of their employees&apos; tuition fees and that more students are making a contribution. Taken together, the changes may restrict opportunities to study part-time. Fewer part-time students will be able to rely on their employer for financial help with fees, and will have to pay for some or all of these much larger fees themselves. This will particularly affect the majority who don&apos;t qualify for loans, especially low-income students wishing to update their skills. For those who do qualify for the loans, some may decide not to take them out, especially those who already have sizable financial commitments with mortgages and children; those who are debt averse and those who feel that paying 9% of their income to repay their student loan is more than they can manage or are prepared to pay given the uncertainties of living in a recession. The net result is that part-time higher education study may continue to decline rather than grow. This is not what the government, or the higher education sector, wants. Investing in skills development throughout a person&apos;s lifetime is at the heart of skills policies, and part-time higher education study is integral to that. Higher education funding policies need to support that ambition.  Claire Callender is professor of higher education studies at Birkbeck and the Institute of Education, University of London",

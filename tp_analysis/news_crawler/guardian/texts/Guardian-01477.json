    "text": "Well, a lot of cross-checking, a lot of work, but not a great deal of change in the results. The CERN council seminar on 13 December last year caused a lot of interest, in that a range of possible masses for the Higgs boson were excluded, and there were intriguing hints that it might even be there in the remaining mass range.  The fact that there were talks and a press conference led to some criticism because the results had not been submitted for publication. In fact this was unfair, since detailed technical descriptions of the analyses were made public at the time. These were labelled &quot;preliminary&quot;. This is a way of indicating that some loose ends need to be tied up before submitting the final results for peer review. But the information is there for interested scientists to see, and no one expects major changes. Today&apos;s paper submission shows that these loose ends have now been tied up, and cross-checks have been done. Frankly none of them are interesting enough to describe in detail here. Which is a relief, really. The ATLAS result has not significantly changed; you can read about, and find links to the papers, here. The CMS collaboration have also submitted their papers. I will have annoyed the SEO by not putting &quot;Higgs&quot; (or &quot;god particle&quot; argh argh) in the headline, but actually I deliberately did not, because I don&apos;t think this is big news. I don&apos;t want another round Higgs frenzy (yet). But I thought it was worth recording and explaining a bit more about how the process works, for anyone who is interested. The next thing? The papers will be peer reviewed (by non-ATLAS members, this time) and, we hope, published in journals. But much more importantly, in a few weeks the LHC will turn on again, and then we start collecting more data, and squeezing those probabilities.",

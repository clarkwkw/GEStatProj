    "text": "This week on the Guardian Teacher Network there will be a collection of blogs and info for any teacher wanting to bring the world of computing into their classroom  to engage pupils in code and programming and to de-bunk the myth that computing is only for geeks, nerds  and boys. As part of the Guardian&apos;s Digital Literacy Campaign, the network has teamed up with some of the foremost thinkers and educators to bring you not only resources to help you in the classroom, but ideas, opinions and more. There will be a blog from Manchester Girl Geeks  a not-for-profit group that arranges workshops and events for girls (and women) interested in science, technology, engineering and maths. In addition, the GTN has the top 10 resource treats to share with you from teacher Alan O&apos;Donohoe. O&apos;Donohoe has included in his top 10 resources Scratch  a programming language that can be used in primary and secondary schools to create games, animate, or basically to get anything to walk/talk/sing/dance/bounce/fly. You can take a look at it here. If you would like to know more about code, O&apos;Donohoe suggests taking a look at Codeacademy  a website that helps people to discover what computer programming can be like. For older pupils there is the chance to be a &quot;code hero&quot; by taking part in a game that teaches you how to make games and save the world with a code gun that shoots Javascript. This software will help students to master code from the inside out, to make games and apps of their own. You can find out more about it here. O&apos;Donohoe, who is the founder of Hack 2 the Future events, which encourage children, parents and teachers to find out more about creating games, programming and computing, will also be blogging about Hack 2 the Future and how to get involved. Emma Mulqueeny from Rewired State will also be talking about other great resources to use, including Alice. Alice is a website offering free educational software that teaches students computer programming in a 3D environment. But most of all, the network is hoping that Guardian readers  teachers, educators, parents, techno-freaks and techno-phobes  will take part: log on to the blogs, share resources, explain what things you need  and we will do what we can to provide them. The Guardian Teacher Network has almost 100,000 pages of lesson plans and interactive materials. To see and share for yourself go to teachers.theguardian.com. There are also hundreds of jobs on the site, contact us for a free trial of your first advert: schoolsjobs.theguardian.com.",

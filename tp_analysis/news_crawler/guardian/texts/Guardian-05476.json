    "text": "The sudden clamour of agitated gulls suggests something unusual is going on outside. Stepping out into the garden, it&apos;s not hard to see the cause of the commotion. A sea eagle en route to one of the freshwater lochs has, unwittingly, flown over a colony of nesting common gulls who are attempting to drive it away. Calling shrilly, they harry it mercilessly, circling, swooping, diving, a storm of white against a cloudless blue sky. Powerful though it is, the enormous eagle is no match for their aerial agility and dodges their attentions only clumsily. It flies uncertainly in ever widening circles driven by the tireless gulls  and they are succeeding, for the edge of each circle is just a little farther from the colony. Suddenly the gulls turn back, leaving the eagle alone in the sky. Despite being untroubled now by pursuers, it continues to circle, the previously hurried wingbeats slower and interspersed with more relaxed, longer glides. Sailing on broad, long-fingered wings, it passes repeatedly over our heads. It&apos;s a youngish bird, maybe three years old for, although the wedge-shaped tail hasn&apos;t acquired the white of the adult, the bright sunshine reveals that the huge bill has already turned from juvenile dark to yellow. Now more frequently referred to in English as a white-tailed eagle rather than sea eagle, in Gaelic the bird has a multiplicity of names, perhaps the most beautiful and poetic being iolaire sil na grine  eagle with the sunlit eye. Breaking away from its circling, the eagle heads towards the second of the lochs: though no gulls rise to deter it, the resident greylag geese flee in all directions, scattering in noisy alarm at its approach. But even as it makes its first pass low over the surface of the water it is met by a flock of lapwing vigorously protesting against its presence with their own aerial bombardment.",

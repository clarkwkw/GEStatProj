    "text": "Update: It seems you like our new environment news app, built by Taptu and powered by Guardian content (more details in the original post below). Thousands of you have downloaded the app to your iPads and iPhones, and it has got a rating of 4.5 out of 5 in the app store, so thank you all very much. The feedback is good too. Mark Reed wrote in the app store:  This is one of the best apps I&apos;ve got - I&apos;ve been waiting for someone to develop something like this for ages - there&apos;s a real gap. I&apos;ve paid for apps that say they do this but have no quality/relevance control and deleted them. This has high quality and relevant environment news, categorised and easy to use. Seamless integration with various social media platforms too. I can&apos;t fault this app.  Another commenter, Alex Pretor, liked the use of images:   What more can u ask?? All the environment news in one place! I love the galleries. Simply great photography. Been waiting for an app like this!  Kennedy008 was succinct:  Looks good, easy to use, does what it says. Give it a go!  So if you have an iPad or iPhone and haven&apos;t tried it yet, please do. And be sure to let us know what you&apos;d like added in future versions. Original post: We know you like our news, comment and galleries - and thanks very much for that - so we have worked with app developer Taptu to create a new way for you to enjoy our journalism: a free environment news app for iPad and iPhone. The app is built by Taptu and powered by the Guardian&apos;s content, through our Open Platform. What you get is a choice of story streams, such as climate change or wildlife, which you can tailor to your own tastes. You can also enjoy our incredibly popular picture galleries. Navigating is easy using the touch interface and you can share stories on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter with a tap of the finger, or save them for later with Instapaper, Read it Later or Taptu&apos;s bookmark stream.  We have also included streams from some of our partners in the Guardian Environment Network, including Business Green, Yale Environment 360, Mother Jones&apos;s green channel and the IPS Inter Press Service, as well as others such as Reuters environment news. That means you can get all the latest green news in one place. I hope you&apos;ll download it now and give it go. I think it&apos;s fantastic and we are already thinking of new features to add to later versions. So, if you like it, do let us know and, if you don&apos;t, let us know why.",

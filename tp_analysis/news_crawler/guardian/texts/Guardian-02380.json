    "text": "As the developer of PS3 darlings fl0w and Flower, US developer thatgamecompany is commonly invoked by proponents of the &quot;games as art&quot; debate. Latest release Journey is likely only to strengthen this perception of the studio as operating on a higher plane than its peers. Modern conventions are jettisoned with gusto, sparsely populated but stunning vistas are preferred to crowd scenes and the story is only hinted at through occasional, silent cut scenes. There&apos;s just the player, a luminescent mountain on the horizon and a vast expanse of sand between the two. If you&apos;re lucky, as you guide your adventurer through Journey&apos;s two-hour run time, you&apos;ll spot a fellow wanderer in the distance. You venture forth together, taking in the same sights, communicating only through musical shouts  but you don&apos;t know who your companion is until the credits have rolled. There are no lobbies, invites, voice chat or leaderboards, but this remains the finest online experience you&apos;ll have in 2012.",

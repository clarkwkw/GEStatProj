When I was growing up, the summer rains in Manicaland would start in August or September and end in April. Now the rains come in November or December. They are very heavy and they end around February. My parents have not had a maize harvest for five years. They are only managing to grow groundnuts and millet now. When boreholes dry up around October, you start to have sanitation issues, like cholera or diarrhoea. When rivers dry up because the rains are late, livestock die and children are kept out of school. In rural Zimbabwe people pay school expenses  fees, books and uniforms  by selling their cattle. When families have no cattle, children are kept out of school. This aggravates the Aids situation because teenage girls hang around the shops and have sex with strangers for $10. That is when they get HIV. You cannot address sustainable development or start talking about solar energy until people have something to eat. That is why HIV educators in Zimbabwe now travel with the people handing out food aid. They say &quot;now you have food, let us talk about condoms or about the importance of diet when taking your anti-retrovirals&quot;.",

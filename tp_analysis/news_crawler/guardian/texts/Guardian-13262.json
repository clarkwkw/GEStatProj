    "text": "Paypal has long dominated the web transaction market, but the obligation to have an account with the provider means sellers can often miss out on the casual buyer who isn&apos;t determined enough to complete an online registration with the company.  For this reason global crowdfunding website Indiegogo has announced it is forming a partnership with a second global payments company, Adyen, to enable transactions using local card payments including Maestro in the UK, Carte Bleu in France and Giropay in Germany.  Indiegogo, which helps startups raise funds without having to resort to banks or venture capital firms, launched its sterling and euro service in December and has already seen a 20% increase in activity.  The site was launched five years ago and has helped 100,000 new companies and services around the world raise money, ranging from restaurants to theatre companies and gadgets such as a current campaign for an inflatable solar light.  Co-founder Danae Ringelmann, a former Wall Street banker, said: &quot;Anything we can do to make it easier for our customers to give and receive contributions in their native currencies and languages is a big priority,&quot; she said.  Adyen processes online, mobile and point of sale payments for nearly 3,000 international customers including Vodafone and fashion chain Mango, and supports 218 local payment options.  It says its customers see a 35% increase in conversion rates when they offer a local payment option.",

    "text": "&quot;When I heard about giving birth in a hospital on Radio Sila, it was the first time anyone suggested that to me,&quot; says 37-year-old Achta Abakar Ibrahim, a Darfur refugee and mother of 10. She sits in the shade of her compound in Djabal camp, near Goz Beda, eastern Chad, plaiting the hair of her four-year-old daughter, Malia. &quot;My first six children I had at home, and although  thanks to God  I didn&apos;t have any serious problems, it was just so much easier in the hospital,&quot; she says. &quot;There, they know what can go wrong, and that made me so much more confident.&quot; Radio Sila is one of three radio stations  the other two are Absoun in Iriba and Voix de Ouaddai in Abeche  which were set up in 2005 and 2006 by the international media development charity Internews. Now, similar stories to Ibrahim&apos;s can be heard in many of the 12 camps dotted along Chad&apos;s border with Sudan, home to 265,000 people displaced by conflict in Darfur, or in the host villages that welcomed them.The stations use a mix of targeted social action programmes and innovations on a range of subjects, often those considered taboo in local communities. These have included interactive phone-ins and discussions to provide information, and a communications channel between refugees and aid agencies. &quot;People talk much more openly on the radio. They listen to each other and learn from each other&apos;s experience,&quot; says Nalga Katir, who organised a debate on female genital mutilation, sponsored by the UN Population Fund, in the refugee camps. &quot;They&apos;re just a voice on the radio, so it allows them to debate in a way they would be afraid to face-to-face, and then you see after the programme people are sitting in the shade of a tree still discussing it.&quot; However, despite the fact that almost none of the Darfuris are returning home, funding for refugee projects in the region is getting harder to come by  and the radio stations are no exception. Internews pulled out at the end of July. Formal training on management matters and revenue generation was given to local journalists, who had been trained by the organisation, before it left, and the stations are now in the process of transforming into independent community radio associations. Money will be an enormous challenge. Radio Voix de Ouaddai has projected a budget of $60,000 for the year ahead, an enormous sum in a country where a journalist&apos;s average wage is $150 a month. Advertising revenues are few and far between, as a culture of publicity has yet to take off in Chad, particularly in the isolated villages of the east. So how will they do it? &quot;We will start charging for services which used to be free before,&quot; says Abdelzerak Arabi, manager of Radio Sila. &quot;For example, a government notice will be 5,000CFA ($10), or a notice about a death or [a] funeral will be 1,000CFA ($2).&quot; It&apos;s hoped that a core funding grant from the UN Development Programme will also materialise, which promises $250,000 to the radio stations for the next year, and about 15 journalists have agreed to work for free in the meantime. Money aside, Chad still presents unique difficulties to journalists. Although media regulations and laws have been significantly relaxed in recent years, in 2008 a number of journalists were arrested after rebel attacks on the capital, N&apos;Djamena. There are problems with electricity supply, repairing equipment and poor roads, and many people in Chad are reluctant to talk to journalists. There are just 34 radio stations in the whole country; in Iriba and Goz Beda, there was no other media at all before Internews arrived. But it seems the Internews stations have made huge strides in achieving the ultimate objective of a community radio station  to become valued and loved by the people they serve.&quot;What I like about the radio journalists is they go and look with their own eyes, and then talk about what&apos;s happening. I trust that they verify the story before they publish,&quot; says Mohammed Ali Ismael Zidane, in a market in Goz Beda. Whether that love of radio can translate into tangible support for the teams in Abeche, Goz Beda and Iriba is a big question, but for now at least there is a will to survive. &quot;I love being a journalist, it&apos;s the best job in the world,&quot; says Madjihinguem Nguinabe, a Radio Sila journalist who&apos;s agreed to work for free. &quot;I will give everything I have, from the training and [the] knowledge, all my energy and spirit to keep this station running.&quot;",

    "text": "Samsung&apos;s flagship Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note smartphones, and its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet, could be banned in the US after Apple asked a federal court there to ban them as part of an ongoing lawsuit it is bringing against the South Korean company. The iPhone maker has added the phones to a case which is running in parallel to its just-concluded patent infringement case, where a jury awarded Apple $1.05bn in damages after deciding a number of Samsung phones and tablets had infringed various software patents as well as mimicking the iPhone&apos;s appearance. Meanwhile in Japan, Apple lost a claim against Samsung, where it alleged similar infringements, providing a welcome relief for Samsung, which has had few outright wins in the dozens of cases being fought in courts around the world between the two. In February, Apple alleged in a US case in northern California that at least 17 Samsung products infringe its patents. In a court filing made in San Jose federal court on Friday, Apple added four more products to the list of allegedly infringing products that have been released since the beginning of August 2011. A ban on the Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note would be a publicity hit for Samsung, for which the phones are high-profile emblems of its ambitions. Samsung is said to be the world&apos;s largest maker of both smartphones and mobile phones, and the Note and S3 phones have been big sellers and revenue-earners. Following the Tokyo court decision, Samsung said in a statement it &quot;confirmed our long-held position that our products do not infringe Apple&apos;s intellectual property&quot;. A representative for Apple in Japan declined to comment. A spokesman for NTT Docomo Inc declined to comment, while a KDDI Corp spokeswoman said she did not see any major impact from the decision. Both Japanese mobile carriers sell the popular Samsung Galaxy series.",

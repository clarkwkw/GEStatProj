    "text": "I remember vividly my first night at university, the night I officially Moved Away From Home. A few hours earlier, my parents had helped bring up the last of my boxes (three flights of stairs, an out-of-order lift). We&apos;d said our overwrought goodbyes, made our promises to call every day and reassured one another that I was only an hour away by train. Then they left. I looked around, contemplated my new-found independence, and instantly threw myself into the fresher clich of decorating my bedroom with fairy lights, photos and scatter cushions. I was sure that some seismic shift had occurred that night. Something had changed forever and this was a new beginning, a new Moved-Away-From-Home beginning. Ten weeks of searching for bewilderingly numbered lecture rooms and nursing bouts of freshers&apos; flu later, I sat on my bed waiting for my parents to arrive to take me home for Christmas. Perhaps, I thought, as I looked around at my scatter cushions and fairy lights, I had misjudged this situation. Fast foward three days  mostly spent bickering with my parents about why I watch trashy television, what we&apos;re going to eat, when I want to use the shower, when I want to go out, how the piles of paper spread around the house in fact represent order rather than mess  and I knew that I had definitely misjudged it. A my-roof-my-rules life can be hard to face after so many weeks of a my-roof-leaks-so-there&apos;s-a-bucket-on-the-floor existence. Going home can feel like taking a step back in time to a life characterised by curfews and scolding and not eating beans out of the tin. On our own at university, we can truly Be Ourselves, forget every lesson our mothers tried to teach us before we left (&quot;check your eggs before you get to the till&quot;), and fall into some questionable habits. We spend weeks, months even, developing what we think are our own charming new idiosyncrasies  usually eccentric, often bizarre, sometimes disgusting  before we have to readjust, suddenly and jarringly, to a different routine at home. We discover that not everyone thinks eating biscuits on the sofa under a duvet is a delightful way to pass an afternoon. And after two or three of these cycles, a shift actually does take place. Home is no longer home. You may call it home, you may talk to your friends about &quot;going home at Easter&quot;, but it&apos;s not home in the true sense. Most of your stuff, minus a suitcase or two, is at university. Including, according to the old adage, the heart. There are some serious advantages to returning to the family homestead: unlimited hot water, home-cooked meals and parental affection, to name but three. Nevertheless, a time comes when you just can&apos;t wait to get back to university. It&apos;s certainly not the lectures or the submission deadlines that you&apos;re looking forward to, and neither is it really the friends or the nightlife. It&apos;s going back to your things, your place, your ways. Once you&apos;ve packed your life up into boxes and officially Flown The Nest, your home moves with you. And, as Thomas Wolfe wrote in his 1940 novel, You Can&apos;t Go Home Again.",

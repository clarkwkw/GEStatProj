    "text": "Years ago I had an Amstrad 8512 word processor with program that allowed one to scan the individual letters of one&apos;s handwriting, and turn letters into a font that could be used in Locoscript, Amstrad&apos;s resident word processor. Do you know of any similar program available for a PC (Windows XP), preferably free or at an affordable price?Peter Bann A lot of websites now offer services that convert your handwriting into a font. The process is usually the same: download a template and print it out, write characters in the lettered boxes, scan the resulting template, upload the scan to the website, and finally, download and install your font. If there&apos;s a choice, you will probably want a TrueType (TTF) font for Windows. Sites that offer this service include Kevin and Amanda&apos;s Fonts For Peas, YourFonts and MyScriptFont. However, Amanda publishes handwriting fonts and doesn&apos;t convert all the ones she is sent. (She doesn&apos;t like making &quot;old-fashioned cursive fonts&quot;.) FontCapture now goes to YourFonts, and while it&apos;s probably still free, the site obviously wants to sell you a font management program. Fontifier charges $9 (5.73) to download the font after you have seen a free preview, Writing Fonts charges $9.95, and HandFont charges $8.95. MyFirstFont has a tutorial that takes you through the process of making the font yourself.  The very popular Pilot Handwriting site isn&apos;t working for me at the moment and may have gone, though Pilot is obviously still in business making my favourite G2 and G-Tec-C4 pens. A business that&apos;s after a higher quality result could try Somerset-based Quantum Enterprises, which offers six services. A basic font generated using the usual online system costs 4.95, while its semi-automated Standard service (more suitable for cursive handwriting) costs 6.95. At the top of the range, however, it offers Premium and Premium Ultra services at prices up to 84.95. This includes manual editing of fonts based on analysing your real handwriting, not just writing characters in boxes. Looking up words in Microsoft Word     Word Search    Can you recommend any software that provides a spell check facility on Word documents, that also includes definitions of each option? In a hurry, it is all too easy to grab the wrong correction for a spelling when you are only presented with a list of words. Babylon translation software displays word options with definitions, but it is not reliable.Gill GeddesOne of the least-known features of Microsoft Word is that it has had a dictionary and thesaurus look-up service built in since Word 2003. It&apos;s very easy to use: you just hold down the Alt key while mouse-clicking the word you want to look up. This will open a Research Pane to the right of your document, with entries from several sources. These include Microsoft&apos;s Encarta Dictionary and an English language thesaurus, but you can select from a range of offerings.  A slower alternative to Alt-clicking is to right-click a word and select Look Up from the drop-down menu. The problem is that all the reference books and website resources are online, not stored on your PC. Even if you restrict the look-up to Encarta Dictionary, it takes a second or two to fetch the result. This is bearable if you only want to look up the odd word from time to time, but not if you want definitions for everything. Instead, your best option is probably WordWeb, which is described as: &quot;A comprehensive one-click English thesaurus and dictionary for Windows. It can be used to look up words from almost any program, showing definitions, synonyms and related words. It includes pronunciations and usage examples, and has helpful spelling and sounds-like links.&quot; There are also WordWeb apps for Apple&apos;s iPhone and iPad and for Android devices. WordWeb 6.8 is free for modern versions of Windows (from Windows 2000 onwards). There is also a more powerful WordWeb Pro version for 14. To this you can add extra word-lists and the Oxford Dictionary of English (19), the Chambers Dictionary and Thesaurus (19) or the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (35).  WordWeb lets you look up words in Microsoft Word and other applications by holding down the Control key and right-clicking on the word. It&apos;s as close as I can find to the Command-Control-D dictionary/thesaurus look-up that&apos;s built into Mac OS X. Since WordWeb is on your hard drive and runs from the SysTray in the Windows TaskBar, it&apos;s faster than using Word&apos;s Research Pane. Annoying mouse-overs I&apos;ve noticed recently an increase in underlined words in news articles that, when you hover the mouse over them, open up a box to entice you into buying something, entering a draw, doing a survey etc. I use Firefox on Windows 7. Is there any way to disable them?Laurie These popups are usually called &quot;mouse-overs&quot;, and because they are built into web pages, they can be hard to disable. However, as a Firefox user, you may be able to block most of them by using the NoScript add-on. If it doesn&apos;t work on a particular site, trying making it an untrusted website. I don&apos;t know of anything as good for other browsers, but the Kill Evil extension for Google Chrome, which I have not tried, says it &quot;mercilessly removes&quot; all sorts of annoying web tricks. Most of us probably just keep the mouse pointer away from underlined words, but perhaps Ask Jack readers can suggest other options. Link phishing? I have recently received two emails that seem to be part of some automated phishing initiative. I am not sure what they are trying to achieve, or where I can report this. I am sharing this because it is plausible, but it is clearly deceptive and therefore has a dishonest intention.Nigel Lloyd Both of the emails start with the words &quot;I am curious if you are the person responsible for adding content&quot; to a specified web page, and a Google search shows that lots of people have received similar emails. They are probably related to SEO (search engine optimisation). Specifically, they appear to be an attempt to get links from reputable websites to the senders&apos; content farms. These backlinks would get them a higher rank in Google, and help them make more money from advertising. As web scams go, it seems relatively harmless, and not worth reporting, even if we could think who to report it to. Of course, even if you don&apos;t provide a link, or possibly some free content, replying to these emails might get you added to the databases of live addresses used by spammers.",

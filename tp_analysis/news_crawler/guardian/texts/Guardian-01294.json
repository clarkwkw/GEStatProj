    "text": "The dangers which Peter Wilby pointsout (Does Gove realise he is empowering future dictators?, 31 January) were recognised 70 years ago. Unfortunately secretaries of state know very little history. The Oxford historian Dr Marjorie Reeves, when invited to be on the Central Advisory Council For Education (England) in 1946, was told by the permanent secretary, John Redcliffe-Maud, that the main duty of council members was &quot;to be prepared to die at the first ditch as soon as politicians try to get their handson education&quot;. A war had been fought to prevent the consequences of such concentrated power. The 1944 Education Act, hammered out during the war years, created a &quot;maintained system&quot; of education as a balance of power between central government, local government responsibility, the voluntary bodies (mainly the churches) and the teachers. That balance is now disappearing fast, without the public debate it needs and with hardly a squeak from Labour. The existing education legislation refers to the fast-disappearing &quot;maintained schools&quot;, leaving academies and free schools exposed, without the protection of the law, to whatever whimsical ideas are dreamt up by the present or future secretaries of state, to whom they are contracted with minimal accountability to parliament.Professor Richard PringGreen Templeton College, Oxford  The removal of 3,100 vocational subjects from the school performance tables from 2014 (Report, 31 January) has major implications. It is certainly the case that &quot;perverse incentives&quot; were created by the league tables to use soft options to boost school league table positions  the phenomenon known as gaming. However, the cull to 70 accepted vocational subjects, with 55 allowed on the margins, essentially destroys vocational and technical education. Given that the old basis is the one for the current (2012 and 2013) tables, a whole raft of students are on worthless courses. The wider implication is that the government has no interest in vocational or technical education. However, there is a subtext that Mr Gove&apos;s supporters may find less palatable. The schools that have used gaming most cynically have been academies. Indeed, take away 16-plus exam results and the academies are the least successful schools in the country  they had 7% of students gaining Ebacc last year against 13%of comprehensive students.Trevor FisherStafford  While some courses don&apos;t stand up to scrutiny, others have the potential to form the bedrock of future UK prosperity. The JCB Academy in Rocester is doing ground-breaking work inspiring young people from Derby and its environs to major in engineering and business skills. It was set up to provide future skilled employees for companies like Rolls-Royce, Toyota and, of course, JCB itself, as these companies have found that young people are not being given the necessary skills and experience in mainstream schools and colleges. Is it too late for Michael Gove to recognise excellence where it exists, and stop tarring all non-mainstream courses with the same brush?Lucy CareDerby Let&apos;s be clear about the pupils at Mossbourne Community Academy (Wilshaw&apos;s rules, 24 January). Far from being &quot;well-heeled&quot;, 89% of the pupils  according to IDACI data from the 2011 school census  fall within the 20% most deprived in the country. Almost 40% of last year&apos;s GCSE cohort were on free school meals, yet 76% of these disadvantaged pupils achieved five or more A*-C grades at GCSE including English and maths. For too long commentators have implied that Mossbourne&apos;s intake is predominantly of privileged, middle-class children. This is simply not true. The Pembury estate, next door to Mossbourne, is one of the capital&apos;s most deprived housing estates. Mossbourne is not alone in achieving outstanding results for a truly comprehensive intake. You need only look at neighbouring schools, like Bethnal Green technology college in Tower Hamlets, where results compare well.Alan WoodDirector of children services, Hackney  According to Susanna Rustin: &quot;Even those community schools that have hung on to comprehensive status and stuck with their local authority rather than striking out as independents, have mostly reintroduced uniforms, streaming and head boys and girls&quot; (Nostalgia for grammar schools is misplaced, 30 January). At Millom School, where I am chair of governors, we have very recently dispensed with the role of head boy and girl, never condoned streaming and remodelled our school uniform (no blazers, no ties, no braid) in the light of students&apos; preferences. We have also twice decided not to seek academy status. Neither nostalgia nor political opportunism has informed our decisions. We are not alone. Hopefully Susanna would approve?Professor Colin RichardsSpark Bridge, Cumbria I am concerned about the decision to axe in excess of 3,000 GCSEs without appearing to consider the implications on the young people that benefit from such diversity of qualifications. Every child has the right to succeed. Success breeds success and consequently such a decision could affect people&apos;s learning drive. One size does not fit all and I would ask the education minister to consult widely before making decisions that may backfire on our communities. Firstly, and speaking as a principal of an academy whose attainment has grown over five consecutive years, it is important to recognise that a wide range of suitable qualifications are important to ensure we meet our learners&apos; needs. I think it is important to state that a good grade in a traditional GCSE should quite rightly remain a priority. However, it should also be recognised that passing an alternative vocational qualification is of a higher value to a young person than achieving a D or below in any GCSE. It is important therefore to get the right balance. League tables simply drive behaviour based on wherever the emphasis is, but to date we have yet to find a way of securing accountability through league tables that also recognises the outstanding work that schools are doing to meet the needs of all of their learners. Secondly, consider those returning to education of any age, which has been encouraged by successive governments. The eradication of so many GCSEs has the potential to create a chasm for people who are in this category. We cannot afford for this to happen as this is part of &quot;building communities&quot;. Let us not wipe out these courses without widespread consultation with people whose feet are firmly on the ground, and who work at the coalface.Kevin RowlandsPrincipal, Oasis Academy, Immingham Alison Wolf suggests that &quot;Institutions are under great pressure to do well in league tables&quot; (Let&apos;s end qualifications that have no value, 31 January) and Michael Gove has now reduced the number of vocational qualifications from over 3,000 to 135. The effects of this on pupils, teachers, employers and society will be extremely negative and confine pupils to courses for which they are not suited, frustrate teachers for having to offer courses that are not appropriate and deny employers future workers with job-related skills  and poor old society will have to pick up the tab for out-of-work, disillusioned young people. An easier solution would have been to do away with league tables and let professionals do their work without government interference. Simple really.Bob DawsonBury, Lancashire",

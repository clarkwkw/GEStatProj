    "text": "In July 2013, a large, strangely shaped beetle emerged from the fabric of a wooden chair that had just been bought in the UK. The inch-long creature had developed inside the chairs wooden frame before it ate its way to the surface and burst through the seats plastic covering  much to the alarm of its purchaser. Crucially, the furniture had been made in, and imported from, China. Analysis by Fera Science, formerly the Food and Environment Research Agency, showed the beetle was a Japanese pine sawyer. Worse, the beetle was found to be infested with a second serious pest: the pinewood nematode worm. In combination, the beetle (Monochamus alternatus) and worm (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) have been linked to widespread damage to pine forests in China and Japan. Now it is spreading through parts of Europe. In this case, the invaders were destroyed after staff at Fera Science traced the chair and destroyed several other contaminated items of furniture from the same consignment. But the warning was clear. Britain and its trees are coming under increasing pressure from a range of foreign pathogens, a point underlined last week when scientists revealed that the horse chestnut tree was now being threatened by a different invader  the leaf miner moth, which has spread through England and Wales, and was recently discovered in Scotland. The leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) does not kill conkers directly but leaves trees weakened, while their seeds are small and shrivelled. Younger trees are killed off, and mature trees are left susceptible to deadly diseases such as bleeding canker. The threat to the British landscape is one of the worst since Dutch elm disease wiped out millions of trees in the 1970s. It includes ash dieback (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus), which is caused by a fungus that quickly kills young ash trees, and older trees more slowly. Scientists have warned that the fungal spores spread so easily that the disease could eventually wipe out the UKs estimated 80million ashes, one of our commonest trees.

There is no doubt that the threat from foreign pathogens to our trees is growing, said Professor Rick Mumford, a scientist at Fera Science. You can see a clear trend. More and more are appearing, and dealing with them is getting harder and harder. Climate change, which is warming Britain and making it more hospitable to many foreign insects and pests, is a factor. But Mumford was emphatic that the most common way invaders are getting into Britain and infecting our trees is through imported wood. This is often for packaging, and very frequently originates in China. The volume of wood sent as packaging or as items such as furniture is vast, he added. One example of this dangerous influx is provided by several dozen trees that were found, in 2012, to be infested by the Asian longhorn beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) in Paddock Wood, Kent. More than 250 live larvae were discovered. Crucially, Forestry Commission experts said they believed the beetles  a threat to sycamore, ash, birch, willow, poplar and some fruit trees  had emerged from wood packaging used to import slate from China to a site near the outbreak. Thousands of trees in Paddock Wood had to be cut down to contain the outbreak. In that case, the wooden packaging, rather than the goods inside, was to blame. In the case of the Japanese pine sawyer beetle it was the product itself  a chair  that was infected. Joe Ostoj-Starzewski of Fera, writing in an article Imported furniture  a pathway for the introduction of plant pests in the bulletin of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation, said large volumes of chairs of a construction similar to those found to be infested with the beetle are now being brought into the UK. In 2012-13, 84,000 such chairs were imported. This trade clearly offers a pathway with the potential for multiple and widespread introductions of wood inhabiting pests, Ostoja-Starzewski wrote. Mumford agreed. Wood goods and packaging should be treated so they do not carry pathogens, but clearly this process is not being enforced as strictly as it should be in some cases, he said.   Related: With 90% of the UKs ash trees about to be wiped out, could GM be the answer?    This point was acknowledged by Nicola Spence, chief plant health officer of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Increasing global trade does mean that our plants face increased threat from the spread of pests and diseases, she said. We cant eliminate all risks but we have stringent plans to deal with threats, and take prompt action should they be detected. We work closely with neighbouring countries, the wider international community as well as industry, NGOs, landowners and the public to reduce the risks of pests and diseases entering the country. We are also working to build the resilience of our trees and plants  this helps to mitigate the impact of pests that have already arrived. From 2012 to 2019 we will have invested more than 37m into tree health research. Nor is the situation universally gloomy for already infected trees. In the case of ash dieback, some trees have been found to be resistant, with UK trees proving to be particularly resilient. That does offer hope that we could one day regenerate the ash, added Mumford. KILLER INSECTS  The leaf miner moth (Cameraria ohridella) kills young conker trees and makes mature trees susceptible to deadly diseases such as bleeding canker.  Japanese pine sawyer beetle (Monochamus alternatus) and pinewood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) have caused widespread damage to Asian pine forests.  The Asian longhorn beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) is a threat to sycamore, ash, birch, willow, poplar and some fruit trees.",

    "text": "President Barack Obama warned Saturday that American cars and trucks must be weaned off oil for good if drivers are to avoid spikes in gas prices. Touting a $200m-a-year funding boost for research into clean fuel cars, the president used his weekly radio address to reaffirm his belief in an &quot;all-of-the-above&quot; strategy if the US is to become energy self-sufficient. The move comes amid increasing pressure on Obama from environmentalists, left disappointed by the perceived lack of action during his first term in the White House and angered over the prospect of a green light for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. As part of the solution to America&apos;s need to reduce its dependence on overseas oil, Obama fleshed out details over the establishment of an Energy Security Trust, which would direct revenue from offshore oil and gas development into clean energy research. The plan was pushed by the president during a visit to the Argonne research labs, near Chicago on Friday. Attacked by some as an insufficient response to the needs to address climate change, Obama defended the move as a cost-neutral proposal that would benefit the public. During his national radio address, the president also reiterated his belief that a move to cleaner fuel driving could see the end of gas-guzzlers dominating America&apos;s roads, and save motorists money in the process. &quot;The only way we&apos;re going to break this cycle of spiking gas prices for good is to shift our cars and trucks off of oil for good.&quot; He added that an &quot;all-of-the-above&quot;  in which research for green energy was coupled with more oil and gas production at home  was the best way to achieve the goal of energy self-sufficiency.",

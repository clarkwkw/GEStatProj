    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view The last two BioShocks took place in the gloom of leaky undersea dystopia, Rapture. This one&apos;s set in Columbia, a shining steampunk city in the clouds, where evil messianic Father Comstock has imprisoned Elizabeth, a girl with strange powers. Naturally, you&apos;re there to perform the jail break. As well as all the sunshine and open space, this differs from past outings in that Columbia isn&apos;t derelict; it&apos;s well populated, complete with a police force and military to foil your plans. The game&apos;s alternate realities, invoked in your attempts to escape, cause added destruction; while gunfights are fast and dangerous, with a fine balance between guns and vigors, the game&apos;s version of magic. The plot, with its shifting timelines and themes of religious zealotry and racism, also has a wonderfully twisted conclusion; it&apos;s potent, compelling and fun.",

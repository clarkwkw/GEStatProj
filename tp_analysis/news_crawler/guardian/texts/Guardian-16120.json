    "text": "   Photograph: Dr Yin Wu    Many have asked how I managed to complete a self-funded PhD, and I tell them it is down to three crucial elements; a good work ethic, determination and support networks from friends and family. But more importantly, you must love your research subject. In 2006 I declined a banking job offer to pursue a PhD in human geography at University College London because of my passion for research. My thesis examined Hong Kong&apos;s society through the emerging wine industry and alcohol consumption practices. It also addressed the cultural differences between mainland China, Hong Kong and the West. The bigger picture For those considering doing a PhD, especially a self-funded one, it is essential to think about how the PhD can fit into the bigger picture of your life as you are likely to delay your career development and sacrifice aspects of your social and family life. Unlike a fully funded student, I had to pay for my fees and living expenses through taking on a number of jobs. At one point, I had three jobs while simultaneously working on the thesis. This was obviously a challenge, but the experience I obtained and the people whom I met were invaluable. The commercial skills that I acquired from working for a corporate firm in London helped me to execute the business aspect of my research in Hong Kong. I also ran gifted and talented education projects at Queen Mary University of London. The job gave me the opportunity to inspire young people from challenging backgrounds to get into Russell Group universities. This experience made me realised how fortunate I was to be studying at one of the best institutions in the world. In addition, I took on other jobs at UCL, including giving lectures in my department, photographing various events as well as working for other departments. It is possible to do all this as long as you are willing to work hard and be organised. At a later stage of my PhD I secured some funding from the UCL graduate school and department of geography. The amount was far from a full studentship, but I&apos;m grateful for their financial contribution. Having that support allowed me to work less and focus more on my research. Knowing how much easier it is to do a PhD with funding, I still witnessed fully funded students fail to finish within the four-year timeframe, with some dropping out completely. The greatest factor to success is not financial but good old fashioned determination. Creating new opportunities Studying at a global university also created social opportunities. I have developed friendships with a number of inspiring international individuals. Two marriages in my department have taken me to Morocco and Mauritius. My friends outside academia also supported me in other ways. One generous restaurant owner and old friend sponsored me with ducks, noodles and chicken feet. Others helped me to shape my research ideas. There are also those exceptional individuals who made those seemingly endless days and nights not so endless. They all, in their own way, occupy a special place in my mind. Sadly, my father passed away during my PhD journey but I used his departure as a form of encouragement to guide me through until the end. My family also played an important role because they have always been there for me. It took me a bit longer to complete the thesis but it is done. Motivation is a must It is a tough process doing a PhD regardless of funding, but you learn to turn uncertainties into opportunities and ignore irrelevant events and relationships that don&apos;t contribute to your wider narrative. You must be motivated. What drove me to finish the PhD was to provide research which had not been conducted. My research shows that Hong Kong citizens use wine consumption as a means to negotiate a phase of change, and this change is based on the transition from the old Hong Kong, ruled by the British, to the new one, which is being ruled by mainland China. My advice is that if you want to do a self-funded PhD, be prepared for the harsh realities of working three jobs, physical exhaustion and social isolation. One friend recently asked: &quot;Is there a way to fast track a PhD?&quot; I responded, &quot;Yes, you do 13-hour days in the library with three 15-minute triple espresso breaks in between.&quot; Do this and you will be buzzing, half with ideas, half with caffeine poisoning.

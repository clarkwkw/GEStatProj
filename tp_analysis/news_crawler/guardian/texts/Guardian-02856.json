    "text": "Feeling credulous? Step right up to The Pirate Bay&apos;s latest blogpost, then, and read on:   We were down a few hours earlier today. There&apos;s no need to worry, we haven&apos;t been raided this time. We&apos;re only upgrading stuff since we&apos;re still growing. One of the technical things we always optimize is where to put our front machines. They are the ones that re-direct your traffic to a secret location. We have now decided to try to build something extraordinary. With the development of GPS controlled drones, far-reaching cheap radio equipment and tiny new computers like the Raspberry Pi, we&apos;re going to experiment with sending out some small drones that will float some kilometers up in the air. This way our machines will have to be shut down with aeroplanes in order to shut down the system. A real act of war. We&apos;re just starting so we haven&apos;t figured everything out yet. But we can&apos;t limit ourselves to hosting things just on land anymore. These Low Orbit Server Stations (LOSS) are just the first attempt. With modern radio transmitters we can get over 100Mbps per node up to 50km away. For the proxy system we&apos;re building, that&apos;s more than enough.  (There&apos;s a bit more, but we don&apos;t want to deter anyone from clicking through.) Link me up OK, so let&apos;s see if we can find any holes in this idea. Because obviously we&apos;d like nothing but the most resilient system for TPB.  &quot;we&apos;re going to experiment with sending out some small drones that will float some kilometers up in the air&quot;  Hmm. Onboard computer with uplink and downlink. That will have to be pretty precisely aligned to a ground transponder, unless it&apos;s going to be broadcasting to the world at large. Except if it&apos;s going to broadcast to the world at large, BSkyB-style, then it would need to be pretty large. So really it would need to connect to a ground terminal. On the ground, obviously. (If you need a quick explanation of how satellite internet - which this basically is - works, then see this page from How Stuff Works.) So there&apos;s your first point of weakness in this plan: you need to have some connections on the ground. Quite expensive satellite ones, actually, unless you happen to have people hanging around who are good at setting up high-speed wide-bandwidth connections for nothing. TPB is quite popular, even though it isn&apos;t actually hosting anything much now because of its shift to &quot;magnet&quot; files rather than torrents.  Now, it&apos;s quite easy to hide your ground-based uplink sites if your satellite - sorry, drone (we&apos;ll come to that) is only connecting to a ground uplink/downlink. You can have them on the roof of a building, and just connect to them; if the beam from the satellite is tight, then it won&apos;t leak appreciably and you&apos;ll be happy. But if you need a tight connection, then you can&apos;t float your satellite connection from a balloon - it&apos;ll get blown around too much. Hence the drone. Probably not going to fly OK, let&apos;s deal with the drone stuff now.  &quot;we&apos;re going to experiment with sending out some small drones that will float some kilometers up in the air&quot;  No, you&apos;re probably not. Civil aviation authorities tend to get itchy about objects floating around in airspace at the sort of altitudes - a few kilometres up - where civil aircraft might whack into them. If your flying objects are going to be airborne for any length of time (which TPB implies here) then you need to tell the aviation authority, because causing a calamity in which an aircraft has to take avoiding action (or, even worse, crash-lands) is the sort of thing that easily leads to prison sentences. (There&apos;s no point for TPB having a drone that isn&apos;t miles up in the sky; it can&apos;t connect enough points to act as a useful server.) But even if we accept the idea that TPB will put some drones up, there are still two more problems: duration, and connection. Duration first. UAV (Uncrewed Airborne Vehicles) are a relatively new technology, and they face the problem that anything which wants to fly does: how to stay up there. Even the US Army, which has been putting lots of money into UAVs, can&apos;t keep them up there indefinitely. The Wikipedia page on UAVs suggests that the best that any known device has managed is around 14 days - although more typically they manage two days or less. While a Raspberry Pi is a very light payload, it still has some weight, and don&apos;t forget that you&apos;re also looking at your uplink/downlink systems and the associated demand on the batteries to run those. Likely, the drones are going to have to come out of the air every few days or so, which means recharging while a replacement is flying, and all the associated maintenance. And then there&apos;s the question of connection. If we assume for the minute that the TPB drones are going to be using a narrow-beam for uplink/downlink (so that their ground stations don&apos;t become the target of businesses which don&apos;t like their business) then the drone is going to have to be able to maintain a very, very precise location despite being a few kilometres up. That&apos;s quite difficult, though not impossible; it just means that you need to have excellent electronics and very good position control, which in turn means more energy spent maintaining position. Yes, the US Army manages this just fine, but it has a slightly bigger budget than TPB. Finally, the other question is: what&apos;s the point of doing all this again? If TPB really wanted to have its servers out of the visibility of governments, then it could simply get them hosted via Cloudflare, which has become the host of choice for both big companies and small hackers. If its ground-based servers are too unreliable, why does it think that putting them a few kilometres up, where the temperature will be below the standard operating temperature for the kit, is going to improve things? That hasn&apos;t stopped an excited tide of commenters delighted at the idea on TPB, despite not having thought through quite how it would or would not work. Well, apart from one who only identifies himself as &quot;dom9360&quot;:  You (the audience) are either stupid or gullible. This will not happen anytime soon in a usable state. And, if it does, where do you think the non-wired drone communicates back to? Not only the directions but the actual shit found on here. The Internet is primarily a wired infrastructure. Some entity that is ground based will need to be tapped. So, how is this adding any benefit to the current situation? One does not need to disable the drone; rather, all that is needed is to disable the provider at ground. Looks like April came early.  Have to say that we agree. It&apos;s not a workable plan within the budget or technology of TPB, and won&apos;t be for a very long time - and there will be better systems long before that. (Even using Magnet files is a better solution on its own.) We&apos;re only guessing, but we think that sound you hear from TPB might be sniggering.",

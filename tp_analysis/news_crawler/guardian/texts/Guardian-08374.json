    "text": "GCHQ, the government&apos;s electronic intelligence-gathering centre, is to encourage members of the public to help combat the growing threat of cyber-attacks by testing their skills and applying to join the once-secret Cheltenham-based agency. A GCHQ official, identified only as Karl, has designed a competition to protect a simulated government computer system from online crime. &quot;There is no such thing as a completely secure system  businesses will always need to balance where to spend a limited budget, to manage risks and provide opportunities,&quot; he said. The competition will test the skills of people tasked with preventing attacks from hostile states, organised criminal cyber gangs, or individual hackers. The competition is being run in conjunction with Cyber Security Challenge UK. Earlier this month GCHQ warned the chief executives of Britain&apos;s biggest companies about an unprecedented threat from cyber-attacks. Intelligence agencies for the first time confronted senior private sector company figures over their failure to protect their businesses from cyber threats to their personal data, online services and intellectual property. &quot;GCHQ now sees real and credible threats to cybersecurity of an unprecedented scale, diversity, and complexity,&quot; said Iain Lobban, the agency&apos;s director. GCHQ has warned the parliamentary intelligence and security committee of a shortage of skilled recruits to combat cyber-attacks.",

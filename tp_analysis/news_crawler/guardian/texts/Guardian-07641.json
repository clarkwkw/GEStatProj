    "text": "The number of students getting top grades in their A-levels in Northern Ireland has fallen for the second year in a row. This year almost 32% of students achieved A* or A grades in their exams, compared with 34.5% last year. Education experts point out that the fall in those hitting the highest grades is down to a broader range of people staying on at school and taking the exams. Anne Marie Duffy, director of qualifications at Northern Ireland&apos;s awarding body, said: &quot;Over time results can fluctuate and this year we have seen a small decrease in the percentage of entries gaining the top grades. &quot;This is in line with expectations, based on predicted performance for this group of students, and their performance in last year&apos;s GCE AS-level exams.&quot; Meanwhile, pressure for places at Northern Ireland&apos;s universities this coming term has reached record levels. More than 8,000 local students will miss out on a place at Queen&apos;s University Belfast and the University of Ulster due to a record number of applications. Around 17,000 students applied to study at the two universities but between them they have only 8,133 places. The pressure on applicants has intensified because around 2,000 students from the UK and the EU have applied to the universities, where the tuition fees of 3,465 are cheaper than those in Britain.",

    "headline": "Green deal would see home insulation rate plummet", 
    "text": "The government&apos;s flagship green policy to transform the energy efficiency of 14m homes and create 65,000 jobs appears set for failure, after revelation that its own impact assessment shows the number of lofts being lagged per year will plummet by 83%. The green deal is at the heart of the government&apos;s ambition to be the &quot;greenest ever&quot; as it will deliver large cuts in climate-warming carbon emissions, and curb high energy bills by making houses warmer and less expensive to heat. It is due to begin in the autumn. Britain&apos;s homes are old and leaky by international standards and millions of lofts and cavity walls remain poorly insulated. These home energy efficiency measures are seen as the cheapest way to cut both energy bills and carbon emissions. Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, announced changes to the policy on Monday, prompted by criticism that take-up of the green deal loans would be low. But the updated impact assessment for the new policy still shows loft and cavity wall insulations dropping dramatically under the green deal. The government&apos;s assessment predicts that the number of loft insulations will fall from about 900,000 in 2012 to 150,000 in 2013, a fall of 83%. That is an improvement on the figures issued in the initial impact assessment, which predicted a 93% fall. But the rate of loft insulation remains vastly lower than the 2.1 million per year which the government&apos;s official advisers, the committee on climate change is required for the UK to meet its climate change targets. Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) statistics show that 10 million (43%) of all lofts remain inadequately unlagged and 8 million houses with cavity walls (42%) have yet to be insulated. The number of cavity walls being insulated is also predicted to fall, from about 700,000 in 2012 to 400,000 in 2013, a fall of 43%. The initial impact assessment predicted a 67% fall. But, again, the rate of cavity wall insulation is much lower than the 1.4 million per year that the CCC say is needed. &quot;The loft and cavity insulation industry has benefitted from government subsidies for many years, with the costs borne by bill payers,&quot; a Decc spokesman said. He pointed to the availability of green deal loans for these measures, under which the repayments needed should be less than the energy bill savings delivered by the insulation. &quot;There is far less need to continue subsidising them. &quot;By the end of the 2012, around 60% of lofts will be fully insulated and only around 200,000 lofts will be left with no insulation at all. It is therefore inevitable that the number of loft insulations being delivered will fall,&quot; he said. However, critics say low take-up for the new green deal loans show how reluctant homeowners can be to clearing their lofts and having workmen in their houses. The schemes being replaced by the green deal placed a legal obligation on energy companies to deliver a certain number of insulations per year, but the companies often had to resort to paying customers to persuade them to allow the work to be done. The slight reduction in the predicted falls in loft and cavity wall insulation comes after Decc &quot;listened carefully to industry concerns about potential cliff edges&quot;. The changes result from allowing some additional lofts and cavity walls in low-income areas to become eligible for the new, smaller, obligation scheme called Eco (energy company obligation). &quot;Despite all the criticism the green deal has received, ministers have refused to listen and the scheme remains riddled with problems,&quot; said Labour&apos;s Luciana Berger MP, a shadow Decc minister. &quot;It is crazy that the government is pressing ahead with proposals which their own figures show will be a disaster for hundreds of small insulation businesses across the country and will risk thousands of jobs.&quot; The CCC made an unprecedented intervention in December when it warned Decc that the green deal would reach only 2-3 million households of the 14 million targeted. &quot;The [green deal] proposal is to take away existing obligations and say &apos;let&apos;s leave it to the market&apos;,&quot; said David Kennedy, the CCC chief executive. &quot;We think there is a significant risk in leaving it to the market, as that has never worked anywhere in the world and is unlikely to happen in the UK. We are talking about the transformation of the entire building stock of this country.&quot; The Decc spokesman said: &quot;We have limited resources and we therefore have to make choices. Continuing to subsidise affordable measures such as lofts and cavity walls at current levels through Eco ... could [have] severe implications for consumer bills. Public subsidy must be targeted where it is needed most.&quot; The government had already announced a 200m fund to help incentivise take-up and other measures that have been discussed include cashback offers, council tax or stamp duty rebates. A proposal to change building regulations so that people who renovate their homes improve its energy efficiency at the same time was killed off by David Cameron after being, incorrectly, dubbed the &quot;conservatory tax&quot;. The CBI&apos;s Rhian Kelly said: &quot;Having more details on how the green deal will operate on a practical level is an important step for a scheme that has the very real potential to cut costs for consumers and businesses. However, there is still plenty of work to do and the government needs to move quickly. It must ensure that businesses who want to get involved are in the best position to do so and put the right policies in place to stimulate consumer demand.&quot;",

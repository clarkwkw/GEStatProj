    "text": "Comprising spruced-up versions of three &quot;tactical espionage&quot; classics, this collection is nothing if not a value proposition. Things kick off with 2001&apos;s MGS2, less a sequel than a postmodern meta-commentary on the game that preceded it (which, strangely, isn&apos;t included here). It&apos;s showing its age, but remains entertainingly audacious. The brilliant MGS3 pits the player against a cadre of psychologically damaged mercenaries and contains some of the most absorbing, ingenious and emotionally draining boss encounters ever designed. Then there&apos;s Peace Walker. Originally a hand-held game, it doles the action out in bus-ride-sized chunks and adds a surprisingly rewarding layer of RPG-style personnel management, plus a neat multiplayer mode. All three shine in HD, with the higher resolution serving to foreground all those little touches  from cartoon frogs to pregnant commandos&apos; underarm hair  that make the series special. In short, a pretty stellar package.",

    "text": "By suggesting (Report, 12 January) that the National Trust had some sort of &quot;secret shopping list&quot;, you have confused the regular disposal of Forestry Commission land with the government&apos;s proposals for the entire forestry estate in England. It is perfectly true that we have acquired parcels of land from the Forestry Commission in the past. In previous years, the commission spoke to us and other land-owning organisations about their annual plans for straightforward disposals of small parts of their estate. This was a perfectly normal and regular occurrence. The extent of the government&apos;s proposals to sell off Forestry Commission sites in England, as revealed in January 2011, took many of us in the NGO sector by complete surprise and indeed raised serious concerns, which we voiced very clearly. We welcomed the decision to end the consultation and enter a period of deeper reflection about the role of forests and the future of the public forest estate.Peter NixonDirector of conservation, National Trust",

    "text": "It&apos;s the third Monday in January, the one the media love to call Blue Monday, &quot;the most depressing day of the year&quot;. Retailers love it too. Topshop is currently urging us to &quot;banish those blues&quot; by splashing out on a skirt. I&apos;m a big fan of retail therapy but even I can see that&apos;s not going to work for everyone. Though wouldn&apos;t it be nice if depression was solved by a new skirt with an added 10% NUS discount.     blue monday equation Photograph: guardian.co.uk    The date of Blue Monday  this year it falls on the 21st, slap bang in the middle of the January exam period  was originally mooted by one Cliff Arnall. His &quot;equation&quot; contains six factors - debt (d), time since Christmas (T), weather (W), low motivational levels (M), the feeling of a need to take action (Na) and time since failing our new year&apos;s resolutions (Q). Arnall&apos;s formula infuriates those who object to the subject of depression being trivialised. Dean Burnett from Cardiff University believes the media hype around these few 24 hours is harmful, not helpful. It&apos;s &quot;disrespectful to those who suffer from genuine depression, suggesting that it is temporary, minor and experienced by everyone, rather than what may be a chronic and incapacitating condition&quot;, he says. Of course some of Arnall&apos;s factors are indeed classic contributors to feeling low in general, not just today. Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD, is a form of depression caused by the weather, and is thought to affect millions of people in the UK. UEA student Rosie is one of them: &quot;The hardest thing is dragging myself out of bed in the morning, especially when it&apos;s still dark and miserable outside. Having a light box, and sitting in front of that before having to face the day really helps.&quot; Light treatment stimulates change in the body&apos;s mood chemicals: melatonin and serotonin. But often depression cannot attributed to specific factors, and those feeling down have no idea why they feel that way. The student support website Students Against Depression says economic problems are the &quot;most significant factor in triggering depression at university&quot;. Although this month&apos;s fresh student loan instalment may bring many back into the black, for some it is a further reminder of their accumulating debt. For first-years, January marks the end of the honeymoon period, with essay deadlines and exam periods piling up. For second- and third-year students, the fact that all marks now contribute to your degree weighs heavily on the mind. Leaving the cosiness of home and returning to university doesn&apos;t feel as exciting in January as it did in September. January can be a very dark, blue month. &quot;You come back from home, all well-fed, warm and comforted, and you have to wade through revision up to your eyeballs, spending most of your time trying to find a seat in an overcrowded library,&quot; says Lizzy from Nottingham University. Emma, at Sheffield, agrees: &quot;January is stressful. The family gathering at Christmas ends and you&apos;re faced with the prospect of life-changing exams while trying to keep healthy and active, as everyone keeps telling you you must. It&apos;s the worst month of the year, as a student.&quot; So how do you find help? Remember that friends, and even family, have probably experienced similar feelings at some point in their life. Depression is a lot more common than most people think. Tell them how you&apos;re feeling  they&apos;ll understand. Most universities offer more structured support. Sheffield University, for example, has a confidential counselling department, with one-to-one and group sessions, to help students cope with a range of issues including exam anxiety, homesickness and relationship troubles. If you&apos;d prefer to remain completely anonymous, then Nightline, a listening and emotional support hotline specifically for students, could be an option. Volunteers have been delivering the service for over four decades. Most of all, you need to find someone who understands that depression can&apos;t be solved by a simple equation and, unlike Blue Monday, doesn&apos;t just come once a year.",

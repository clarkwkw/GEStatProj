    "text": "Once the entry period has closed, categories will be assigned to groups of judges, with each judge allocated up to three categories, relevant to their role and experiences.  The long listed entries for each category will be sent out to the judges who will then score each entry based on the specific category criteria and the more general criteria, and then return the scores to us.  The judging lunch will then take place in early December where all the judges will come together to deliberate over the entries and decide a winner and two runners-up. The shortlist will then be announced and published on the Guardian Higher Education Network and the winners announced at the awards ceremony, which will take place at Senate House, London on 27 February 2013. If you have any questions about the judging process please do not hesitate to contact us using the details available here.",

    "text": "Brighton and Hove, Coventry, Salford and Aberdeen are among 12 cities that will share 50m of funding for ultrafast broadband and public Wi-Fi, George Osborne has announced. Alongside a new deadline for awarding rural broadband contracts, the chancellor listed in his autumn statement the places that will receive the super-connected cities grants first announced in the spring 2012 budget. The others are Cambridge, Derby, Oxford, Portsmouth and York in England; Perth in Scotland; Newport in Wales and Derry in Northern Ireland. The latest grants are a second wave of investment, following a 100m grant to improve broadband and public wireless services in a first tranche for 10 UK cities. &quot;We urge the government to allocate these funds via a fair and open process that is accessible to those companies that have proven they can efficiently implement fibre technology regardless of their size,&quot; said Dana Tobak, managing director of fibre broadband firm Hyperoptic. The projects are part of a national infrastructure plan which has involved an average rise in annual public spending from 29bn between 2005 to 2010, to 33bn between 2010 and 2012. Osborne also set a new deadline for the delayed Broadband Development UK programme, which involves distributing 530m of grants to ensure universal broadband coverage and high-speed access for 90% of premises. Contracts for the work from local councils were originally due to be awarded by the end of this year, but procurement will now complete in &quot;summer 2013&quot;, the government said. The delay is due to a tussle with European commissioners who were at first reluctant to grant state aid approval for the project, after complaints that the process of awarding contracts had not been competitive. Only two bidders  BT Group and Japanese firm Fujitsu  were chosen as approved contractors, and Fujitsu has yet to win a contract. Public funds are being matched by industry, local councils, and in some cases by the European Regional Development Fund. Areas expected to have completed procurement by December are Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Wiltshire, and Devon and Somerset. Lancashire, Rutland and Cumbria have signed contracts and are preparing for implementation. Wales, North Yorkshire and Surrey are through procurement and into delivery. The Treasury said the government was working to prioritise projects with particular delivery challenges, such as Northumberland, which will move to procurement on 10 December 2012. Since Brussels approved the framework contract being used by local councils, &quot;implementation of local broadband projects is developing at demonstrable pace&quot;, according to the infrastructure progress report published on Wednesday. As part of the drive to wire up the UK, Osborne confirmed plans to improve mobile phone coverage in rural areas, with a contract expected to be awarded in &quot;spring 2013&quot; and the first mast funded by the scheme to go live by the end of next year.",

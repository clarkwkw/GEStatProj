    "text": "Endless January resolutions and good intentions for a healthier new year do not go unnoticed by app developers, hence the glut of fitness aids that have hit the marketplace in the past few weeks. There are already a host of excellent tools available, from the trusty Nike+ GPS (1.49, Apple App Store) - which measures pace and route through an iPhone on the cold morning jogs, to the more exotic iTrailMap (free, App Store), providing detailed trail maps for skiing around the globe. The best of the latest, however, is from ThinQ Fitness (App Store). It&apos;s free to download, and gives access to a plethora of instructional workout videos, grouped for a variety of needs  from beginners to more experienced gym-bunnies. Full membership is from 4.99/month, giving total access to all the videos. Sadly, willpower and/or a scary personal trainer to force compliance aren&apos;t included in the package.",

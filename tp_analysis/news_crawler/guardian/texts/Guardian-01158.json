    "text": "While games developers that make big-budget titles often struggle with balancing creative daring and profitability, browser games remain a haven for originality. They mark the point on the medium&apos;s creative frontier where the accessible and the unusual intersect, the perfect place to expand the gaming experience beyond the norm. Soul Brother, for example, at first glance looks like a fairly conventional platform game. However, it soon unveils a consciousness-hopping mechanic where killing oneself  rather than the usual self-preservation encouraged in most games  allows a player to take possession of the soul of a different creature with abilities more suited to each new challenge. A great deal less morbid than it sounds, it&apos;s also filled with cheery personality and elegant design flourishes. Meanwhile, Traal, which like Soul Brother adopts the pixel-art aesthetic of games from the past, offers up a strange and sometimes unnerving survival horror game, taking gamers on a bleak journey through 2D dungeons. Made in just 48 hours, it is a beautifully simple piece of interactive design. And then there&apos;s the remarkably slick International Racing Squirrels, commissioned by Channel 4 Education to raise teenagers&apos; awareness of financial literacy. Essentially a sports management game themed around its titular tree-dwelling rodents, it deftly balances the serious message with a playful spirit and sharp wit, and is something with the potential to entertain way beyond its target audience.",

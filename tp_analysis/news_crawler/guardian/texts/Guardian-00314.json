    "text": "The study of psychology is facing a crisis. A lot of research  doesnt show the same results when the experiment is repeated, and it is critical we address this problem. But the Research Excellence Framework has led to a research culture which is suffocating attempts to stabilise psychology in particular, and science in general.  The Ref encourages universities to push for groundbreaking, novel, and exciting research in the form of 4* papers, but it does not reward the efforts of those who replicate studies. As universities gear up for the next Ref submission in 2021, many researchers will not even consider attempts to replicate results.  False information The point of replicating a study is to test whether a statistically significant result will appear again if the experiment is repeated. Of course, a similar result may not appear  casting into question the validity of the results from the first experiment.  Last year, the Open Science Collaboration attempted to replicate 100 studies from highly ranked psychological journals. While 97% of the original studies had a statistically significant result, just 36% of the replications had the same outcome.    Related: Scientists aren't superheroes  failure is a valid result    Equally worrying: when an effect did appear, it was often much smaller than previously thought.  Recent data calls into question some widely influential findings in psychological science. These problems are not confined to psychology however  many findings published in scientific literature may actually be false. Science is supposed to be self-correcting and reproducibility is a cornerstone of the scientific method. Yet, in the top 100 journals between 1900 and 2012, just 1.6% of studies were replications. We simply arent invested in replicating findings. We all want to be good researchers and understand more about how the world works. So why are we so reluctant to check our conclusions are valid? No incentive One problem is the sheer volume of work  new publications emerge in the millions each year. But a larger issue is the systems we carry out our research in: US universities have a tenure model, where job security is achieved through high numbers of publications. In Australia, prestigious research fellowships are similarly focused on a publish or perish mentality. Worryingly, many academics admit to engaging in at least one questionable research practice in order to achieve publication. Examples of this include: coming up with a hypotheses after data is collected, stopping collecting data when an effect appears in case it disappears later, or only reporting the significant effects from collected data. Others simply fabricate data  Dutch psychologist Diederik Stapel shockingly falsified data from more than 50 studies.  In the UK, the Ref ranks the published works of researchers according to their originality (how novel is the research?), significance (does it have practical or commercial importance?), and rigour (is the research technically sound?). Outputs are then awarded one to four stars.  While research publications with 1* rankings are only recognised nationally for their originality, significance, and rigour, 4* rankings are considered world-leading. The cumulative total of 3* and 4* papers determines research funding allocation and has a knock-on effect on institutional position in league tables and therefore attractiveness to students. Obviously, the more publications the better. Novelty bias On the face of it, the Ref works quite well because it rewards quality work  it is better to publish fewer articles containing highly original and significant work. Those who do criticise it argue that the assessment process is overly complex and expensive and that universities can, and do, game the system.  But we argue that these criticisms miss a bigger and more fundamental issue: the Ref completely undermines our efforts to produce a reliable body of knowledge.  Why? The focus on originality and accessibility  publications exploring new areas of research using new paradigms, and avoiding testing well-established theories  is the exact opposite of what science needs to be doing to solve the troubling replication crisis. According to Ref standards, replicating an already published piece of work is simply uninteresting.   Related: Five reasons why the REF is not fit for purpose    A BMJ study has shown that in science abstracts published between 1974 and 2015, the use of the words groundbreaking, innovative, and novel increased by 2500%. This reflects a cultural shift in language, encouraged by systems like the Ref, rather than a change in science itself.  With the next Ref just four years away, many researchers are effectively faced with a choice: be a good scientist, or be a successful academic who gets funding and a promotion.  Potential solutions Researchers in psychology  the discipline truly at the heart of the replication crisis  are leading the way for change. We now have the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science, initiatives encouraging a more open and collaborative science  and opportunities to improve training in research methods drawing upon the Open Science Framework. These programmes are gaining traction and becoming adopted across not only the UK, but the global research community. Encouragingly, a growing number of psychologists are pushing for change, calling for pre-registration of work to encourage transparency, and consortium-based undergraduate projects. If the Ref changed its criteria to reward such practices, it would do more for science than all of the 4* outputs combined.

    "text": "    Jupiter is an award winning fund management firm with one of the best-known brands in the UK investment industry. The company was formed in 1985 and now manages some 22.3bn* of funds on behalf of both private investors and institutions. While investments can fall as well as rise and past performance is not a guide to the future, Jupiter has a strong reputation for delivering outperformance across its range of investment capabilities over the medium to long term. The Company has a long history of green investing and manages several funds of this type. It has an active sustainable investment and governance team. At challenging economic times such as these it is significant that we are seeing a subtle, but important, shift towards longer-term thinking across a range of financial institutions. We believe this will continue to strengthen next year, and in years to come, but the pace must quicken if capital markets are going to be a primary facilitator of a truly sustainable economy. Given this difficult economic backdrop, shifting demographics, complex politics and heightened scarcity of resources, the concept of sustainability in a company&apos;s business model will require a greater focus on the governance of sustainability.",

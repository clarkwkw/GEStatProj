    "text": "Picture the scene: you&apos;re a British developer keen to take advantage of the government&apos;s forthcoming 25% tax relief for games production. But there&apos;s a problem: to qualify, you have to pass a test, a test that judges your project against a series of cultural criteria. Was it made in the UK? Does it feature the UK? Does it in anyway promote the UK? It&apos;s all very clear but, well, how do you effectively approach these questions if your game is an abstract puzzler written by one person who lives in Slough but perhaps emigrated to the country from Australia? Welcome to the world of EU-regulated aid.  On Tuesday, the government revealed its draft legislation for UK games industry tax credits, which it committed itself to in the 2012 budget and which it formalised in last week&apos;s autumn statement. From April 2013, British developers will be able to claim relief on up to 25% of the tax they pay, a system that should, as everyone keeps saying, &quot;level the playing field&quot;, in a global industry where some countries (we&apos;re looking at you Canada) offer up to a 37.5% tax relief on games production. Importantly, there is no minimum spend threshold, so smaller studios and startups can apply. It also covers development expenditure after the game is release, thereby recognising that most titles these days have some form of online multiplayer service and DLC plan. That&apos;s all good. But this is where the cultural test comes in. EU law prohibits the straightforward use of state aid to help domestic businesses because it would provide an unfair advantage in what is supposed to be a single common market. &quot;However, it is possible to have a tax credit for video games production if it supports culturally relevant products,&quot; says Dr Richard Wilson, the chief executive of Tiga, which represents independent developers in the UK. &quot;Under the government&apos;s plans, games will have to pass a cultural test in order to be classified as culturally British games and so benefit from games tax relief.&quot; This is exactly how tax relief works for the British movie industry, and how France is able to offer its games developers tax credits. It&apos;s all about culture. So what does the cultural test look like? At this draft stage, it takes the form of a Britishness checklist; to qualify for tax breaks, a developer must show that their project would earn at least 16 points on the list. Sixteen points are available for actual content; so for example, you get four points if 75% of the game is set in the UK or another EEA member state and up to four points depending on how many characters are from the UK or another EEA state. A further eight points are available in respect of personnel involved with the project. So you get one point each for, say, a programmer, producer, artist or musician who&apos;s a EEA citizen or UK resident. There are bonus points available if the game uses the English language and if it, &quot;promotes, develops or enhances British culture&quot;. The UK trade bodies have declared themselves satisfied with the draft  though some tweaking is going to be necessary. &quot;Broadly speaking the legislation looks like it&apos;s heading in the right direction,&quot; says Jo Twist of UKIE. &quot;Government seems to have listened to some of the key recommendations that we made, such as not having a minimum budget threshold for games to qualify for relief and allowing games businesses to claim for post-release development costs. We mustn&apos;t be complacent though and we&apos;ll be working through the legislation in great detail to make sure that all other aspects of the scheme are fully considered&quot;. What some developers are asking, is how some of the parameters of the test are going to be applied to products which take place in wholly imagined virtual environments. &quot;The vast majority of games are not set in real places, and even when they are it&apos;s not as easy as taking a camera to a location,&quot; says Matthew Hanlon of Bitbybit Games. &quot;It&apos;s as easy to create the Mushroom Kingdom or the surface of a colonised Mars as it would be to build parts of the UK. Additionally, how are we judging this? Does an historical UK count, or a fictional one? If I build a Victorian steam punk game in a dark, foggy city and call it London does it count?&quot; One major gripe seems to be that the test is weighted in favour of content (a possible 16 points) rather than staff (a possible eight points), which some feel will discriminate against developers working on more abstract concepts. &quot;Take our title Land-a Panda as an example,&quot; says Paul Virapen of Big Pixel Games. &quot;It&apos;s a puzzle game set in a make-believe world with floating platforms, and two lovestruck pandas. These pandas are named after the two in Edinburgh Zoo  Yang Guang and Tian Tian  does that make them UK characters? Or are they Chinese characters on loan to the UK?  &quot;The story isn&apos;t exactly British  it&apos;s about the male panda trying to meet up with the female panda to save the world&apos;s panda population. And there is no dialogue. So if we were making this game again and applying for tax breaks, the chances are we&apos;d get zero points for the content, but our entire team is based in the UK, so we might get eight points for that, which is nowhere near qualifying&quot;. It&apos;s an ironic prospect  tax credits were meant to release UK developers from certain financial restraints, allowing them to take more creative risks. So what happens if projects start to be modified to meet the cultural test criteria, not just in terms of setting, but in terms of genre? &quot;The cultural test seems biased towards traditional third- and first-person games with characters and realistic locations,&quot; agrees Anna Marsh, design director at Lady Shotgun. &quot;Abstract puzzle games with no characters and non-realworld locations (like we&apos;re planning for our next game!) are going to have a hard time making up the points they&apos;d be ineligble for. And this may, rather ironically, make for less &quot;cultural&quot; games, and more that conform to the well-trodden third/first-person path&quot;. Other developers haven&apos;t been as worried, convinced the system can be played to garner the requisite number of points. &quot;Many people have been talking about the cultural test like it&apos;ll mean they have to put union flags throughout, and create massive story-driven games with characters popping up to say &apos;what ho!&apos; every now and again,&quot; says James Parker of Opposable Games. &quot;But a number of years ago, I worked on the American Idol game, a karaoke game made exclusively for the American market, based on American franchise, and sold only in America ... and even that passes the cultural Britishness test!&quot; &quot;With that in mind, I&apos;m sure that most British developers are not going to struggle with the rules as they stand. And if we do struggle, then we&apos;ll stick our best QA people on it  they&apos;ll always find a way to bend, break, or exploit a badly designed system!&quot; Byron Atkinson-Jones, founder of Xiotex Studios, was involved in the consultation process that led to the draft legislation. He reckons developers need to understand that this is the beginning of an ongoing process. &quot;[The government advisers] were keen to point out that this is by no means the end of the story; as with all legislation the first round is hardly going to be a sweeping success and that it&apos;s something that they plan to evolve and improve upon when it&apos;s actually put into action.  &quot;That means it&apos;s up to us as developers to make sure that we shape the future of the tax break by giving feedback and actually attempting to apply for tax relief. The fact that we got a tax break at all is an amazing step forward, but we would be naive to assume that meant the baby steps stopped as soon as they announced it. This is going to take work from both sides before we get something we are all happy with&quot;. Indeed, the legislation process will now enter into another period of consultation until 6 February giving interested parties time to respond to the draft and seek clarifications. Jo Twist wants developers to take an active role: &quot;It is absolutely vital that we all take the time to pore over the detail of the legislation to make sure that the system that we have in place in 2013 offers maximum benefits to all games companies, from small start-ups, to established publisher-owned studios. And we mustn&apos;t forget that we will need to get EC clearance too&quot;. Beyond all this is an argument that it isn&apos;t about merely filling in inconvenient forms; that the cultural test really ought to stand for something. &quot;I suddenly hit the fairly stark and obvious realisation that this is other peoples&apos; tax money we&apos;re talking about, here,&quot; says Dan Marshall of Size Five Games. &quot;This is money that could otherwise be used for over-worked nurses, or underpaid teachers.  &quot;Spending it on videogames seems a little frivolous unless of course it&apos;s art for the cultural betterment of the country. It&apos;s an impossible line to straddle, and I think I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that in order to justify taking that tax money away from other arguably more-vital services there needs to be some sort of quantifiable knock-on benefit. To that end, I think the points system, and list of criteria is actually fairly vital&quot;. UKIE is running a series of workshops to help developers to understand and take advantage of tax relief.

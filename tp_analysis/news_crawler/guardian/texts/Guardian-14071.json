    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Fresh from playful pastiches of Batman, The Lord Of The Rings and other cinematic greats, Lego&apos;s now setting its sights on games. Lego City Undercover is Grand Theft Auto junior, where you&apos;re Chase McCain, accident-prone super cop in pursuit of the misbehaving Rex Fury. That gives you licence to borrow (note: not hijack) any vehicle and wreak mayhem in the name of the law, smashing everything you see into its component studs. Although it takes its cues from GTA, the trademark slapstick and cornucopia of film references give LCU a more lighthearted sense of humour, spreading its appeal to all ages. Actually playing it, though, you&apos;ll discover a game that&apos;s firmly aimed at kids, who&apos;ll appreciate its gentle pace and fairly simple interactions (which can be hampered by slow load times); adults meanwhile may well find themselves hankering after the games that inspired it.",

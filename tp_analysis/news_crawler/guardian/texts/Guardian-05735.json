    "text": "Every British city has something to offer the curious birder. You&apos;ll find snipes, pied wagtails and meadow pipits on the brownfield sites of Leicester, for example. In York, there are little ringed plovers living in gravel pits on urban wasteland. In Old Trafford, Manchester, I&apos;ve seen sparrowhawks and cormorants fly over while I&apos;ve been watching the match. Show me a city, and I can show you a bird  that&apos;s my philosophy. My enthusiasm for city birding goes back to my childhood. When I was a young kid, birdwatchers came in one guise: tweed-wearing, walking-stick wielding, white, middle-class, middle-aged country-dwelling men. As a black kid from London, I was a true anomaly. I was born with an innate curiosity about birds. They held a special fascination for me from an early age. I remember trying to lure birds by sticking scraps of newspaper to my clothes and squatting by the back door surrounded by pieces of bread  Needless to say, my early attempts at attracting birds failed, so I resorted to exploring my immediate surroundings, studying every bird book I could get my hands on. Over time, I became a fully-fledged &quot;urban birder&quot;. Even today, birders remain sceptical of the term, shunning the city in favour of deserted coastal headlands, but I&apos;ve had some incredible experiences of birding in cities. Nowadays, my local patch is Wormwood Scrubs in west London. During the migratory season in April and May, I&apos;m out there every morning from sunrise. I&apos;ve seen ospreys flapping overhead and heard quails singing in the grass. And I consider myself blessed because, for eight years, my all-time favourite bird, the ring ouzel (a blackbird-sized thrush with a white crescent on its chest), has stopped off here on its migratory path. Predominantly found in remote mountainous areas in the north and west of Britain, these birds are really hard to spot. Even in their natural habitat you can&apos;t get within 100 yards of them, so I feel incredibly lucky to have them visit my patch. The most emotional experience I&apos;ve had birding occurred in April 2010, when I noticed a pair of skylarks had decided to settle on Wormwood Scrubs. They are such rural birds I felt duty bound to protect their space, so I worked out where they were nesting and warded off the dogs-walkers in a desperate attempt to encourage their stay. But sadly, the clamour of the city proved too much. I was there the morning they took off east, never to return. That was probably my saddest day in birding. That said, there are birds that thrive in urban settings. The black redstart, for example, is the archetypal urban bird. They first bred in the capital in 1922 and, during the second world war, nested in bomb sites. There are only 25-73 pairs of these birds left breeding in the UK and yet, occasionally, in bustling Soho, you can look up and find a male singing on top of an aerial. How amazing is that? While not every species can survive the city, urban areas provide nesting, resting and feeding sites in a multitude of habitats. This is partly because urban centres generate a &quot;heat island&quot; (the temperature can be three degrees warmer in the day and 10 degrees higher at night than the countryside), but also because we city-dwellers love to feed our garden birds. Nowadays, I offer urban birder masterclasses. These guided tours can be on your doorstep: in local cemeteries, on heathland, even in the concrete-clad city centre. I&apos;m not trying to turn everyone into a birder, just to give city-dwellers more of an awareness of the spectacular sights that surround them. Urban birding for beginners The following will help fledging birders, but remember you don&apos;t have to identify everything: just enjoy birds for the beautiful creatures they are.

Surprise visitors might include a marauding sparrowhawk, a squawking parakeet or a handsome great spotted woodpecker. Buy a book and binocularsKeep a bird book by your kitchen window (the RSPB Handbook of British Birds is ideal for beginners). Soon you will be able to identify everything that ventures into your garden. And ask for a pair of binoculars for your birthday. They will open up a whole new world of delight. Look upEven in the very centre of Britain&apos;s cities, birds are flying overhead. You only have to look up to notice gulls, wood pigeons and peregrines soaring through the skyline. Find fellow birders Hang out with and learn from more experienced birders by joining your local bird club or RSPB group. Mark your territoryFind an area close to your home and start watching it on a regular basis. Get to know the resident birds and, over a year, you will notice changes in the populations as the different seasonal visitors make their appearance.  David Lindo is a writer and broadcaster.

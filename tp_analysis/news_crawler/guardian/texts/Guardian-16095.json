The study has shown that people can intentionally suppress incriminating memories and thereby avoid detection in brain activity guilt detection tests. Such tests, which are commercially available in the United States and are used by law enforcement agencies in several countries, including Japan and India, are based on the logic that criminals will have specific memories of their crime stored in their brain. When presented with reminders of their crime, it was previously assumed that their brain would automatically and uncontrollably recognise these details. However, research has shown that some people can intentionally and voluntarily suppress unwanted memories. Dr Zara Bergstrom, lecturer at the University of Kent , says: &quot;Brain activity guilt detection tests are promoted as accurate and reliable measures for establishing criminal culpability. Our research has shown that this assumption is not always justified. Using these types of tests to say that someone is innocent of a crime is not valid because it could just be the case that the suspect has managed to hide their crime memories.&quot;  Newcastle University Business SchoolResearch shows that the fear of being called upon to speak in class, combined with an inability to ask questions, means that people who stammer (PWS) are often unable to fully engage with their learning. Dr Clare Butler, a lecturer at the Business School, says: &quot;First, participants reported that the emotional strain of spending each day at school feeling anxious because of their speech, and specifically the possibility of being asked to speak or read aloud in class, meant that they were keen to leave the educational environment as soon as possible. Second, but arguably related to the first, participants stated that they were often lacking the qualifications to gain a place at university. This has clear implications for the social and economic prospects of PWS.&quot; She adds: &quot;Many of the people I spoke to described both frustration and hopelessness at the end of their time at school.&quot; Arts and humanities     Photograph: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images     University of Southampton / Natural History Museum ViennaClothing and jewellery displayed on a catwalk will demonstrate findings of a three-year collaborative research project by archaeologists at the University of Southampton and the Natural History Museum Vienna. The project explores how prehistoric people dressed and expressed creativity and identity through pottery, metalwork and textiles during the period 1800-500 BC. University of Southampton archaeologist Dr Jo Sofaer, says: &quot;It is well understood that the Bronze Age saw huge advances in techniques to produce clothes, pottery and metal objects, but the wealth of creativity employed when making these goods is little recognised or researched. Dr Karina Grmer from Natural History Museum Vienna, says: &quot;usually a picture of dull and unattractive clothing comes into our mind if we think about people from prehistory. We would like to show that the people from Stone and Bronze Ages made the best out of their materials. They used patterns, colour and nice jewellery, and they had their style, their wish to express wealth, status, identity and personality. All the costumes are based on archaeological finds and they were handmade by us.&quot; Social science     Photograph: Damien Meyer/AFP     University of Manchester Government pressure on schools to abandon programmes which promote wellbeing will have &apos;disastrous&apos; effects on vulnerable pupils, according to University of Manchester research. Neil Humphrey, a professor of psychology of education, says the evidence shows social and emotional learning (SEL) in primary schools can have powerful effects on attainment, discipline and mental health. He said: &quot;If social and emotional learning is properly implemented, especially at primary school level, then the effects can be profound because children are in a better position to learn. Most evidence suggests that teaching social and emotional skills in childhood can prevent problems further down the line, particularly for pupils whose family and community backgrounds may place them at-risk.&quot; Humphrey added: &quot;But because of the Coalition&apos;s obsession with academic scores and testing, we&apos;ve now gone backwards. It&apos;s a disaster for those vulnerable pupils politicians claim they aim to support. Many schools still continue with SEL  but because there&apos;s apparently no appetite for this at Government level, many will see it as a risk and are likely to abandon or ignore it.&quot;  University of HuddersfieldSex offenders who spend time in probation service hostels after being freed from jail are forming social groups which encourage them to believe that there was nothing seriously wrong with the behaviour that led to their conviction, according to a researcher at the University of Huddersfield. Over the course of two years, Dr Carla Reeves observed the formation of social groups at a hostel where high-risk offenders spend several months on licence after being released from prison. Some 75% of the inmates had committed sexual offences, against either adults or children. Reeves says: &quot;This is a place where the offenders can be tested out in the community to make sure that they are safe. Any offence-based community programmes that need to be done with them are carried out at this stage.&quot; Reeves adds: &quot;It was a negative process. They developed a supportive attitude, telling each other that what they had done wasn&apos;t really wrong or wasn&apos;t that bad, that at least they weren&apos;t taking drugs and being violent. So they were encouraging each other to continue behaving and thinking as they had done prior to prison.&quot; In her research, she calls for new strategies and training to ensure that sex offenders do not rejoin society without challenging their behaviour, making them less likely to reoffend. And finally     Photograph: Christopher Thomas/Getty Images     Nottingham Trent UniversitySquashed under a hay bale, starvation and even electrocution are just some of the ways in which hedgehogs can meet their fate in the countryside, finds study. Research has shed new light on the activities of hedgehogs and the various threats they face. Experts have found that the most common cause of death for hedgehogs was traffic, while some were killed and eaten by badgers after being scooped out of their spiky hides. One hedgehog was easy prey after having its spikes removed by a garden strimmer. The researchers also found evidence of hedgehogs eating toads to supplement their typical diet of worms, beetles, snails and spiders. Dr Richard Yarnell, lead researcher and expert in biodiversity conservation at Nottingham Trent University, says: &quot;The study is producing some really interesting results, things that we weren&apos;t previously aware of. It&apos;s apparent that hedgehogs face many dangers in the UK countryside, not just traffic and predation as we might have previously thought. As we start to establish a better picture of their movements and activities it will help us to identify potential conservation methods for the future.&quot; Would you like your university&apos;s research featured on the network?

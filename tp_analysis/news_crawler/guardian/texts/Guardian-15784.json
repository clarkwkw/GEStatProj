    "text": "At a time of the year when many students around the UK are beginning to drift off for the summer, 1,000 first years at the University of Exeter have signed up for a study series centred on big world problems like climate change, ageing, ethical banking, child health and international security. At the centre of this work is a revolutionary idea with a terrible name: interdisciplinarity. What this means is that students from, say, English are learning from biologists, physicists and mathematicians as well as the humanities. How does this add to the learning experience? We see two main benefits: it teaches students to see things from different perspectives and demonstrates that most problems require a solution that draws on different skills. Take climate change. It&apos;s all very well coming up with new technologies and new strategies, but if people don&apos;t adopt them they&apos;re not worth a fig. Workable solutions depend on an understanding of technologies, climate systems and human behaviour (at least) to make a real difference. This is certainly the way that research is heading in UK higher education and this is now being applied to learning too. Exeter&apos;s programme, entitled Grand Challenges, is designed to expose students to a wide range of academic input from outside their usual subject areas. We have brought in a range of external speakers in addition to our own researchers, and the programme mixes cultural, social and sporting elements including a festival on campus during the middle weekend. There is a strong employability theme running through all these activities. Students can no longer rely on their degree to guarantee them a job, or even an interview. Employers are looking for graduates who can take their academic training and apply it in a real world situation, and Grand Challenges is designed to give students the opportunity to do just that by developing skills like communication, commercial awareness, customer focus and data handling. There is also a session on presenting yourself online and in person to potential employers, some of whom are offering work placements to participants. More than 50 of our students will get the opportunity to go to the two-day Battle of Ideas public debate in London this October and three of the very best will win a trip to Johannesburg to represent their university at the One Young World summit, where they will join speakers and students from all over the world to debate global dilemmas. The programme also helps the university to address the thorny question of value for money. A recent Which? report claimed that a third of undergraduates thought their course was poor value based on the number of teaching contact hours they received. Clearly for many students (and parents, too) the amount of time spent in lectures, tutorials and seminars is becoming a proxy for value for money. For universities, the rise in fee income only just about replaces the lost teaching grant. But we would be unwise to make much of this argument. Consumers of higher education are paying more and want to see more for their money. We are doing all the usual things to demonstrate value for money at Exeter. We have introduced minimum contact hours for teaching time and set out turn-around times for marking and returning work. We have also invested 480m in facilities, much of it student facing like our new student services centre, the Forum. Standard of facilities does count in the value for money argument, but so does the wider learning experience. Schemes like this add a new dimension to learning and go some way to answering the value for money question. Our aim is to help students develop a more rounded education, apply what they are learning to some real world issues and become more employable when they graduate. Of course, it&apos;s also a chance to apply research more widely and open up student minds to the latest findings from beyond their immediate area of study. In this way, we aim to be innovators in education as well as research.

    "text": "What youll learnMedicine is one of those degrees that require five years at university (four if youre on a graduate course). Once qualified, you will work with patients, but many further years of training are likely as you become specialised in a particular branch of medicine. Throughout this time you will study the many facets of the human body, be able to diagnose and treat disease, and know what is needed to maintain health. Courses vary. Some are divided into pre-clinical and clinical parts; others are more integrated. Some adopt a systems-based approach (the cardiovascular system, the nervous system etc); others a problem-based approach. You need to decide which style of learning will suit you best. In general, the early part of the course will develop your basic skills and knowledge to get you ready for your hospital experience. You will be studying the function of the human body, and the psychology and sociology of ill health and illness. There will be teaching associated with general medicine and surgery, while subsequent years will cover the major clinical specialities (for example: renal medicine, oncology, neurology).  By the time you graduate you should be fit to begin on-the-job training. Although you will just be starting out on your career and wont be expected to know it all, you should be able to assess a patient, diagnose any problems and manage treatment. You will understand how disease affects the patient and be able to advise on healthy living. You should have developed a certain level of compassion for your patients. Delivering bad news to a patient or their family will never be easy, but a caring attitude and an interest in the patients needs is an important part of being a doctor. You will also gain an understanding of the legal and ethical issues that come with a career in medicine. You should have developed a way of coping with working long hours and not getting much sleep.   interactive   How youll learnYou will learn through lectures, seminars, tutorials, lab work and bedside demonstrations. All of this study will be backed up with hospital placements.  What are the entry requirements?If you do chemistry, biology and one from maths or physics you will keep all the medical schools open to you. If you do chemistry and biology you will keep open the vast majority. If you do chemistry and one from maths and physics you will limit your range of choices much more.    interactive   What job you could doAfter graduation you will begin a two-year training programme in a hospital. In a sense you will never really finish training. Medicine is a constantly evolving area, so you will need to keep up with new advancements. After these initial two years you will train to specialise in a specific field, perhaps surgery, or in general practice. The length of training will depend upon what you choose. You can always veer more into the research side of medicine or lecturing.",

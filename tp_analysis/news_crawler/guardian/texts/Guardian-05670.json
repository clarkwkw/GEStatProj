    "text": "While it&apos;s encouraging that David Cameron has restated his pledge to lead the greenest government ever, his assertion that it&apos;s already been achieved is jaw-droppingly wide of the mark (I&apos;ve delivered on promise to be greenest government ever, says PM, 27 April). Earlier this year the government fired the starting pistol for a new &quot;dash for gas&quot; by allowing new gas-fired stations to be built without any restriction on the amount of carbon they emit until the middle of the century  which would leave the UK hooked on expensive fossil fuels for decades. The electricity market reform bill, expected in the Queen&apos;s speech, is an ideal opportunity for the PM to show his government&apos;s commitment to a cleaner future. The aim should be an electricity system almost entirely free from carbon by 2030  and a huge investment in the nation&apos;s substantial clean energy potential. Such an approach would be popular with the public too. A new survey published this week to launch our new energy campaign, Clean British Energy, showed more than 85 per cent wanted the government to develop renewable energy from UK wind, solar and wave power and reduce the use of gas. If Mr Cameron wants to show green leadership and fix our broken energy system he must show his true colours.Andy AtkinsExecutive director, Friends of the Earth",

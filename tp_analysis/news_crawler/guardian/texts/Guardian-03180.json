    "text": "Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has spent the past couple of years articulating a message of support for civil society as a vital part of the development process, with a special focus on women&apos;s rights, to complement America&apos;s traditional concentration on the role of the private sector. Her focus on &quot;people-to-people&quot; diplomacy has been described as &quot;post-modern&quot; by the China Daily, and may be one of her lasting legacies. South America is the latest continent to hear this message. At the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena on Saturday, Clinton told civil society representatives they are needed &quot;more than ever&quot; to respond to the region&apos;s social and ethnic inequalities. She is right. As more and more Latin countries take off economically (HSBC bank predicts Peru will be the 26th largest economy in the world by 2050), lack of money is by no means the main problem for most, if it ever was. The problem is the terrible distribution of wealth. As in any country, the role of civil society and trade unions will be central to the battle for greater fairness. It is, in one sense, an odd message to be emanating from the US. Latin Americans will take a long time to forget the way perceived threats to US economic interests have been brutally put down in the past, with not the slightest concern for the welfare of civil society movements. But the US focus on democracy and civil rights is real, however hypocritical. Global civil society may find America to be one of its greatest allies in future years, especially as other major powers like China and Russia don&apos;t even give a rhetorical nod towards such freedoms. A big problem for attempts by civil society in Latin America to play a strong part in the future of regional politics is funding. A new Civicus report says civil society groups in developing countries depend on international aid for 80% of their budgets, based on survey evidence. This dependence may not be ideal, and it can lead to a range of contradictions and complications, but  in the face of entrenched elites who have historically managed their countries&apos; resources for the benefit of the few rather than the many  it is nevertheless the reality. With little tradition of public citizen funding of NGOs, non-international funds would need to come from the private sector, government, or high net worth individuals. Civil society will increasingly need to explore these options, but none bodes well for a strong and independent civil society. The gradual retreat of international aid from Latin America will do nothing to help support this vital third sector of the development system. The EU has just announced it will end bilateral aid to 11 Latin American countries by 2014. The UK has already done so, and Spain, one of the region&apos;s major development partners, has savaged its aid budget due to economic implosion at home  in 2011, it was 33% lower than in 2010. In a context of diminishing quantities, it is all the more important that remaining aid is directed where it is really needed. Unfortunately, regional aid policies are strongly influenced by a well-known  but in this case misguided  philosophy of aid effectiveness known as the Paris agenda. The main thrust of this agenda is that more and more money should support government development strategies and be aligned to government systems. In many countries (predominantly high-aid countries, according to our latest categorisation) this is a sensible stricture, after years of aid that has undermined state development. But Latin America is a low-aid continent: almost all its countries are very low-aid countries (that is, they receive less  usually far less  than 1% of their gross national income in aid). End aid tomorrow and, after a little budget shifting, most Latin American governments would hardly flinch. Civil society, however, would be decimated. The problems have already started, with vital civil society movements from the Tijuana to Tierra del Fuego struggling to raise money to fund their advocacy and accompaniment work. Without them, vulnerable communities, both urban and rural, will be less likely to achieve their fair share of the overall economic pot, or resist threats to their wellbeing. Instead of following the Paris prescription, aid money should be used to support non-government initiatives. Governments have the money they need (and if they don&apos;t, they should raise taxes on the wealthy); it is the critics of government, those with alternative visions or representing different interests, who need to be protected and promoted. Money is not everything, and reduced international funding may well also have some positive benefits such as stronger domestic leadership and fewer donor fads. But it is essential for effective campaigning and agenda-leadership. Without urgent reassessment, the Paris agenda is in danger of doing serious harm in Latin America and other low-aid countries.",

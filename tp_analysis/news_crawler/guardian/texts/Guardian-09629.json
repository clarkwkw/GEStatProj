    "text": "The education secretary, Michael Gove, has raised the bar for prospective teachers by unveiling an overhaul of tests in a move he claimed would improve the status of the profession. Gove said the new &quot;rigorous selection&quot; for trainees would help raise standards in the classroom. The move came as the education minister David Laws accused teachers of having &quot;depressingly low expectations&quot; for their pupils. Labour accused ministers of sending mixed signals in their education reforms, pointing out that plans to overhaul tests for trainee teachers came just three months after the government relaxed the requirement for teachers employed by free schools and academies to have a formal teaching qualification. Under the newest proposals, to be introduced from next September, anyone who wants to train as a teacher will have to complete revamped tests in English and maths. A paper on verbal, numerical and abstract reasoning is also due to be introduced in the next few years. Calculators will not be allowed and the pass marks for both the English and maths tests will be raised again, the Department for Education (DfE) said. The plans have been recommended by a review group of headteachers and education experts, which was set up in March. The government said at the time it wanted to toughen up the tests taken by trainee teachers because of concerns that many took several attempts to pass. The current tests, in literacy and numeracy, are taken towards the end of teacher training, with the latest figures showing that 98% of people pass. From this autumn, trainees have been limited to two re-sits for each paper and the pass mark has been raised for the first time. It is to be raised again over the next three years, with candidates eventually needing to score the equivalent of a grade B at GCSE to pass, the DfE said. The maths test is likely to include questions on topics such as algebra and graphs, while the English paper will ask candidates to answer open-ended questions, with marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar. Gove said: &quot;The evidence from around the world is clear  rigorous selection of trainee teachers is key to raising the quality and standing of the teaching profession. These changes will mean that parents can be confident that we have the best teachers coming into our classrooms. Above all, it will help ensure we raise standards in our schools and close the attainment gap between the rich and poor.&quot; Sally Coates, chair of the Skills Test Review Panel and the principal at Burlington Danes academy in west London, said the panel wanted to send &quot;a strong signal about the quality of teachers we all want to see&quot;. She said: &quot;We believe that the whole selection process needs to be sufficiently rigorous to ensure that anyone who gains a place on a course of initial teacher training would be highly likely to succeed in that training, and go on to make an excellent teacher.&quot; But Kevin Brennan, the shadow schools minister, said the government was sending mixed signals which was damaging the profession&apos;s morale. &quot;More and more schools are gaining academy status and as a result of that more and more schools are able to recruit people who are not qualified,&quot; he told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. &quot;Now how can you on the one hand say that people need to ensure that people who are coming in have better literacy and numeracy and on the other say that schools can employ unqualified individuals as teachers? &quot;That&apos;s a mixed message and it&apos;s having an impact on morale: we know there are 10,000 teachers who have left the profession, we know there are issues in recruitment, so the government has to get its message straight  we want properly qualified able individuals as teachers.&quot; Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said that the previous tests were not necessarily too easy and the new ones might not test the right skills. She also echoed the view that the government was sending out inconsistent messages through its reforms. &quot;All teachers need strong literacy skills and also a good grasp of mathematics,&quot; she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. &quot;It is however surprising that Michael Gove is showing such interest in the entry requirements for teacher training courses, while at the same time advocating that schools should be free to employ unqualified teachers. &quot;The real issue is the training and support that teachers are given once they have entered into teaching training. All too often the government is looking at ever shorter routes to qualifying as a teacher, including on-the-job training in schools. This leaves little opportunity or time for trainee teachers to be able to learn about child development and pedagogy in depth.&quot; Plans to improve the standing of teachers were announced as Laws, the Liberal Democrat education minister, blamed the profession for pupils&apos; lack of ambition. He claimed too many children were led to believe that top exam grades, places at elite universities and high-flying careers were beyond them. Laws told the Daily Telegraph: &quot;Teachers, colleges, careers advisers have a role and a responsibility to aim for the stars and to encourage people to believe they can reach the top in education and employment. That&apos;s not happening as much as it should do at the moment.&quot;",

    "text": "A fascinating Country Diary from King&apos;s Cross (27 March). Paul Evans&apos;s reference to the &quot;river Fleet buried below&quot; the station raises an interesting point. The new ticket hall takes its semi-circular shape from the curve of the Great Northern hotel, a protected building, which it abuts. Built in the 1850s, the hotel&apos;s shape was itself determined by a bend in the by now culverted river Fleet. The river may be invisible, but it continues to exert its influence. By the way, if the writer really wanted to pay homage to the river (and listen to its response), he should have done so before the Guardian moved offices: it can be heard rising from the iron grating outside the Coach and Horses pub, just off Farringdon Road.Roger HughesLondon  The river that runs through Trowbridge, Wiltshire&apos;s county town, the Biss, has to be carefully pronounced.Maureen WoodBradford on Avon, Wiltshire",

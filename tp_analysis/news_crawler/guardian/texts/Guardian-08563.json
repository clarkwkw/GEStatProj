    "text": "Given that Tekken Tag Tournament isone of the all-time great fighting titles and is still played today, it is a little surprising that it has taken Namco Bandai 12 years to create a sequel. But it has been worth the wait.Hardcore fans will find plenty to enjoy here, with more than 50 fighters, a plethora of modes, stunning visuals and new tag mechanics, including satisfying double-team moves. There&apos;s plenty for newcomers, too, including an impressive training section called Fight Lab. This story-driven, challenge-based mode is designed to turn amateurs into veterans, and while it can be tricky and frustrating at times, players who make it through will feel capable of taking on the best in the game&apos;s robust online modes. By no means a reinvention of the beat-&apos;em-up, TTT2 does stand toe-to-toewith the best, which with any luck means it won&apos;t be another 12 years before Namco releases a thirdinstalment.",

Nikon D5000, Nikkor 300mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR 1/10s f/7.1 at 300.0mm iso800    Question: This colourful southeast Asian mystery bird is notable for several characters: one is a behaviour that gave this bird and all its family members their common name and the other is a physical characteristic that sets this bird apart from all its family members. Can you tell me about either of these two characters? Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult blue-bearded bee-eater, Nyctyornis athertoni. This Asian bird is placed into the near passerine family, Meropidae, the bee-eaters. Although bee-eaters actually eat a variety of insects, they got their common family name because they specialise on hunting bees, wasps and hornets, which they snatch in flight.  Mystery birder greentamarind wrote:  As to the behaviors, the group are known for their unusual diet, requiring aggressive detoxification. This one is reported to sit in wait for prey to mistake it for a flower, rather than wasting energy in hot pursuit. [link].  Bee-eaters are colourful medium-sized insectivores with long tails, pointed wings and a characteristically-shaped downturned bill. They are not gregarious birds, and outside of breeding season -- when they feed broods of screaming fledglings -- are seen either alone or in pairs. They are sit-and-wait predators that remain motionless for long periods of time on a favoured perch before suddenly launching themselves into the air to capture their prey. Bee-eaters are cavity-nesters that dig a burrow into a sandy bank, similar to the kingfishers, which they are distantly related to.  The blue-bearded bee-eater is one of two species in its genus, both of which live in southern Asia. This genus is basal (which means it evolved along its own separate trajectory early in the history of this lineage) and is the sister taxon to the rest of the Meropidae.  The Nyctyornis bee-eaters are large -- in fact, the blue-bearded bee-eater is the largest meropid in the world. This species possesses a number of other physical characters that were mentioned by some of the mystery birders on the original mystery bird page, which I am taking the liberty of quoting here. Mystery birder icancho wrote:   They are named for their dietary predilections, and their bills are well built to help in delivering a strong bite at the bill-tip. [link]  and:  other differences of this genus from the others in the family are the square-ended tail and rather rounded wings. The rounder wing  and maybe the square tail too? likely relates to the fact that, unlike most other members of the family, they live in rather dense forest habitats and don&apos;t engage in the fast aerial pursuits typical of that family majority that live in open environments. Instead, the do the sit-and-wait plus sally thing that GT mentions. [link]  Nyctyornis&apos;s more rounded wing structure also gives this taxon a distinctive, heavier flapping flight, that sets them apart from the other bee-eaters. (I&apos;d guess that, if you are familiar with bee-eaters, you could potentially identify this genus simply by listening carefully to the sound of its wing flapping.)

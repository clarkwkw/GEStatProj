The research shows why, at a molecular level, plants are unable to flower during the juvenile phase of plant development. Ianis Matsoukas, a molecular physiologist and biology lecturer at the University of Bolton, says: &quot;Being able to understand and ultimately control juvenility will enable more predictable flowering, better scheduling and reduced wastage of crops. Knowing the mechanism gives us the tools to increase crop yield by accelerating or delaying time to flowering. This might also lead to higher yields of plants grown for biofuels and pulp production.&quot;  Research shows girls with learning and physical disabilities are more likely to suffer period problems compared to the general population. Menstrual problems in girls with disabilities are often unique to the population and can cause significant disruption to their lives, the review states. The Obstetrician &amp; Gynaecologist&apos;s editor-in-chief, Jason Waugh, says: &quot;Research on managing the menstrual problems of adolescents with disabilities is limited. Consequently there is a lack of evidence of best practice to guide healthcare professionals in this area. This review emphasises the need for further guidance for practitioners, as well as highlighting that care needs to be individualised.&quot; Arts and humanities     Photograph: AFP/Getty Images     The 40year friendship of Charles Darwin and Joseph Hooker, the most significant and scientifically important of Darwin&apos;s life, can now be explored by anyone in the world with access to the Internet. Their decades of correspondence include Darwin&apos;s most famous letter, where he first reveals that he has worked out a new theory for how species change. The 1,200 letters between Darwin and Hooker, 300 of which have not been published before, are being made available in more than 5,000 images by Cambridge&apos;s Digital Library. Alison Pearn of the Darwin Correspondence Project says: &quot;No single set of letters was more important to Darwin, or is more important now, than those exchanged with Hooker over 40 years  a period that encompasses almost the entirety of Darwin&apos;s mature working life. It is unusual for a single repository to hold both sides of any correspondence, so this is a rare opportunity to see one of the longest running and most wide-ranging conversations of the nineteenth-century unfold.&quot;  The private letters of composer Charles Wesley, who wrote some of the world&apos;s most popular hymns have been published, providing a rare glimpse into the birth of Methodism. The Oxford University Press edition is the first of two volumes containing all 700 surviving letters of the preacher. Wesley&apos;s &quot;Hark the Herald&quot; has been recorded by artists as diverse as Frank Sinatra and The Fall and has featured in TV programmes like &quot;South Park&quot; and the classic movie &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. Gareth Lloyd of the University of Manchester&apos;s John Rylands Library, who took ten years to complete volume 1 of the project with his co-editor, says: &quot;The publication of this collection will shine a light on a remarkable man living in one of the most significant periods in British history. Charles Wesley was more than just a hymn writer. As co-founder of the Methodist movement, he established a family of Churches with an estimated 75 million members and one which is still growing in many countries.&quot; Social science     Photograph: Lee Jae-Won/Reuters     Too much social media activity may damage strong relationships, according to a study by the Oxford Internet Institute. Researchers tested the theory of &apos;media multiplexity&apos; (the ability to communicate via several communications channels), which suggests that there is a clear link between the number of media channels used to communicate, the frequency with which they are used and the strength of relationship ties. Over 24,000 people in marital relationships took part in the new research, using 10 media channels. Bernie Hogan, who led the study, says: &quot;We found that those using more media tend to report no greater relationship satisfaction and some even reported decreasing satisfaction. This work suggests that media, which now includes online social media, still operates as a signal of ties of strength in relationships. However there may be a cut-off point after which the increasing complexity of maintaining so many separate communications threads starts to undermine relationship ties.&quot;  The cost implications of the UK government&apos;s recent plans to reform the funding system for care and support in England are analysed in a research paper by LSE and University of East Anglia, which considers the effects of options to give more help to lower income care home residents. Raphael Wittenberg, principal research fellow at LSE&apos;s personal social services research unit, says: &quot;The government&apos;s reforms will, we estimate, directly help over 100,000 care home residents at any time. They will tend to provide greater benefit to relatively better off older people, primarily because they currently have to pay the most for their care. Our research highlights two possible ways to modify the reforms, if resources permitted, in order to provide more help for those on relatively low to modest means.&quot; The research shows that lower income care home residents would gain since they are more likely than those with higher incomes to have assets in the range affected by these options. And finally     Photograph: Alamy     The rediscovery of a mystery animal in a museum&apos;s underground storeroom proves that a non-native &apos;big cat&apos; prowled the British countryside at the turn of the last century. The animal&apos;s skeleton and mounted skin was analysed by a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and researchers at Southampton, Durham, Bristol, and Aberystwyth universities and found to be a Canadian lynx  a carnivorous predator more than twice the size of a domestic cat. Co-author of the paper Darren Naish from the University of Southampton, says: &quot;There have been enough sightings of exotic big cats which substantially pre-date 1976 to cast doubt on the idea that one piece of legislation made in 1976 explains all releases of these animals in the UK. It seems more likely that escapes and releases have occurred throughout history, and that this continual presence of aliens explains the &apos;British big cat&apos; phenomenon.&quot; Would you like your university&apos;s research featured on the network?

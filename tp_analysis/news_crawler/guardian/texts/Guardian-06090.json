    "text": "Blood, sex and violence  the timing for Lollipop Chainsaw&apos;s release couldn&apos;t be worse, following a controversial E3, where excessive use of those elements was firmly in the spotlight. As such, the game&apos;s attempts at laughably over-the-top exploitation and blunt titillation feel awkward at best  or at worst, just flatly unfunny. You play as pumped-up cheerleader Juliet Starling, bizarrely qualified to hold off a horde of the undead thanks to coming from a family of zombie hunters. Armed with your boyfriend&apos;s sentient, decapitated head and the chainsaw of the title (lollipops are worked in as health top-ups) gameplay is a series of hack-and-slash stages set in and around San Romero high school. Chainsaw and cheerleading attacks can be blended together to take out enemies, dispatching them in showers of rainbows and sparkles. While combos are simple to remember, sluggish controls mean it&apos;s often luck rather than skill that pulls them off successfully. Level design is rote and linear, though occasional mini-games  such as basketball with zombie heads  offer a little saving grace. Gamers who have played Japanese lead designer Suda51&apos;s earlier efforts, particularly No More Heroes, will probably feel more at home with Lollipop Chainsaw&apos;s anarchic sensibilities and its endless stream of pop-culture references. It&apos;s largely a love letter to, or commentary on, American excess as seen from an outsider&apos;s perspective. While there&apos;s some merit in that, the finished product as a whole is just like its star: loud and colourful but lacking any depth. ",

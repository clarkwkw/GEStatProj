    "text": "Originally released last year as a series of staggered download-only episodes, this point-and-click game based on Back to the Future looked to prove that not all film adaptations had to be crass and pointless  risky business for a franchise that has high fan expectations. Here, the complete series is re-released at a competitive price of 14.99, on multiple platforms as a single retail package, but it still works best on PC, where graphics are sharpest and mouse controls most responsive. A classic point-and-click adventure, it picks up shortly after the film trilogy ends, as you play Marty McFly going back in time to 1930s prohibition-era America to save Doc from his latest pickle. The game rests on a fun plot and sharp dialogue in a beautifully recreated Hill Valley, with terrific voice acting featuring many from the original cast (Michael J Fox excluded), yet ultimately, it&apos;s sadly let down by lightweight in-game puzzles that lack invention and complexity. There&apos;s a fun blast through 80s Americana to be had here and it beats the average film tie-in, but it&apos;s unlikely to win any new fans.",

    "text": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team The iPhone is not the boss of phones anymore &gt;&gt; Wall St. Cheat Sheet  [Cannacord Genuity analyst Michael] Walkley wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday that his checks found that the Galaxy S III was the top selling handset at two of the three major US carriers: Verizon and Sprint. The iPhone 4S remained the top seller at AT&amp;T. At Verizon, the iPhone 4S fell to as low as third place, with Motorola&apos;s Razr Maxx taking the second spot.  However, Walkley expects Apple to recover as soon as the new model is out. &quot;We believe this is the first month since the iPhone 4S launched in October 2011 that it was not the top selling smartphone in the US market,&quot; he wrote. &quot;However, our checks indicated strong consumer interest and likely demand for the iPhone 5, and we believe Apple will return to strong number one smartphone share in the US post the iPhone 5 launch.&quot;  Clearly good news for Samsung, but might have non-Samsung Android manufacturers worried.

Why hasn&apos;t Yelp worked outside the USA? &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans  Yelp launched in the UK back in 2009 and smartphone penetration in the UK is not substantially below the USA. So what is it? &apos;Cultural&apos; is easy, but a cop out. Certainly, people in US cities do eat out more, but is that enough? Has Yelp just not pushed hard enough? Or maybe Americans are just keener to share their opinions (cf Zagat).   1 million Apple UDIDs allegedly leaked from FBI laptop &gt;&gt; Marco.org Marco Arment:    initially thought that Apple may owe us an explanation, but the last part of this description from the hackers is interesting:   ...[a file] with the name of &quot;NCFTA_iOS_devices_intel.csv&quot; turned to be a list of 12,367,232 Apple iOS devices including Unique Device Identifiers (UDID), user names, name of device, type of device, Apple Push Notification Service tokens, zipcodes, cellphone numbers, addresses, etc. the personal details fields referring to people appears many times empty leaving the whole list incompleted on many parts.   UDIDs, APNS tokens, and some contact info? All of this information could have been collected from an app transmitting data to a server.  Now looks like it was an app called AllClear ID. Still, 12m devices having their details leaked is quite a problem. Turkey to ban Twitter and Facebook &gt;&gt; New Europe  Social media could &quot;provoke great masses&quot;, said Binali Y?ld?r?m, Turkey&apos;s Transportation, Maritime and Communication Minister, when he announced that the country is planning to block access to Facebook and Twitter in order to prevent a &quot;threat to public safety.&quot;  In May, the Turkish government announced the new measure would take place in August and thousands of Turks concentrated in some 40 cities and towns around the country. Turkey&apos;s Internet regulator wanted to introduce a selection of filters that users would choose from before browsing the Internet. Also, some words could be banned, such as &quot;blond&quot; and &quot;sister-in-law&quot;.   There have been suspicions, which we&apos;ve been unable to confirm, that Turkey has attempted some internet filtering of content moving in and out of the country. The end of Android tablets: can Google match Amazon&apos;s success before Microsoft closes the window? &gt;&gt; The Verge  There are many reasons Google&apos;s massively successful phone operating system has basically fizzled on tablets - uninspiring hardware and bad third party software chief amongst them - but ultimately the biggest problem is the lack of a single Android tablet ecosystem worth anything to consumers. Launching a successful Android tablet on the merits of &quot;having an Android tablet&quot; alone has basically been a non-starter for everyone who&apos;s tried. Amazon&apos;s key insight with the Fire was to use Android as the means to enable another ecosystem that provides value to consumers, and everyone else is racing to adopt the same model - even Google. What is the Nexus 7 but a window into Google Play? If anything, the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire are the Android answer to the iPod touch, not the iPad - devices excellently suited to consuming media content and running phone apps, but not anywhere close to laptop replacements.  Nokia PureView chief slaps down Lumia 920 camera criticism &gt;&gt; SlashGear  &quot;As said many times before it&apos;s NOT about the number of pixels but what you do with them&quot; [Nokia photography expert Damian] Dinning pointed out, going on to argue that &quot;the future of photography will be about how you use pixels, optics and image processing together.&quot;  Contrary to those suggesting that a PureView Lumia would need considerably more than 8-megapixels in order to qualify, Dinning described the tech as more of a hybridization of multiple factors.

Could Google lose internet search supremacy to Amazon? | Metro.co.uk In general, the answer to any news headline that poses a question and ends in a questionmark is &quot;no&quot;. The piece is pretty incoherent - it&apos;s hard to know if it&apos;s talking about US, UK or European share - but one interesting point in this:   Whereas Amazon has its own app, Google is merely a search bar. Meanwhile, the growing popularity of Kindle devices increases Amazon&apos;s chances of being the first and only destination online.   Amazon does have a faint edge as the world gets app-ified. The expected dumping of Google Maps from the next Kindle Fire just amplifies this point. (Thanks @Knowles2 for the link.) Why isn&apos;t Android&apos;s web usage share higher? &gt;&gt; Fortune Tech  Net Applications, which monitors hits on its 40,000 client sites and weighs the results based on population statistics, issued a report Saturday that showed Apple&apos;s iOS dominating the mobile Web with a record 65.94% share. Android trailed far behind at 20.93%, although its growth year over year was faster (31% to 24.3% for iOS).  StatCounter, which doesn&apos;t count tablets as mobile devices and does not weigh its survey results as Net Applications does (&quot;We simply publish the data as we record it,&quot; its fact sheet boasts) showed Android retaking the lead it enjoyed briefly last summer (see chart below). According to StatCounter&apos;s latest survey, Android&apos;s Web share surged to 28% in August while iOS (without the iPad) drifted down to 24.5%.  Neither method is perfect - both have their vocal critics -- and adding the iPad into StatCounter&apos;s data would shift things significantly in Apple&apos;s favor. But why Android&apos;s Web share isn&apos;t higher in either survey remains a mystery.  Microsoft has WP8 locked so tight, even OEMs must learn about new features from Microsoft presentations &gt;&gt; Unwired View Eldar Murtazin of Mobile Review writes in Russian, so this is translated; he says WP8 is really locked down so not even OEMs can use them:   The closest analogy would be an artisan who is working on a body for a standard car chassis. He knows the size of the car, engine and transmission specs, but has no idea what a car interior will look like and what will they put inside. He knows that the interiors for every other artisan be the same and the only way for him to stand out - is to create the great finish/external covers. Furthermore, he will only learn how well his finish fits the overall car design at the last moment, when it is already to late to change anything.   (Thanks @fossilfuel for the link.)

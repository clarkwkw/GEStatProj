    "text": "Before Bright Simons became one of Africa&apos;s most dynamic technology innovators, he was an astrophysicist. He won a scholarship to Durham University but decided in the end that it was &quot;not sufficiently practical&quot;. &quot;I had been in student politics and I had this idea I could help change things,&quot; he says. He turned instead to migration studies, winning another EU scholarship, having decided that he wanted to help refugees. &quot;But I felt that even that wasn&apos;t practical enough.&quot; To change things effectively, he realised that he would have to return to Ghana and create his own enterprise. &quot;I realised I needed to become an entrepreneur. And I had no money. So I needed to find an area where I could make an impact without a lot of money. And that is where technology came in.&quot; His big realisation was that the greatest investment in technological infrastructure in Africa was coming from mobile telecom companies. &quot;They&apos;d invested a huge amount of money. All you needed was a good idea to convince them to give you access to this infrastructure.&quot; The good idea he came up with was to tackle the problem of counterfeit medicine. Fake pills and pharmaceuticals are a massive problem in the developing world. The World Health Organisation estimates that they account for 30% of all medicines on sale, and kill up to 2,000 people daily worldwide, though other studies suggest the figure is even higher. Simons&apos;s idea was to put a code on all packaging, enabling consumers to check if it was authentic or not with a simple text message. His organisation, mPedigree, now works with 20 telecoms companies and is in discussions with two dozen more. Its system has appeared on 6.5m packs of medicine and been adopted as the national standard in three different countries. Most exciting, perhaps, is that the system is now being taken beyond Africa. It&apos;s become a model for the industry in India and is being extended across south Asia. &quot;It&apos;s the first time that innovations from Africa are going to other parts of the world,&quot; says Simons. &quot;It&apos;s changing the traditional story about the continent and demonstrating that Africa can be the source of groundbreaking innovations. &quot;This is a genuine reversal of the usual narrative.&quot; Simons is hopeful that it&apos;s just the start. Innovation, he believes, has the power to transform Africa. &quot;And it&apos;s not going to be about shiny gimmickry as it often is in the west. It&apos;ll be about innovation that has an impact on human lives.&quot; It hasn&apos;t been easy going. The old stereotypes about Africa &quot;absolutely&quot; still exist. When it came to approaching multinationals, Simons encountered stiff resistance to the idea that innovation could come from Africa rather than go to it, added to which there &quot;is almost no institutional funding for innovation in Africa&quot;. There&apos;s no bank money, no aid money. And the greatest challenge is &quot;scale&quot;. &quot;There are a billion people in Africa. And the majority of them are young and they need jobs. We need to create the infrastructure to induce productivity. And this can&apos;t be done by micro-interventions. We need leadership. Better allocation of resources. New infrastructures.&quot; What Simons has shown is that it&apos;s not impossible. MPedigree has had an astonishing amount of success with very little resources. Studying in the UK, Simons says, gave him the confidence that entrepreneurs can change society. But it also &quot;made it obvious to me how peripheral Africa is on a global scale. It&apos;s what provided me with the impulse to return to the continent and reverse this narrative.&quot; Businesses  he most admires Ushahidi Kenyan developers who have created a crisis management platform. M-Pesa, a successful Kenyan mobile payments system, with 17 million subscribers in that country alone. Apopo, an NGO that uses African giant pouched rats to sniff out anti-personnel landmines and detect TB.",

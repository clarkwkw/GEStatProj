    "text": "Top academics are calling for a shake up of university degree grades in the wake of news that three-quarters of graduate recruiters routinely refuse applicants without a 2:1. According to a survey commissioned by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), 76% of graduate employers now use the grade as a minimum entry requirement; that&apos;s an increase of 3 percentage points since the last poll six months ago. The sharp divide in employment prospects between those with lower and upper second-class degrees has fuelled dissatisfaction with the current classification system. Some universities are considering the American Grade Point Average system (GPA), which takes an average of the marks gained across all years of study, giving the graduate a score between 0.0 and 4.0. Professor Mike Ewing, dean of students at University College London, says a pilot scheme of the GPA is underway. If it is a success, they could phase in the changes from as early as September 2013. Ewing says the present system is a blunt instrument: &quot;It&apos;s a three-point system: firsts, 2:1s, and everything else.&quot; He points out that just a few marks can separate students at each level: &quot;The current classifications are considered as a dividing line by employers, even though the border between grades can be decided by a few marks out of several thousand. The GPA system, on the other hand, quantifies every single part of the course.&quot; Professor Bob Burgess, vice chancellor of the University of Leicester, is also in favour of a shake-up in the grading system: &quot;The higher education committees which I have chaired have always expressed the need to collect information other than the result of the final degree.&quot; Burgess published a paper with Universities UK in 2007 that suggested another solution: the Higher Education Achievement Report (Hear). Unlike the GPA, this document would be handed out to students alongside their traditional degree classification. It includes a breakdown of the student&apos;s marks, along with information about their extracurricular achievements. Hear has been trialled across the UK, and 90 institutions have expressed an interest in using it. Burgess suggests that students could send this as part of a job application along with their CV, allowing potential employers to gain a fuller picture of their skills, irrespective of their final grade. &quot;Students want to reveal the full range of their achievements and abilities,&quot; he says. &quot;Our research has shown that employers appreciate that Hear allows them to match applicant&apos;s skills with the job for which they are applying.&quot; NUS president Liam Burns said: &quot;Employers are missing out if they only consider applicants based on a single final grade, and we need a move towards more detailed records of students&apos; time in higher education, their achievements, and the skills they acquire.&quot; &quot;Students also pick up many other transferable skills throughout their studies, and which are not necessarily reflected in their final grade. Their involvement in their students&apos; union, such as societies and sports clubs, can give them important additional experience which should not be overlooked.&quot; Despite bringing bad tidings for students who miss out on a 2:1, the survey has positive news: it finds that the average starting graduate salary is set to rise 2% higher than previously predicted, to 26,500. It also says the number of graduate jobs will dip only by a marginal 0.6%, suggesting gradual recovery in the market. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, stresses the more positive aspects of the report: &quot;There have been some very bleak headlines for graduates over recent years, so it is encouraging now to see real signs of recovery. Employers are investing in graduates which is good news for them and for current students.&quot;",

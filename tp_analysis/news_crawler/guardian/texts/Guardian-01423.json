    "text": "My life is in chaos. I have personal contact details, diary entries, and reminders spread across a Windows XP laptop, Mac desktop, iPad, and Nokia mobile phone (not to mention an old style paper diary and a separate paper address book). I need to rationalise all this information and, ideally, find a way of keeping my various devices in sync, but am debating how best to do this.As I use a number of Apple devices, one answer is to use the built in Apple apps and keep them in sync via iCloud. This has the attraction of simplicity, but as I am not a dedicated Mac-head, I am reluctant to lock myself into the Apple world. Google provides an obvious alternative, but would not keep my devices in sync. I&apos;m also a little nervous about giving Google even more access to my personal data.Can you, or your readers, suggest any alternatives. Danny Golding For more than a decade, this question had a simple answer: you put everything into Microsoft Outlook, and everything else synchronised with that. At the time, some mobile devices came bundled with a free copy of Outlook, so this was a good solution even for people who didn&apos;t use Microsoft Office. Today, Outlook is still the standard answer for businesses that use Microsoft Office on Windows PCs, which means most of them. However, the trend is towards more lightweight, consumer-oriented online applications, and Outlook synchronisation is much less common. Most people don&apos;t need more than 100 fields for each contact name, including fields for the names of the contact&apos;s manager and assistant, which Outlook provides. Nor do they need room for multiple email addresses, fax machines, and websites. Often, they just want the person&apos;s name, company name, and room for a couple of phone numbers. If you want to take the lightweight route, then the obvious solutions are Google, Apple&apos;s iCloud, and Microsoft Live. All offer some degree of cross-platform support, but Google is the one most likely to support both PCs and Macs equally well. Of course, you don&apos;t have to decide immediately, or ever. There&apos;s no reason why you can&apos;t use two systems to see which you like best. Indeed, the second service will provide a useful backup. Desktop email programs usually support more than one email account, so you could sign up for both Google&apos;s Gmail (with access to related programs, including Google Docs) and Microsoft&apos;s Hotmail (where the related programs include the online versions of Microsoft Office programs). Microsoft Live Mail does the job well, but the latest Windows Live Essentials 2011 suite, with Live Mail and Live Mesh cross-platform synchronisation software, doesn&apos;t run on Windows XP. Mozilla&apos;s Thunderbird email program and Lightning calendar provide an open source alternative. If you really want to put everything into a single program  including to-do lists, journal entries, notes and a full calendar  then you need a personal information manager or PIM. This used to be a hot product category, but now I suspect there are only a few realistic options. Outlook is the main example, but Time &amp; Chaos 7, Pimero and EssentialPIM might be worth a look. There&apos;s also the open source Evolution, which attempts to provide an Outlook substitute for Linux and Windows. Microsoft Outlook includes an email client (though you don&apos;t have to use it) whereas PIMs such as Time &amp; Chaos more often link to your existing email client. However, if you want integrated email, the Chaos Intellect version provides it. Chaos Software also offers the Chaos Host service for $99 (63) per year. The company says: &quot;In addition to synchronising with our desktop programs, ChaosHost.com also supports many of the newest smartphones for Over-The-Air synchronisation, including iOS (iPhone), Google Android, Windows Mobile, and Palm Pre!&quot; The more recent Pimero has a free version that appears to offer most of the features you need, but you will have to upgrade to the Standard (44.87) or Professional (63.18) edition to get automatic synchronisation and synchronisation with the iPhone and iPad, Google Android, BlackBerry and Windows Mobile. With Outlook, you can also get extra features by paying for a service such as Google Apps for Business or Microsoft&apos;s Office 365, and Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) capability is a feature to look for. Google Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook will sync your email, calendar and contacts in both directions. Unfortunately, it does not sync notes, tasks, journal entries or distribution lists, thought there is now a gadget for Outlook Tasks. There are independent programs that fill other holes at extra cost, such as gSyncit v3.x, which will sync tasks and notes. There are other useful apps in the Google Apps Marketplace. Microsoft&apos;s Office 365 is a more powerful and better integrated suite than Google Apps. It provides a hosted version of Microsoft Exchange Server so, in theory, setting it up is mainly a matter of adding an Office 365 email account to Outlook 2007 or 2010. Once that&apos;s done, the calendar, tasks etc should synchronise as well. However, there are several downloads to install before you &quot;set up your desktop for Office 365&quot;. I haven&apos;t tried it yet, but I&apos;d be amazed if it didn&apos;t include numerous traps for the unwary. Either way, the videos at Office 365: A tour for users will help you decide if it&apos;s worth signing up for a free 30-day trial. If you are not a business professional, I suspect neither Google Apps for Business nor Office 365 is worth the effort. You could also consider a free option, the Zoho online office suite. Again, it&apos;s aimed at business users, but at least it has a Contacts application. There&apos;s also a Wiki that you could use as a diary workspace. It looks better than Google Docs, but Zoho + Google Apps lets you combine the two. By this stage, there ought to be some good online PIMs like Time &amp; Chaos but, apart from Pimero, they seem to be in short supply. I suspect that most people, like me, use a mixture of things including Google and Windows Live and web-based apps such as Evernote, Toodledo, Springpad, Highrise and others too numerous to mention. However, maybe readers can point us both to a better, more integrated solution. Whatever you choose, bear in mind that having a something that&apos;s nice to use is ultimately much less important than something that will export your irreplaceable data in a re-usable format. Phones, laptops and websites last only a few years before they are replaced or upgraded, but your personal information needs to survive for decades.",

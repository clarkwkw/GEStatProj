    "text": "  Harlan&apos;s red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis harlani (synonyms, Buteo harlani and Buteo borealis harlani; protonym, Falco Harlani), also known as Harlans hawk, photographed at Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, Anahuac, Texas (North America).  Image: Joseph Kennedy, 27 January 2012 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorize].Nikon D200, Kowa 883 telescope with TSN-PZ camera eyepiece 1/1000s f/8.0 at 1000.0mm iso400    Question: This lovely North American bird has been split and lumped several times and is likely to be split once more. Heyyy, wait a minute, what&apos;s this &quot;lump&quot; and &quot;split&quot; business? What am I talking about? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Can you tell me which characters are the basis for splitting this bird? Is this an immature or adult bird? Response: This is an dark morph immature Harlan&apos;s red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis harlani. This (sub)species has been elevated to full species status (&quot;split&quot;) and subsumed into the red-tailed hawk taxon as a subspecies (&quot;lumped&quot;) several times now, reflecting our lack of understanding about this taxon and our ongoing confusion as to what is a species. Currently, this subspecies is a candidate for a split again, a decision that will likely be enacted quite soon. When that occurs, this species will once again be known as Harlan&apos;s hawk, Buteo harlani. However, until a rigorous DNA study has been completed on the red-tailed/Harlan&apos;s/Krider&apos;s hawk species complex, these taxa will be split and lumped repeatedly in the future.  Before we get into the nitty-gritty of identifying this bird, it&apos;s helpful to make an educated guess as to the bird&apos;s approximate age. Fortunately, this is probably the easiest trait on this bird to interpret. The individual in this photograph has pale yellow eyes, indicating this is an immature bird since adults of both taxa have pale brown eyes.  Harlan&apos;s hawks breed in Alaska and northwestern Canada, and winter in the western USA and on the southern Great Plains of North America. This very dark raptor has a marbled white, brown, and gray tail instead of rufous.  The bird in the photograph is very dark, so how do we know it&apos;s a Harlan&apos;s hawk and not a dark morph red-tailed hawk? Here&apos;s a few characters that help with this tricky ID:  immature Harlan&apos;s hawks have dusky tails, rarely with any rufous colouring. In rare individuals, if there is any hint of rufous colouring, it is present as a pale wash. Roughly half of the adults will have at least some rufous colouring on their tails, typically as a band near the tip  Harlan&apos;s hawks have many dark bands on their tails, with an especially bold subterminal tail band  Harlan&apos;s hawk wingtips clearly do not reach as far as the end of their tails when perched  dark and intermediate morph Harlan&apos;s hawks can be distinguished by the amount of mottling on its upperwing coverts: dark morphs lack this mottling  the dark areas of Harlan&apos;s hawks are a blackish brown, lacking any warm rufous tones, except perhaps in the tail  Harlan&apos;s hawks have variable amounts of white speckling, whilst red-tailed hawks have buff speckles  some research indicates that Harlan&apos;s hawks have shorter tarsi than red-tailed hawks, but I was unable to track down and cite this work for you (also keep in mind that such measurements are impossible to get in the field on a live bird anyway!) I also should point out that Harlan&apos;s hawks have dark, intermediate and -- rarely -- light morphs, as do red-tailed hawks. If that isn&apos;t complicated enough for you, Harlan&apos;s hawks and red-tailed hawks will interbreed where their ranges overlap, producing intermediate forms that run the gamut in colouring.

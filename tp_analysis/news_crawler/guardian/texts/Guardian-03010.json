    "text": "     Dante is back  and now we have some rather scintillating new imagery. As revealed at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show, the goth rock demon slayer is to be reborn after four varyingly successful adventures. In a collaboration between UK studio Ninja Theory and Capcom&apos;s R&amp;D division, DmC: Devil May Cry takes us back to the roots of the series, exploring the early years of the smart-jiving protagonist. Here&apos;s the first trailer from the forthcoming PS3 and Xbox title. It shows Dante sparring demonic foes in an abandoned fun fair, while a rightwing religious news channel calls for his execution. The whole thing looks a lot more... American, with a younger, prettier lead and lots more Hollywood bad boy dialogue. Once again, the combat system combines pistols and swords and there look to be some rather histrionic juggle combos allowing you to go totally Fruit Ninja on falling enemies. Although Cambridge-based Ninja Theory (Heavenly Sword, Enslaved) is taking on most of the development duties, the project is being overseen by Hedeaki Itsuno who worked on all four of the previous instalments, so we can expect a certain amount of continuity  though we&apos;re hoping the Ninja Theory team get to put plenty of their own spin on things; especially with the depth of the third-person combat mechanic.  Take a look, anyway, and let us know what you think. The release date is TBA, but we can expect to find out more at this summer&apos;s E3.",

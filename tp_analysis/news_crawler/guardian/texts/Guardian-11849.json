    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Streets Of Rage was an early-90s game in which you strolled through city streets laying waste to a steady flow of assailants via button mashing. Ninja Gaiden is its spiritual successor, and while the urban scenery and multiple attackers remain, it demands a bit more rigour than simply stabbing buttons; slipping out of the way of incoming bullets, knives and guided missiles is an indispensable part of your armoury. You can chop off enemies&apos; limbs, sousing the screen in even more claret than before, and there are new upgradeable weapons and abilities as well as a section where you play as Ayane from the Dead Or Alive series. Other than that, it&apos;s business as usual, which means super-fast combat accompanied by your ninja&apos;s Tourette&apos;s-like stream of staccato profanity, absolutely terrible Japanese rock music, and a brutally hard difficulty level that marks a return to the franchise&apos;s cliff-like learning curve. Gruelling and repetitive it may be, but for the right kind of masochist, there is magic to be eked out.",

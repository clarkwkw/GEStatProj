    "text": "This week on Tech Weekly with Aleks Krotoski and Guardian technology editor Charles Arthur, we meet Charles Davies, co-founder of the award winning tech start-up iGeolise, to discuss why time and not distance is important in providing travel information and building local applications. Aleks and Charles also discuss if Windows 8 is a pitch for the yummy-mummy market and home secretary Theresa May defends the Data and Communications Bill or the snooping bill as it makes its way through the legislative channels. Finally the Guardian&apos;s digital media correspondent Jemima Kiss drops in on the recent Decode conference in London where she discovers the future of retail tech.",

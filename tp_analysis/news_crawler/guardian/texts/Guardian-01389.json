    "text": "With the PlayStation Vita&apos;s 22 February launch rapidly approaching, and review machines running many of the launch games already in the hands of journalists, Sony&apos;s next-generation handheld is now very much a known quantity  and first impressions are very good indeed. But we were lucky enough to get an unprecedented insight into how the PS Vita came into being, what shaped it and what Sony expects from it when we attended its Japanese launch in late December 2011. Among the key personnel we spoke to in Tokyo were Takashi Sogabe, the PS Vita&apos;s designer, and Shuhei Yoshida who, as worldwide studios president at Sony Computer Entertainment, is in ultimate charge of Sony&apos;s in-house game development. PS Vita design secrets Sogabe proved to be a fascinating character. A 27-year veteran at Sony, it turns out he was the man who designed an object that was the most iconic gadget of its time: the Walkman. &quot;Originally, I was given a piece of wood, and asked to create the Walkman at that size,&quot; he said. More recently, he has worked on Vaio laptops and the PSP 3000. He candidly admitted that, as with any gadget, design compromises had to be made with the PS Vita. &quot;Speaking not only about the PS Vita, we always have a battle between engineers and designers,&quot; Sogabe said. &quot;The original design of the PS Vita, for example, was very much thinner than the current retail product. From a designer&apos;s point of view, thinner is better-looking, but the engineers wanted to put all the features in. Maybe it will become thinner in the future, but the engineers would have to come up with a means to do that.&quot; Surprisingly, he singled out the seemingly prosaic dual analogue sticks as the biggest challenge when designing the PS Vita. &quot;We had been developing the idea of dual analogue sticks for a long time  the PSP used slide pads,&quot; he said. &quot;Making analogue sticks this small required very much effort on the engineering side, so we are very proud of this technology  it was very difficult to design.&quot; Regarding the Vita&apos;s similarity in appearance to the PSP, he said: &quot;We like that you think it looks similar, because we wanted to keep the identity of the PSP, but to evolve the design and brush it up. We came up with various patterns, including a clamshell one. Then we discussed it with a lot of publishers and settled on this shape.&quot; Finally, Sogabe raised the tantalising prospect that one of the PS Vita&apos;s most highly praised aspects, its 5in AMOLED touch-screen, could have been even bigger. &quot;The PSP had a 4.3in screen, but we knew the PS Vita would have a higher resolution,&quot; he said. &quot;So a 4.3in screen would have less impact than if the screen was bigger. There was a lot of discussion, and we came up with five inches as being best. We also had an idea to make a 5.5in screen, but we had to think about operability, as it is a portable device.&quot; Yoshida: keeping the Vita games flowing Shuhei Yoshida is Sony Computer Entertainment&apos;s man in charge when it comes to first-party games the company publishes on all platforms. He is refreshingly willing to admit past mistakes and detail attempts not to repeat them, rather than retreating under the comfort blanket of the party line. He admitted, for instance, that the PSP suffered through launching just a year before the PS3. &quot;The jump from the PS2 to the PS3 was a huge challenge, so we had to increase the resources of all the teams moving from PS2 to PS3. There was a lot of staffing going on for the PS3, and unfortunately, that happened just after the launch of the PSP. &quot;But that&apos;s not happening this time around. PS3 is selling very well, so we have a stable platform there, and now we are adding the PS Vita, we are, of course, shifting some resources around from PSP development. So compared to the rampup challenge that we had working with the PSP and PS3, we are in much better shape. And of course, we have increased the overall resources from five or six years ago.&quot; He was heartened that third-party publishers seem to have embraced the PS Vita, professing surprise that there will be as many as 33 games available at the UK launch: &quot;I had no idea there were so many games targeted by third parties. Up until a couple of days before the Tokyo Games Show, I was working on the draft of my presentation, and talking about six or seven PS Vita titles. &quot;Then I looked and said: &apos;What? Are you sure that&apos;s for the launch, rather than the launch window?&apos; As far as first-party games are concerned, we have many in the pipeline. So we are strategically spreading them out so that there will be a constant supply, because we don&apos;t have control over when third-party titles are released  sometimes we have to fill in the gaps with our titles.&quot; AR comes of age Yoshida also hinted that, in some respects, Sony is keeping the PS Vita&apos;s powder dry. He showed a demo of so-called Markerless Augmented Reality in which, by merely pointing the PS Vita at the packaging of Everybody&apos;s Golf, one of the game&apos;s cartoon-style characters magically appeared. He reckons the PS Vita will be the first machine to bring some credibility to AR: &quot;We&apos;ve been doing AR with PSP, with things like Invizimals, which uses one card,&quot; he said. &quot;That was very cute and nice, especially for kids, but when you actually play it, it&apos;s very easy to lose sight of the card, then the character disappears. But using multiple cards, it&apos;s very difficult to lose all the cards. &quot;If the PS Vita only sees two or three out of six, for example, it remembers where the other cards are in relation to those ones. So you get a very consistent, robust games experience. As far as we are concerned, the AR in PSP was a good start but the AR in the PS Vita has way, way more potential. We have some very cool ideas about how to get our AR cards in the hands of consumers.&quot; Cross-play rivals the Wii U     PlayStation Vita ... Sony has an impressive lineup of launch titles    Plus, Yoshida said, there are other technological aspects of the PS Vita that Sony has so far been keeping a lid on, or at least not showing in their full glory, such as cross-play, the ability to link up for online gaming with the PS3. &quot;There are many different styles of connectivity,&quot; he said. &quot;With Wipeout 2048, for example, you have real-time network play: that&apos;s one example of cross-play. With LittleBigPlanet, there is a slightly more involved style of connectivity. It hasn&apos;t necessarily been publicised, but what we are talking about is that any character or item that you have on PS3, you can download and use on the PS Vita version. &quot;There&apos;s more in development, but you&apos;ll have to wait a bit before we show it. One of the tech-demos that we showed at TGS was using PS Vita as a controller for PS3, and we used LittleBigPlanet as an example. So that kind of thing is very exciting.&quot; And it also sounds very similar to what Nintendo is doing with the Wii U: &quot;When Nintendo announced Wii U, we were kind of surprised, because we&apos;ve been doing that sort of similar tech using PS3 and PSP. We can render PS3 images through a network to PSP. I understand that Wii U works similarly  the console renders images to the portable. &quot;So it was very natural for us to extend it and enhance it for PS Vita, because PS Vita has a much better screen, is more powerful and the connectivity speed is much better than PSP. This is something we&apos;d like to maintain for the future. There are so many things that PS Vita can do, but let&apos;s not try to cram everything into the launch period.&quot; Changing practices Finally, Yoshida went into some detail about how Sony has worked hard to get the all-important third-party developer community onside to a much greater extent than it was in the early days of the PS and PS3. &quot;The company has changed. When Kaz Hirai took over, he demanded that the hardware team integrate with our studio teams, specifically for the process of developing the hardware,&quot; he said. &quot;Actually, we have many of our tech groups in our studio working on the software SDK for the PS Vita. And some of the SDKs were developed by our internal studio teams, because they know games better. We talked about how difficult it was to get hold of PS3 devkits early  part of the problem was that they were gigantic machines, very intimidating, noisy and hot. &quot;But because we were involved with designing the hardware for Vita, our teams managed to make the devkit very small, like the actual Vita. That was a challenge for the hardware team, and they did a great job. Vita has many unique UIs and, if you remember the PSP devkit had a very thick cable.&quot; So, is that new philosophy one that Sony is carrying forwards for the PlayStation 4? &quot;I don&apos;t know what you are talking about. We are still very excited by the PlayStation 3.&quot;",

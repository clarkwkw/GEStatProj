    "text": "What could be more perfect than the weather yesterday and again this morning? As I walked through the meadows I found the grass heavy with dew. In the garden the air was full of the scent of wallflowers and white rock, both now in perfection of bloom. We have some large patches of white rock, and as usual they are attracting hundreds of hive bees. As my bee-keeping neighbour is removing to a far country, I am interested to see if the honey-gathering in our garden will decrease or even cease. Some tell me that we shall perceive no change, as where honey is to be got bees will come, even if ten miles away. I sincerely hope that our representatives in Parliament will render Mr. Runciman every assistance possible when, on behalf of the Board of Agriculture, he brings forward the bill by which it is hoped that we may stamp out the bee disease. This unfortunate trouble has spread so far that if the now important industry of bee-keeping is to prosper no time should be lost in passing the bill and using the powers conferred. The bill enables the Board of Agriculture to make orders similar to those enforced, when necessary, under the Diseases of Animals Act.    ",

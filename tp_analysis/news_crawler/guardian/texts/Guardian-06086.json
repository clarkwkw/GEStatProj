    "text": "A course that helps teachers of English exploit digital content in class has won the Excellence in Course Innovation category at the British Council&apos;s 2012 ELTons awards. The Bell Blended Learning in ELT course is due to be launched by the UK teacher training institution this year and according to its designer, Nik Peachey, it will help teachers to manage digital overload and to use a range of applications to organise and get the most out of open-source content. The course is based on a 10-week online module followed by two weeks of intensive face-to-face training in the UK. Peachey says that participants will be encouraged to find resources that are relevant to their teaching and then investigate how they can use them effectively. &quot;Teachers are building their personal learning networks through social media, but what they are finding is that the material is multiplying and they need strategies for handling it efficiently. We will be developing teachers&apos; tools for processing and organising that digital information,&quot; Peachey said.",

    "text": "Beyond the razzmatazz of the pier and amusement arcades lies a quieter seaside attraction that escaped the attention of most visitors who flocked to this north Lincolnshire resort during the recent heatwave. The sand dunes in the local nature reserve host a fine display of marsh orchids. We counted over 200 of their conical magenta inflorescences in one flowery dune slack that was no larger than a tennis court. Peacock, small tortoiseshell and common blue butterflies, shimmering in a mirage of midday heat, flitted among them but their attention seemed mainly drawn to vetches, hawkweeds and hay rattle blooms, rather than the orchids&apos; densely packed floral temptations. A check inside the flowers revealed that in most the pollinia  the paired stamens that are inadvertently collected by butterflies and moths, and carried in their entirety between flowers  were intact. Charles Darwin, in his study of orchid pollination, called these &quot;beautiful contrivances&quot; and described how to mimic the action of a butterfly&apos;s proboscis by poking a sharp pencil into the flower&apos;s nectar spur, then withdrawing it with a sticky pollinium attached. I followed his instructions, but with a fine twig, and extracted a pollinium, a tiny club-shaped package of pollen that the orchid had advertised with so much floral extravagance and offered with a nectar reward for any visitor that could be conned into carrying it away. I watched this &quot;beautiful contrivance&quot; until the extracted pollinium, first vertical, slowly bent forward in the sun&apos;s heat, just as Darwin said, until it was perfectly positioned to contact a receptive stigma when carried to another flower. So why had the butterflies collected so few pollinia? Darwin had an answer. He counted the individual pollen grains in a single pollinium and found each contained enough to sire over 120,000 seeds. A few successful collections among this dense orchid floral display would be enough. Such is the profligacy of natural selection.",

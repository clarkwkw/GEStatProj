    "text": "2013 sees the 25th anniversary of the Education Reform Act, which brought in the national curriculum and its associated assessment system. Sadly, what was intended to be a &quot;broad and balanced entitlement curriculum&quot;, providing a progressive structure and opportunities for all pupils to develop as learners, has degenerated into a means for ranking pupils and schools. Both main political parties in government over that period are equally to blame. The Thatcher administration quickly reduced teacher-based assessment to a subsidiary role, powerless against the publicity accorded the Sat levels. Blair, sensing political capital and supported by his advisers, further disempowered teachers by introducing a &quot;this is how, what and when you will teach&quot; set of strategies designed to ramp up test scores in the so-called basics  in short: look, scores are improving on my watch. His goal of life-long learners was quaintly addressed by introducing measures which reduced teachers to &quot;deliverers&quot; and learners to passive recipients. Tinkering continues under Michael Gove, with academies, Teach First and training schools, the current panacea  all with the same focus: improving scores in tests and examinations as the basis for value judgments. My wish for 2013 is that those involved in policy decisions which affect learning opportunities and progress, and ultimately, life chances of pupils, address the issue of deregulation: deregulating teachers from delivering test-preparation focused lessons, and deregulating pupils from being passive recipients, both required to deliver acceptable prescribed outcomes for measurement purposes.Professor Bill BoyleChair of educational assessment, University of Manchester",

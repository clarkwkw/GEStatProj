    "text": "You report (Watchdog to investigate 4G sell-off, 15 April) the National Audit Office&apos;s decision to conduct a value-for-money study into the 4G spectrum auction. We are pleased that this will happen, as it will provide a good opportunity to examine how we conducted an efficient auction. The auction outcome will support competition, with five different companies able to launch 4G services. It will also lead to investment in new services, greater innovation and enhanced coverage through an obligation to provide services to almost all of the UK population by 2017 at the latest. We designed and conducted the auction to meet our duties under primary legislation. This was established in 2003 under the previous Labour government and has been supported by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. This requires Ofcom to maximise benefits to the public by securing the efficient use of the spectrum. It does not require Ofcom to maximise auction receipts. This is understandable, since such a short-term objective could come at considerable cost to longer-term and more important goals, including competition and widespread coverage. The approach we took will ensure that the long-term benefits to the UK will far outweigh revenue raised from the auction.Ed RichardsCEO, Ofcom  It&apos;s good to see the National Audit Office investigating the recent 4G auction, which fell spectacularly behind its predicted revenue target. We urged the government to ensure value for money for the taxpayer and were astounded at the 1bn shortfall. 1bn is a serious amount of money to be out of pocket by. Why did the government think it was going to get that much money and why wasn&apos;t there a reserve price? Auctions can be risky but should never be allowed to be as damaging as that. Private companies are too often allowed to get their hands on state assets for a bargain price, leaving public finances out of pocket. Public finances need to be carefully managed, now more than ever. We sincerely hope the government learns from this episode and doesn&apos;t hastily sell off more family silver in the pursuit of a quick buck.Billy HayesGeneral secretary, CWU",

    "text": "The latest iteration of SimCity continues to take a drubbing, after Electronic Arts insisted players connect to its servers in order to play. The side effect of this draconian anti-piracy measure was that vast numbers couldn&apos;t actually play the game for days at a time, a situation that got even more embarrassing when a player hacked it to work offline, making its publisher&apos;s claim that essential parts of the game&apos;s processing were performed centrally into a very public whopper. Other games out this week include Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory (PS3), a baffling, text-heavy role-playing game that parodies the Japanese games industry but suffers from lacklustre translation and its innate strangeness, while The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct (Xbox, PS3, Wii U) detaches itself from the award-winning adventure games based on the TV series to deliver an action-orientated first-person zombie shooter.",

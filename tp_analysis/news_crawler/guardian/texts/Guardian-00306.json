    "text": "Archaeology A-level, along with art history (Letters, 17 October) and many other arts and humanities-based subjects, has been completely removed as an option by the exam board AQA. This is a great blow for our education, arts and heritage sectors, and will have an impact on both university numbers and candidature for jobs in heritage, an area worth millions to Britain and supporting 113,000 direct and 157,000 indirect jobs. AQA itself has said that the subject is one of the most exciting it offers, whereas many professional archaeological units and academic departments have expressed disdain at the decision, stating that more archaeologists will be required in the future, due to large projects such as HS2 and situations such as Brexit. This country prides itself on variety and diversity of education. The removal of this popular, important and worthwhile qualification, among many others, is worthy of attention alongside the also regrettable removal of art history A-level. A petition to reinstate archaeology A-level can be found here.Claire JohnsonLecturer in archaeology &amp; ancient history, Gower College Swansea  Join the debate  email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",

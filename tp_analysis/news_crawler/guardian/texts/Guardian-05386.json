    "text": "I was surprised to learn that the Russians recognize two different colours of blue,  (siniy; dark blue) and  (goluboy; light blue), whereas the ancient Greeks didn&apos;t have any words at all for blue. In fact, if you&apos;ve read either of the great epics, Iliad or Odyssey, you&apos;ll notice that the poetically eloquent Homer had an unexpectedly sparse colour vocabulary. Does this mean that Homer lived in a relatively colourless world?  These intriguing observations led British statesman and Homeric scholar, William Ewart Gladstone, to &quot;launch a thousand ships of learning&quot; when more than 150 years ago he proposed that the Greeks were partially colour-blind. This peculiar hypothesis has had a profound effect on the development of three academic disciplines and triggered a debate that continues to this day: Does the language you speak affect or reflect how you perceive and think about the world? This recasting of the nature/nurture debate has kept scholars engaged in verbal arm-wrestling contests to this very day, a theme that author Guy Deutscher explores at length in his book, Through the Language Glass: Why The World Looks Different In Other Languages [2011: Arrow Books; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US].    The first section of the book, entitled &quot;The Language Mirror&quot;, provides an overview of the practical reasons why words for individual colors appear in a consistent order across human languages. Words for black and white appear first since night and day are the most obvious events in a human&apos;s daily life and they present the strongest contrasts. The word for red then follows, since blood is red, and this is the next most important colour as humans regularly engage in warfare, hunting, childbirth and other bloody exercises. Colour names for yellow and green emerge later in many cultures due to the influence of agriculture and the need to specifically signify ripe or unripe grains and fruits. Then finally, the word for blue typically pops up.  This orderly semantic progression sets the stage for a prolonged examination of whether our mother tongue affects our colour perception. For example, if the sea is &quot;wine-coloured&quot; as Homer asserted, or if there is no word-name distinguishing green from yellow or green from blue in a particular language, can the speakers of that language perceive these colours? A separate section containing colour plates anchors this discussion, but overall, I found the shades of grey in this line of argument to be tedious and circular. Further, how the brain processes neural colour input is far more complex than Deutscher ever lets on, although he briefly revisits his colour idea at the end of the book to let us know that he probably shouldn&apos;t have discussed the colour example at all. Ho hum. The second section of the book, &quot;The Language Lens&quot;, segues into an investigation of word gender (or type) in languages. Some languages do not have gender at all (e.g. the Finno-Ugric branch), whilst some are gender neutral (e.g. English), others have masculine, feminine and neuter genders (the Romance and Germanic languages) whilst still others have a plethora of additional genders, such as human/animal/canine/vegetable/drinks/liquids/mineral, etc. After introducing and attempting to explain the logic of gender assignment for particular words (an impossible task to do properly), the author then asks whether the gender of an object&apos;s name word affects how we think about those objects? Deutscher, a native Hebrew speaker, illustrates this idea using an example translated from Hebrew:  Out of the masculine window I can see the masculine trees and on them the birds, which are feminine regardless of the accident of their anatomy. If I knew more about (feminine) ornithology, I could tell by looking at each bird what biological sex she was. I would point at her and explain to the less initiated: &apos;You can tell she is a male because of that red spot on her chest and also because she is larger than the females.&apos; And I would not feel there was anything remotely strange about that. [p. 204]  Is that so strange? This is no more strange than ships retaining their feminine gender in English until, well, the publishing industry formally neutralised that charming little holdout in previous decade or so.  Deutscher goes on to discuss a number of psychological experiments designed to get at this fundamental gender/perception question. For example, native Spanish speakers are more likely perceive bridges (el puente; masculine gender) as being particularly big, strong or dangerous whilst native German speakers are more likely to perceive bridges (die Brcke; feminine gender) as elegant, fragile and slender. The second half of the book, particularly Deutscher&apos;s discussion of gender and perception, was far more interesting and compelling than his prolonged expos on colour, in my opinion. But it is a relief that, in the end, Deutscher concludes with what most of the rest of us already knew: neither the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (language determines one&apos;s worldview) nor the Pinker hypothesis (language has no effect on one&apos;s worldview) can fully answer this nature (brain) versus nurture (culture) debate. In short, it&apos;s a little of both.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

It will be the first of many products that come out of that company, which has a brilliant CEO and engineering team.&quot;  On Teens and iPhones &gt;&gt; The Axx Alex Guyot, 17-year-old attendee at CDO High School in Tuscon, Arizonia, following on from the in-some-quarters doubted survey by Piper Jaffray about US teens&apos; eagerness to get iPhones (saying 48% had one, 62% planned to get one as their next mobile, 23% expect to buy an Android) :   Overall, Apple has simply done an amazing job at entrenching themselves in the minds and hearts of teenagers. Despite the results of any studies or articles saying otherwise, I can easily assert that the demand for iPhones from the teenage audience is in no way waning. In fact, more teens seem to want iPhones than ever before. Certainly there is still a presence of Android owners, which while clearly not as large as the number of students with iPhones, is still a competitive force, but the loyalty of this presence to it&apos;s chosen operating system seems to be shrinking much faster than it&apos;s growing. Android isn&apos;t in any danger of extinction in this high school&apos;s population, but the dominance of the iPhone is blatantly obvious.  What I learned about mobile in China &gt;&gt; Robert Scoble on Google+ -  In China I met several entrepreneurs and others at the Bluetooth World conference there. China has a very different mobile culture, so thought I&apos;d share what I learned here:  Truly fascinating on iPhones, Android, and BlackBerry and Windows Phone, as well as the firewall, VPNs and jailbreaking. A must-read, along with other data points in the comments. (Thanks @vassal for the link.) Bernstein ponders lengthening PC cycle &gt;&gt; Barrons.com  Tablets and smartphones aren&apos;t replacing PCs, says [Bernstein Research&apos;s Toni] Sacconaghi, but they are likely &quot;lengthening the replacement cycle&quot; as they cut into some of the PC&apos;s workload and make their replacement less urgent. This could last a bit before things stabilize: About 360M PCs were sold in 2011; of which we estimate that 75% were replacement PCs, or about 270M. If the average replacement cycle increases over time from 4 to 5 years, annual replacement units would drop by 20% over time to 216M, a decline of 54M from the prevailing run rate. In 2012, total PC units fell 3% or about 12M units in total, and if down 6% in CY13 it would represent another ~21M units, suggesting that this lengthening replacement cycle could continue to have a toll on PC market volumes going forward. Regarding HP&apos;s big 24% unit decline in the quarter, Sacconaghi writes that it may be because HP didn&apos;t slash prices.  Dell did better (in share terms) because it has a smaller consumer mix. Sacconaghi&apos;s numbers also suggest a PC market where the installed base is close to peaking. (Thanks @rquick for the link.) The Economist explains: How might your choice of browser affect your job prospects? &gt;&gt; The Economist  Among other things, its analysisfound that those applicants who have bothered to install new web browsers on their computers (such as Mozilla&apos;s Firefox or Google&apos;s Chrome) perform better and stay in their posts for 15% longer, on average, than those who use the default pre-installed browser that came with their machine (ie, Internet Explorer on a Windows PC and Safari on an Apple Mac). This may simply be a coincidence, but Evolv&apos;s analysts reckon that applicants&apos; willingness to go to the trouble of installing a new browser shows decisiveness, a valuable trait in a potential employee.  Presents a problem for Chromebook users wanting to impress. (Thanks @vassal for the link.) Why don&apos;t cell phones have a dialtone? &gt;&gt; Dan Goldin  While reading The Idea Factory, I came across an interesting passage that explained why cell phones don&apos;t have dialtones:  Meanwhile, Phil Porter, who had worked with [Richard] Frenkiel on the original system, came up with a permanent answer to an interesting question. Should a cellular phone have a dial tone? Porter made a radical suggestion that it shouldn&apos;t. A caller should dial a number and then push &quot;send.&quot; That way, the mobile caller would be less rushed; also, the call would be connected for a shorter time, thus putting less strain on the network. That this ideadial, then sendwould later prove crucial to texting technology was not even considered.  It&apos;s amazing that although this suggestion was made in 1971, we&apos;re leveraging it more than 40 years later with text messaging. How many other technologies and businesses are built on top of SMS that wouldn&apos;t have existed without this decision? I&apos;m sure an SMS-like technology would have come along regardless of this decision but it still makes me wonder how significantly past technological decisions influence us in the present.  Microsoft looks like being next with two-factor authentication &gt;&gt; Naked Security Paul Ducklin, on what look like leaked screenshots of Microsof&apos;s 2FA:   It&apos;s not clear exactly what the &quot;Don&apos;t ask me for a code&quot; tickbox is for, but it looks as though you will be able to exempt your most commonly-used device (say, your day-to-day laptop) from needing 2FA-protected logins. I hope that&apos;s not the case, because 2FA adds real value if you use it as a matter of routine, not if you use it only in special cases. Sure, you can argue that an oft-used and cherished laptop is less likely to get you into trouble with a keylogger than, say, a PC in an internet cafe or a kiosk at the airport. But if you care about security, you won&apos;t read your email, personal or business, on kiosks or in internet cafes at all. And if you genuinely cherish that oft-used laptop, and your oft-used accounts, you&apos;ll want only the best levels of security every time you use them.  Crazy question #4  Can Google Docs replace Microsoft Office in my business? &gt;&gt; The Platform  Short answer: Yes.Long answer: It&apos;s complicated. This depends a lot on the use case. We know that Office is a huge product with a collection of extremely rich features. Really, there isn&apos;t anything that Office can&apos;t do  especially when you look at complex operations available within Word and Excel in particular.

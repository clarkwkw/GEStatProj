    "text": "Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dawnguard, Xbox 360 Dawnguard is the first downloadable extension to Skyrim, the super-epic surprise bestseller of 2011. In it you&apos;ll either help slay Lord Harkon and his vampiric horde or join up and lead the blood-sucking onslaught, gaining powers that include the ability to turn into a cloud of bats and telekinetically choke enemies, Vader style. Life as a nine-foot vampire lord isn&apos;t all giggles, though: you won&apos;t fit through many doorways, can&apos;t loot treasure chests, and your blood boils in sunlight. Rather inconvenient, especially for higher-level characters, it&apos;s a trade-off that won&apos;t feel like a terribly good deal. Whichever faction you opt for, you can wield crossbows and shoot them from horseback at new monsters including death hounds, gargoyles and legendary dragons in this 10-ish hour jaunt. It&apos;s nice to meet more Skyrim inhabitants and beef up the skills of vampires and werewolves, but with only a few extra locations to discover, Dawnguard is fun, but hardly essential. Bethesda, 1,600 Micrsoft Points (approx 13.60) Spec Ops: The Line, PS3 &amp; Xbox 360     Spec Ops: The Line    You&apos;re Captain Walker, leading a three-man special forces team into the collapsing remnants of sandstorm-ravaged Dubai in search of the lost 33rd Battalion and its renegade commander. That means pinwheeling between chaotic sand-blown exteriors and shotgun-strewn interiors, using gun turrets and pointing out targets for your chaps in a scenario that almost redefines &quot;well-worn&quot;. It&apos;s lifted by its setting, though, which makes superb use of the crumbling opulence, juxtaposing abandoned supercars and vast tropical fish tanks with the usual head-stomping, corpse-charring brutality, and also by its retelling of Joseph Conrad&apos;s Heart Of Darkness, delivering countless opportunities for Apocalypse Now references. While happy to take pot shots at designated targets, your team mates aren&apos;t particularly lethal. The shock of shooting American soldiers never manages to feel especially unsettling, but it&apos;s an immersive few hours nonetheless. 2K Games, 39.99 Games news     Beat The Beat: Rhythm Paradise    Other games out this week include Nintendo&apos;s superbly inventive Beat The Beat: Rhythm Paradise (Wii), which mixes unhinged Wario Ware-esque mini-games with rhythm action; Tour De France 2012 (Xbox, PS3), which does its best to make a game out of the gruelling, drug-fuelled toil that is the world&apos;s best-known bike race; repetitious budget priced zombie-stabber, Dead Island: Game Of The Year Edition (Xbox, PS3, PC) for those who haven&apos;t yet had enough of fighting legions of undead with inexplicably delicate kitchen knives; and Jonah Lomu Rugby Challenge (Vita) brings egg-shaped happiness to Vita. Meanwhile Valve has released Source Filmmaker, the tool it used to create dozens of short films using the characters of Team Fortress 2. It&apos;s currently in closed beta but will soon be available to machinima fans everywhere.",

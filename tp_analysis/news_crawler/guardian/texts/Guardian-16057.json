    "text": "Two weeks ago, I had the idea of organising an alternative E3 event in London  just somewhere for gamers to congregate and lap up the atmosphere of the biggest week in gaming. I got together with developer Georg Backer and Jimmy Dance, owner of the Loading Bar in Soho, and we hatched a ludicrously ambitious plan. That plan has swung into action today.  At 10am, EToo London opened its doors to game players, indie developers and industry veterans. We&apos;ll be demo-ing new games all day  and indeed for the next four days from 10am every day  and if you find yourself in Central London, please do pop along: if it&apos;s quiet we&apos;ll let you in without a ticket.  But if you can&apos;t make it, don&apos;t worry. Tonight from 5pm, EToo be live streaming an E3 &apos;magazine show&apos;, running all the press conferences and providing expert analysis and opinion on what gets shown. You&apos;ll be able to access the live stream on this site, or via the EToo YouTube channel.  After this, EToo will be live streaming a full programme of E3 trailers, news and debate every night from 7pm.",

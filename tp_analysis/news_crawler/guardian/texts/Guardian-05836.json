    "text": "June&apos;s star celestial event is the transit of Venus across the Sun, the last one until 2117. The spectacle begins at about 23:10 BST on 5 June but is only visible from Britain for one hour or so from sunrise on the 6th. The planet, 58 arcsec in diameter, is visible as a sizeable black dot against the Sun&apos;s N hemisphere until it leaves the disc between 05:37 and 05:55 as seen from Britain. I had more details about this here on 14 May but, as I did then, I must warn that serious eye damage is likely if we use binoculars or a telescope to look directly at the Sun. Ophiuchus and Hercules sprawl across our S sky at the map times and the red supergiant Antares in Scorpius glowers low in the S. Mars, moving E from Leo to Virgo and dimming from mag 0.5 to 0.8, stands well to the left of Regulus in the SW at nightfall and is low in the W by our map times. Saturn dims from mag 0.5 to 0.7 as it hovers about 5 above Spica in Virgo. Find them in the S at nightfall at present, moving to the SW by our map times, and look for the Moon nearby on Thursday night. Emerging from the Sun&apos;s far side, Jupiter is bright at mag 2.0 and rises in the NE one hour before the Sun on the 12th and two hours before sunrise on the 29th. Hot from its transit and conspicuous at mag 4.1 to 4.4, Venus joins Jupiter in the predawn twilight and moves from 10 below-left of Jupiter on the 15th to 5 below Jupiter on the 30th. Mercury is a mere 5 or 6 high in the NW 40 minutes after sunset between the 10th and 29th, fading from mag 0.8 to 0.4. A partial eclipse of the Moon from 11:00 to 13:06 BST on the 4th is visible from areas around the Pacific, including the USA, but not at all from Europe.

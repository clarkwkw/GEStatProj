    "text": "Aside from the fascinating tale of Pebble and its imminently shipping &quot;smart watch&quot;.. Microsoft turned up (even though it&apos;s not exhibiting) and gave people the chance to play with its Surface Pro. But let&apos;s have the Pebble first:  The Pebble smartwatch keeps it simple (hands-on) &gt;&gt; The Verge  The Pebble is an attractive smartwatch in part because of its e-paper display. People commonly confuse e-paper with E Ink (in fact, we did just that in our video below), but it&apos;s mostly a distinction of brand rather than function. The screen doesn&apos;t seem to offer quite as much contrast or reflect as much light as E Ink displays, but it&apos;s miles better than the display on the Metawatch. It&apos;s black-and-white only, of course, with a resolution of 144 x 168 pixels. On the right-hand side are three buttons  up, down, and select  and on the left is a single back button. The buttons are pretty big and offer more resistance than you might at first expect, but presumably that&apos;s to prevent accidental presses. It charges via a small magnetic clip that snaps on the side. Pebble tells us the watch should last about a week on a single charge, which takes about two hours to complete. It&apos;s also water-resistant down to four atmospheres, which should be enough for your morning laps in the pool.  (I ordered one ages ago, so we&apos;ll aim to have a real in-use review once it arrives.) Now, the Surface Pro is here.  Microsoft Surface Pro hands-on: this is what it should have been all along &gt;&gt; Gizmodo Sam Biddle:   Surface RT was an enormous letdownnot because it was bad, but because it could have been so, so good. But Microsoft brought the Pro version to Vegas and let us playand I couldn&apos;t be happier.To be blunt, Surface Pro makes RT look like a mistake. Surface RT was a mistakebut fortunately for Microsoft (and more importantly, for us), Pro makes up for almost every deficiency of its smaller, cheaper sibling. It has the internal power and the physical flexibility to, for real this time, perhaps carve out a whole new category of computer. It could be the device you put in your bag and on your desk above all others. Almost every conceivable facet is superior this time around.  Hard to know how Microsoft will react to people saying, &quot;Oh, the Surface Pro is wonderful - so much better than that terrible Surface RT.&quot;  Gizmodo wasn&apos;t the only one to get a hands-on:  Surface Pro: an in-depth look at Microsoft&apos;s super tablet &gt;&gt; The Verge Tom Warren:   Similar to the Surface RT, Surface Pro takes advantage of a built-in kickstand and Touch Cover / Type Cover combo to provide a tablet / notebook hybrid of sorts. This time Microsoft has angled the device at 26 degrees instead of 22 degrees, but if you compared the RT and Pro side-by-side it&apos;s difficult to tell the difference at first glance. These devices are clearly family members, and Microsoft has made sure they match in ways that allow you to use the same cover on either tablet. Surface Pro has a gorgeous 10.6-inch ClearType Full HD Display that outputs a 1920 x 1080 resolution. I say it&apos;s gorgeous because this display is unprecedented on this type of device. Text reproduction and colors were spot on and viewing angles were great for tablet use. Aside from the resolution, Microsoft has packed in 10 points of multi-touch support and active pen input There&apos;s certainly a trade off with the Pro compared to the RT and that lies in a combination of hardware and software. The thickness allows Microsoft to pack in an Intel Core i5 processor which gives you access to a full version of Windows 8 Pro  that means you get all your normal desktop apps. The price is weight and battery life. It&apos;s not clear exactly how long the Surface Pro will last on average use, but I estimate it&apos;s around five hours.  No word on price. Even so, Surface or no, it seems like everyone is down on CES, whether they&apos;re there or not. CES has sadly become a complete waste of time &gt;&gt; BGR Brad Reed:   Las Vegas is a much better place to be in January than Boston, and I&apos;ve typically had fun covering CES in the past. I skipped it this year, however, and after taking a look at all the &quot;big&quot; announcements unveiled by major tech vendors at CES 2013, all I can say is, &quot;Thank God I&apos;m stuck freezing in Massachusetts.&quot; Let&apos;s put it like this: If the most exciting announcements at your electronics trade show are a Sony Xperia phone and a Samsung chalkboard, then you have failed horribly at convincing major tech vendors that you&apos;re a worthy launching pad for their best new products.  Which does seem to be a problem. It becomes big TVs again and again. Unless Microsoft releases the Surface every year. Except it&apos;s not an exhibitor. But looking at what is really on show: LG smart fridge pictures and hands-on &gt;&gt; Pocket-lint Ian Morris:   We&apos;ve always loved the water cooling system of these American-style fridges, and the ability to have water provided either cold, or freezing in chunks or ground up is a dream come true. The impressive air filtration is useful too, for keeping the food fresh. The fridge is able to monitor conditions dynamically, and make changes on-the-fly to keep your food as fresh as possible for as long as possible.  Price: just $3,500. Would madam like a Surface Pro to go with it? Hands on: Alcatel One Touch Idol review &gt;&gt; Tech Radar John McCann:   The Alcatel One Touch Idol is one of a trio of new smartphones from the French firm which are pushing towards the top end of the mobile market. A less powerful understudy to the One Touch Idol Ultra, the Idol slides in with a 4.7-inch IPS LCD display, 1GHz dual-core processor, 512MB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage, 8MP camera and Android Jelly Bean. This is all squeezed into a slender 7.9mm chassis and Alcatel is claiming the One Touch Idol is the lightest smartphone in the world in its category tipping the scales at 110g.  For comparison, the iPhone 5 weight is 137g. So Alcatel&apos;s made a big, light phone. Meanwhile Wired has been sort-of-liveblogging-Instagramming CES. Here&apos;s what it thought of Wednesday: Wired Gadget Lab  Google Glass in blue. These bad boys will be available in multiple colors. (Kinda looks like this would go well with a baby blue Surface.)

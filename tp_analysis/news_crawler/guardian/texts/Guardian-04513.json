The World Food Programme's response will focus particularly on children under two Photograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP       A woman from the village of Tounfini in Ouallam. Cash transfers will be used in areas that have been carefully selected according to how well local markets are functioning, food availability and prices. The operation includes food relief for Malian refugees and returning Nigerian workers fleeing insecurity in northern Mali Photograph: WFP/Rein Skullerud/Digital       A woman in the Mangaize refugee camp carries a sack of super cereal, a corn-based product infused with micronutrients that makes an important contribution to child health. About 11,300 metric tonnes of food assistance have been distributed to more than 1.1 million people since the WFP scaled up its work in Niger in NovemberPhotograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP       Paid work worth around $4.2m has provided support to people in the worst-affected areas of the country, while food-for-work activities have resulted in the distribution of about 11,000 tonnes of foodPhotograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP       In the last week of April alone, around  264,000 people in the Tahoua and Niamey regions were involved in food-for-work activities, while more than 100,000 people received cash for work. In April and May, the two initiatives were expanded to reach 1 million peoplePhotograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP       WFP executive director Ertharin Cousin visits the village of Tokolbey, where WFP is providing nutritional support for about 3,500 babies and their mothers. In total, 39,000 children are being assisted by the WFP in the Ouallam area, where malnutrition rates hover at the emergency level of 10-14% Photograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP       Supplies are provided at the blanket supplementary feeding site, Zabon Moucho, one of 150 nutrition feeding centres in the region Photograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP       Women pass rocks to the site of the dam they are building. The dam will enable them to store water and irrigate more crops next year Photograph: WFP/Rein Skullerud/Digital       A number of factors have particularly affected Maradi, all affecting food and fuel costs in southern areas of Niger. They include heavy crop losses due to pest infestations; rising food prices compounded by the often limited availability of cereals; the return of migrant workers following insecurity in Nigeria and reduced fuel subsidies in Nigeria Photograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP       As pasture and water for livestock are becoming increasingly limited, the livelihoods of pastoralists are of particular concern. Their situation is compounded by insecurity in Nigeria, which has disrupted the traditional movement of herders. Vulnerable households have started migrating in larger numbers and for longer periods, affecting childrens school attendance and the quality and quantity of food they consume Photograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP       Acute malnutrition was already prevalent in Marardi, but the situation has deteriorated as a result of the food security crisis since the end of 2011. Food aid and cash-for-work programmes in the area are helping to keep families in place and children in school, and assisting in the treatment of moderately malnourished children Photograph: Rein Skullerud/WFP  ",

    "text": "Age: 66 Appearance: Weary Ah yes, it&apos;s hard work being an all-conquering conglomerated behemoth. Hmm. Yes. Or an all-surrendering one. That&apos;s a perplexing remark. Can you explain it? I can. You see, Tokyo&apos;s world-famous Sony corporation, purveyor of Walkmen and PlayStations to all mankind, is going to the dogs. Which dogs? Oh, just metaphorical ones. But that&apos;s still bad. Sony&apos;s share price fell below Y1,000 for the first time since 1980, when it launched the Walkman. Ouch. The company is now worth less than 6% of what it was in 2000, when the PlayStation 2 had just come out. Further ouch. Yes, it has been a long procession of ouches every day at Sony City. That sounds like a Japanese workplace- bonding exercise. It does, yet in fact it&apos;s another metaphor, evoking the company&apos;s many setbacks. Sony was the world&apos;s leading television maker until 2006, when Samsung overtook it. The PlayStation has since been eclipsed by Nintendo&apos;s Wii. The whole corporation has lost money for the past three years... Oh dear. They must be sniggering into their sushi down at Panasonic. First, Japanese people don&apos;t just eat sushi. Second, Panasonic isn&apos;t sniggering into anything right now. On the same day, its own share price fell below Y500 for the first time in 37 years. That old rivalry has got rather maudlin recently. A bit of British spirit, that&apos;s what they need to get them through this! That&apos;s what they have had. British-born, anyway. Sir Howard Stringer, who is now American, has been chief executive since 2005, and he has done sterling work. Oh, sure. I bet everybody&apos;s thrilled. Well, they don&apos;t hate him, anyway. &quot;Were it not for the strong leadership of Sir Howard Stringer these past seven years, we would have been in a much more difficult position,&quot; says Kazuo Hirai. And he is? The new chief executive. Do say: &quot;I&apos;ve got it! Launch the iWalkman!&quot; Don&apos;t say: &quot;We&apos;ll always have Betamax.&quot;",

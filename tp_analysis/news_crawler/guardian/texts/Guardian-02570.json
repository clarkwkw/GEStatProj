The population of  these rhinos, also known as Nepalese rhinos, is on the increase, figures show. A recent census at the park recorded 93 of the animals, up from 84 in the last census in 2009. Another 100 have been counted in  the Rajiv Gandhi national park in Orang. The rising numbers are due to an intensive effort by authorities to guard the animals from poachers and to involve villagers living around the reserves Photograph: STR/EPA       A chimpanzee in an area of Kibale rainforest that is part of a project aiming to reforest more than 10,000 hectares of indigenous forest in Uganda Photograph: Kate Holt       Two blacknecked stilts at Cano Negro wildlife refuge, Costa Rica Photograph: Jeffrey Arguedas/EPA       A species of lizard native to the Hawaiian Islands, the copper striped blue-tailed skink (Emoia impar), is now officially extinct. The species was once common throughout the Hawaiian Islands and is still found on other island groups in the tropical Pacific. The last sighting was in the NaPali coast of Kauai in the 1960s. But repeated field surveys on Kauai, Oahu, Maui and Hawaii islands from 1988 to 2008 have yielded no sightings or specimens Photograph: Chris Brown/USGS       A great green macaw at a nursery of the ARA project in Alajuela, Costa Rica.

Four staff members at South Africa's flagship Kruger national park have been arrested on suspicion of killing rhinos and selling their horns to criminal syndicates, the park service said this week.  Home to more than 90% of the continent's rhinos, South Africa is on the frontline of a worsening war with poachers, who send the horns to China and south-east Asia for use in traditional medicine Photograph: Stringer/Reuters       A wet little owl sitting on a tree stump after getting caught in the rain,  West Sussex  Photograph: Dale Sutton/Rex Features       A herd of  deer in the Van Vihar national park in Bhopal, India Photograph: SANJEEV GUPTA/EPA       New research led by BirdLife International has found that half of the world's most important sites for nature are currently unprotected.

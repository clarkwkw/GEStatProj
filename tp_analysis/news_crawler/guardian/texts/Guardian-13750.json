    "text": "Teenagers with top A-level grades are likely to have more offers from prestigious universities this year, when limits on degree places are relaxed. Universities will be free from autumn to enroll as many students with ABB grades or higher at A-level as they wish. There could be more than 100,000 such students this year. In contrast, the number of places for students with lower grades is limited and there will be fewer options for these students this year. Last year, for the first time, universities were free to recruit as many AAB students as they could; this year restrictions on ABB students have been lifted. Statisticians at the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which distributes funds to universities on behalf of the government, predict 115,000 students will achieve these grades this year. Bahram Bekhradnia, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, said these students would be in high demand from universities, which in many cases offered generous scholarships to tempt the brightest. A further 5,000 places are being given to institutions that set tuition fees lower than the maximum 9,000. On Thursday Hefce will announce that it will give universities and colleges in England 4.47bn for teaching and research in 2013-14. Of this, 2.3bn is for teaching, compared with 3.2bn last year. The shortfall will be made up by tuition fee income.",

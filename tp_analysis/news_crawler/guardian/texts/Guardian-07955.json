    "text": "Fans of traditional 2D adventure games can rejoice  after a long wait, Revolution Software has finally announced the fifth title in its legendary Broken Sword series. Subtitled The Serpent&apos;s Curse, the game once again follows George Stobbart and Nico Collard on a conspiracy-laden quest through Paris and beyond. The York-based developer has decided to self-publish the title, after considerable success updating the first two Broken Sword titles for iOS devices. However, to fund the latter stages of the development process, the York-based studio has launched a Kickstarter appeal, and is looking to raise $400,000. A range of perks for investors starts at a digital copy of the game for $15 and ends at $10,000 with Broken Sword jackets, comics, lunch with the dev team and an invite to the wrap party. &quot;The process of game development has previously been remote from our fans,&quot; said Cecil. &quot;By self publishing, we now have a direct relationship with our audience  a position that we value enormously. We&apos;re delighted that the latest Broken Sword title is to be the first of our adventures that we can take with our fans. By pledging support now, we&apos;ll be going on a journey which will end when the opening credits roll  it&apos;s going to be excellent.&quot; As part of the Kickstarter project, Revolution has made a video outlining its appeal to investors. The amusing sequence shows Cecil directing his animated characters in a scene from the game, before appearing with them on the &apos;set&apos;. The game will be available on PC, Mac, iOS and Android in early 2013.",

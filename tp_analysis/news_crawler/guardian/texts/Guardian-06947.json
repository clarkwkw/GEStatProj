    "headline": "'Blind marking' urged to raise exam score of  pupils from ethnic minorities", 
    "text": "Ministers are seeking to introduce &quot;blind marking&quot; of pupils&apos; schoolwork by teachers as part of a push to tackle a history of underachievement among black and ethnic minority groups, while banks will be required to carry out ethnic monitoring of people to whom they lend money. Under the proposals, the identities of pupils would not be a factor when teachers mark work, and banks could be held accountable for the racial profile of their customers. The controversial plans are part of a package of policies being examined as part of the government&apos;s integration strategy, designed to reduce inequalities between races. The coalition has previously been accused of allowing a row between David Cameron and Nick Clegg, over whether multiculturalism has failed, to stymie its efforts to tackle the problem. The government&apos;s strategy, which was unveiled in February by the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, provides more money for English classes, for community music days and in support of youth groups such as the Scouts. It was savaged by 19 charities, who claimed that it did little to address racial inequalities. They highlighted a lack of concrete solutions to deal with problems revealed by statistics that show that almost half of young black people and 31% of young Asians are unemployed. Figures also reveal that while Chinese boys are among the highest-performing groups in schools, they can expect to earn 25% less than white graduates. It is understood that the Liberal Democrat communities minister, Andrew Stunell, with support from Clegg, wants to introduce a series of radical policies in the coming months, despite the opposition of some of their government partners. A senior Whitehall source said: &quot;We waited a long time to get the integration strategy out the door, but we&apos;re now keen to get on with the job of implementing it. A lot of the projects supported by the integration strategy have slipped by under most people&apos;s radars, but Andrew is keen that we turn up the volume and speak out much more often and much louder on race issues.&quot; As a first step, Liberal Democrat ministers will give prominent support to two reports set to be published this summer. Last November, speaking at the Scarman memorial lecture, Clegg announced that Stunell would lead a government inquiry into the barriers preventing black and ethnic minority groups from accessing loans and other financial services. While an increase in ethnic monitoring by banks is likely to face a backlash from groups concerned about privacy, it is now seen as a crucial step. Recent evidence from the Black Training and Enterprise Group suggests black Caribbean and African people are much more likely to consider starting a business, yet only 6% are self-employed or own their own business, compared with 15% of white people. Stunell is set to endorse proposals in a report to be published soon by Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Meral Hussein-Ece on race, including the introduction of anonymous marking across all student assessments. A study by Ofsted in 1999 showed that students with a typically African or Asian-sounding name were likely to be given up to 12% lower marks in institutions where anonymous marking was not in place. However, Leeds University found that after changing its system to introduce anonymous marking, the scores of black minority ethnic students and women rose by up to 12%. A source said the Lib Dems believed that similar changes to other assessment procedures would ensure that everyone was marked fairly. A spokesperson added: &quot;Some, including [education secretary] Michael Gove, believe policy should be colour-blind. But that is not the reality of what is happening in schools.&quot; Hussein-Ece&apos;s report will also focus on apprenticeships and call for the introduction of ethnic monitoring in this area too, particularly in relation to application success rates, and a focus on increasing the numbers of under-represented groups on apprenticeship schemes. Only 7% of apprenticeships in England in 2009-10 were undertaken by a person from a BME background, even though 14% of the working-age population comes from an ethnic minority background. The most recent figures on completed apprenticeships show no significant improvement, with only 8% of 16- to 24-year-olds who completed an apprenticeship between August 2011 and January 2012 coming from a BME background, even though BME groups account for 16% of this age group. A source indicated that Hussein-Ece&apos;s report will also include a rebuke of the Tories. The report is expected to say: &quot;Liberal Democrats do not believe that &apos;multiculturalism is dead&apos;, as some in the media and other political parties would have us believe. While it is important to unite around the many things we have in common, it remains important to celebrate our different cultures and embrace diversity, not smother it.&quot;",

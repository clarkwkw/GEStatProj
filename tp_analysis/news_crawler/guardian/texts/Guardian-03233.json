    "text": "      Today&apos;s video is a good beginning for a Monday morning in spring. It tells you a little about Fibonacci numbers in nature, a subject that Alan Turing was studying before he died. This video also tells you about an interesting &quot;citizen science project&quot; being held by the upcoming Manchester Science Festival that you can participate in: growing sunflowers!   What do sunflowers and Alan Turing share in common? Basically, Turing noticed that the number of spirals in the seed patterns of sunflower heads often conform to a number that appears in the mathematical sequence called the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89). Other plants also show this pattern. When Turing came to the University of Manchester, he began exploring how this phenomenon might help us to understand the growth of plants, a field now known as phyllotaxis.  Tragically, Turing died before his work was complete, so the Manchester Science Festival is asking for you to help mathematicians explore Turing&apos;s ideas about plant growth. To do this, they need data, lots of data. You can help the Manchester Science Festival by sowing sunflower seeds in April and May, nurturing the plants throughout the summer and when the sunflowers are fully grown, they&apos;ll ask you to count the number of seed spiral patterns in the sunflower heads.  This video tells us a little more about Fibonacci numbers in nature:            [video link].  Have you ever grown sunflowers? If not, here&apos;s an easy how-to video guide for how to get started:             [video link].  Even though the Manchester Science Festival wants you to grow big sunflowers, I thought you&apos;d be inspired after watching this really sweet time-lapse video of dwarf sunflowers growing indoors:             [video link].  Did you see that little ladybird at 1:39? Adorable! Are you ready to get started?

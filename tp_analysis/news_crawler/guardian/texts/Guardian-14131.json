    "text": "I agree with many of George Monbiot&apos;s arguments about the concentration of wealth and particularly property in the hands of a small self-perpetuating elite (Comment, 26 March). However, I don&apos;t think farm subsidies fall into the same category. The main effect of the common agricultural policy is to allow markets, in particular the supermarket cartels, to pay less for farmers&apos; output. It is in effect a 3.6bn subsidy to retailers and shoppers. The most recent figures for Scotland, where I farm, suggest that less than 36% of farms would be profitable without subsidy. When New Zealand removed all farm subsidies many inefficient farms went under but the survivors became more profitable. Lastly Mr Monbiot seems to suggest that the CAP subsidies could have bought all the UK&apos;s farmland. Possibly, but land nationalisation in other parts of the world has invariably led to a huge drop in output and a worse deal for the consumer.Luke GaskellMelrose, Roxburghshire",

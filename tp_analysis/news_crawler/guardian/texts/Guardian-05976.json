As the date approaches I am more and more sceptical, as the leaders of the whole world are not giving hope through their messages. On the risks issues, climate change will be the most [discussed] topic. This climatic phenomenon is known and the solutions are not beyond the capacity of human beings. It is matter of political will. In fact, the first risk that developing countries face  [and have done] for so long  is poverty. This risk needs to be reduced so that Africans can live as men, with rights and dignity, and tackle their development. It seems that this meeting is not going to help these countries to come out of their debt situation; it will encourage them to borrow more than before. Climate change is a threat that is going to impact Africa negatively  and probably for a long time  if nothing is done to reduce its effects. For the coming years, developing countries risk increasing their debt toward Breton Wood institutions. This is a real risk, [one to which] Rio+20&apos;s meeting should pay attention. Are the developing countries going to borrow money to fight against climate change? Are those historically responsible going to continue as if there is nothing to change?",

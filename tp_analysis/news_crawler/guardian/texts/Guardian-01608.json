    "text": "The Cat that Got The Milk is a PC and Mac game with a bit of a difference. It looks strange, it sounds strange and it involves controlling a cat through a variety of of obstacle-strewn environments, designed to represent a feline understanding of the world. It also has just two controls, up and down. But that&apos;s not the key bit. The key bit is that it&apos;s meant to be completed in just 15 minutes.  &quot;In the modern age there is so much entertainment vying for the attention of the tuned in gamer,&quot; says co-designer Oliver Clarke, who had worked in the industry for several years before starting out on this venture with three other developers. &quot;We believe it&apos;s a privilege to be a part of a player&apos;s time therefore we should respect it. 15 minutes is the right length of time to provide an exciting, compelling experience that you can enjoy without having to worry about investing that time in a game.&quot; The simple mechanic grew out of discussions about the one-button games that have flourished in the smartphone sector. From here, the feline element sort of sauntered in. &quot;The theme came from a pet cat I grew up with,&quot; says Clarke. &quot;And there&apos;s a Jack Nicholson quote, &apos;If you&apos;re on stage, a cat walks on and everyone is still looking at you...you&apos;re a star,&apos;&quot;            The other striking part of the game is the art-style, which seems to zip between Mondrian, Miro and Wassily Kandinsky in the blink of a cat&apos;s eye. &quot;The visual look was inspired by many visits to London Galleries,&quot; says Clarke. &quot;We looked at artists ranging from Mark Rothko to Kandinsky. In this country, we&apos;re so lucky to have an incredible variety of art available to us to see, for free! I believe if we can take an understanding of just 1% of what&apos;s in our galleries we can make some visually amazing games. It&apos;s been great to receive feedback from players who are really getting a kick out of seeing art they recognise in a game in ways they&apos;ve never seen before.&quot; The title is currently available for download on PC and Mac, and the team has already started working on a follow-up, The Button. It&apos;s another 15-minute experience, although the four-person studio is looking to build up as they become more experienced. &quot;Right now, we feel that we should earn a players time,&quot; says Clarke. &quot;We&apos;re going to continue learning how to create quality, short, entertaining games. With The Cat that Got the Milk we&apos;re making our first brave steps, we&apos;re taking on board all the feedback, all the criticisms, and learning, learning, learning.&quot;",

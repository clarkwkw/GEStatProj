    "text": "PC gamers missing the visceral thrills of Far Cry 3 will be overjoyed at the patch currently available for download, which adds an extra-hard difficulty level and lets you reset the game&apos;s enemy outposts. Although not part of the plot, the process of observing then quietly stalking each encampment was the highlight of the game, and their repopulation supplies a totally free extra few hours&apos; jovial jungle gunnery. Also on current release is Chain Story (iPhone, iPad), which is a digital re-imagining of the party game where you write part of a story then fold the paper over and pass it on, before reading back the accidental lunacy you&apos;ve mutually created. Despite the odd non sequitur and a slight leaning towards American high school scenarios, it&apos;s a hugely addictive process and one that throws up way more than its fair share of silliness and hilarity.",

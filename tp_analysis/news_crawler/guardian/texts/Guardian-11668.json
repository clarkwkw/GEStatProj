    "text": "It is an increasingly familiar complaint  online gaming forums have become snakepits of defamation and derision. But you rarely hear it from the developers themselves, and certainly not about their own lovingly tended communities.  Earlier this month however, David Gaider, the lead writer on Bioware&apos;s Dragon Age series wrote a rather depressing post on his personal blog, claiming that he no longer visits the Bioware Social Network forums because of the &quot;toxic&quot; levels of abuse and vilification. &quot;Spending too much time there starts to make me feel negative,&quot; he writes. &quot;Not just about the games we make, but about myself and life in general. That&apos;s not a good feeling to have.&quot; He&apos;s keen to point out that it&apos;s not about slamming his head in the sand, ignoring constructive criticism, and he concedes that there is still useful feedback both good and bad. His problem is that the positivity is being completely drowned out.  &quot;The signal-to-noise ratio does seem to be worsening, and eventually you get the feeling like you&apos;re at one of those parties where all anyone is doing is bitching. It doesn&apos;t matter what they&apos;re bitching about so much as, sooner or later, that&apos;s all you can really hear. Engaging starts to mean partaking in the bitching until you feel like that&apos;s all you&apos;re doing. Even when I try to rise above, those who are most negative will seek me out in order to get a rise out of me and not unsuccessfully. I am only human, and I&apos;ll end up responding to score points just as they do, and end up feeling shitty for having done so.   He also makes an interesting point on how online communities can devolve:  &quot;Eventually the polite, reasonable folks stop feeling like it&apos;s a group of people they want to hang around. So they leave, and those who remain start to see only those who agree with them and, because that&apos;s all they see, they think that&apos;s all there is. Everyone feels as they do, according to them. Once the tipping point is passed, you&apos;re left with the extremes those who hate, and those who dislike the haters enough to endure the toxic atmosphere to try and combat them. Each clash between those groups drives more of the others away.&quot;  Of course the negativity that can arise from online anonymity is an issue that goes much further than gaming; media sites the world over are grappling with the puzzle of encouraging reader interaction while also ensuring people behave in a respectful manner. From Tripadvisor reviews to Facebook posts and, yes, newspaper comments sections, the process of contributing has to be made intuitive and uninvasive, but yet these factors also provide a shield from behind which participants feel comfortable to sling bile.  And it definitely seems as though the distancing effect of the anonymous online forum is part of the problem here. Gaider compares the experience of reading these pages with attending the company&apos;s fan conventions. Again, he anticipates the criticism that he&apos;s just looking for sycophantic fanboys  and counters: &quot;It&apos;s possible to like something overall and yet dislike parts of it intensely, or to be disappointed overall in something you were hoping to like, and in either case to have a positive discussion regarding what you&apos;ve disliked. I&apos;ve had several such discussions with fans at cons, and indeed walked away from those discussions with a far better attitude about them simply because the tone of that interaction was not adversarial.&quot;  Certainly, you&apos;re always going to get a different demographic of gamer at cons: the time, effort and expense of attending a physical event means that many of the more misanthropic elements of the community will be removed. But it&apos;s also much more difficult to actually spit death threats into the face of a developer than it is to post them online with very little fear of recourse. Much has been made this year about the supposed entitlement of gamers. Bioware knows more about it than many others, thanks to the internet protests that kicked off after the disappointing ending of Mass Effect 3. There has been plenty of thoughtful and intelligent criticism from gamers online  indeed in the comments section of this very Games Blog  but there has also been absurd inappropriate fury.  And as his blog post has been picked up by sites like Kotaku and Eurogamer, Gaider must be steeling himself for more abuse. News sites can only quote sections of his argument, and context can become part of a complex equation of misrepresentation and mythologising:  &quot;It&apos;s especially hard when someone takes something you&apos;ve said and twists it, and then misrepresents it to others as what you actually said.. and how would they know otherwise? Reference that misrepresentation and, as far as anyone&apos;s concerned, I may as well have said it. The urge to go in and correct them is almost overwhelming. But what would be the point, other than to offer them new ammunition and ultimately end up being an asshole myself?&quot;  Requiring forum members to post under their real names has never been a popular solution. One alternative to that comes from the murky underworld of gamification: perhaps encouraging polite, mature posts by providing rewards and premium benefits to worthy participants may be a way of changing behaviours  a &apos;carrot&apos; approach to contrast the usual &apos;stick&apos; of banning.  Whatever, when a developer feels irrevocably alienated from his own community, you feel that something probably needs to change. In this age of endless franchises and DLC, building an &apos;engaged userbase&apos; is vital, but if that turns toxic, nothing good will come of it; least of all a better game.",

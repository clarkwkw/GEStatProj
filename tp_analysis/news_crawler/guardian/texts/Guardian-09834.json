    "text": "Hurricane Sandy has forced Google to postpone an event on Monday morning in New York where it planned to show off its partners&apos; newest &quot;Nexus&quot; smartphones  though enough detail has already leaked out ahead of time to describe the phones and tablets it was expected to show off. Following a number of leaks online, UK retailer Carphone Warehouse last week was spotted by Pocket Lint showing a page with full details about a phone made by struggling handset maker LG that is expected to be the next &quot;Nexus 4&quot;: it has a 4.7in display, 1280x768 screen resolution (giving it a pixel density of 320ppi), have an 8MP rear camera, panoramic photo capture system and NFC. It is also expected to have a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, LTE connectivity in the US, and 8GB of onboard storage. As is standard with Google&apos;s &quot;Nexus&quot; models, there is no SD card option for expanding the onboard storage. It is expected to run Android 4.2  though it&apos;s unclear whether that constitutes a full or minor upgrade to Android compared with its 4.1.2 version.  One report at The Next Web says that Android 4.2 will introduce a &quot;sharing&quot; option so that multiple users can swap logins on a single tablet  an option that would be especially attractive to families and businesses. Carphone Warehouse was taking pre-orders on Nexus 4 phone contracts beginning at 31 per month with no upfront cost. The site page where it showed them was unavailable on Monday morning. LG has been making losses in the handset business for about two years, and the unveiling was to be its first time making Google&apos;s &quot;reference&quot; Nexus model. Previous Nexus models have been made by HTC and Samsung. While the products have not in the past been big sellers  because they do not get widespread carrier support  for owners they usually provide a faster track to Android updates than other handsets. In an embarrassing twist for Google, one of its staff left the LG &quot;Nexus 4&quot; phone in a bar near its Silicon Valley offices in September - the same problem Apple faced in 2010 when one of its staff, Gray Powell, left an iPhone 4 prototype in a bar in nearby Redwood City. That phone was sold on for thousands of dollars, and led to police searches of a journalist&apos;s home following an article on Gizmodo. According to Wired, Google was no more peaceful about the loss of its phone: a friend of Jamin Barton, the bartender who found the device, described the Google staffer to Wired as &quot;little but really pushy, like military . He said he wanted to keep me out of trouble  like I was in any kind of trouble  keep the bar out of trouble. They could file criminal charges, he said.&quot; Google&apos;s staffer eventually recovered the phone, offering Barton a free model if he would keep quiet about it until after the launch. The search giant was also expected to show off one and possibly two tablets on Monday before being forced to postpone the event in New York. A version of its Nexus 7 tablet  possibly with 3G connectivity, and almost certainly with 32GB of storage rather than the current 16GB limit  and a &quot;Nexus 10&quot; tablet built by Samsung were both anticipated. According to leaked details from Argos reported by The Next Web, the 32GB Wi-Fi version will cost 199.99 and be available some time in November.  The Samsung tablet is expected to offer 2560x1600 pixels for 300ppi resolution in a 10in tablet, ahead of the just-announced new Apple iPad&apos;s 264ppi. Vic Gundotra, head of Google&apos;s mobile side, has posted a number of pictures on his Google+ profile whose EXIF data indicates that they were taken with a &quot;Nexus 10&quot; device.",

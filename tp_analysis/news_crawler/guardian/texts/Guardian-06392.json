    "text": "What is your app called and what does it do? It&apos;s called the Red Bull Racing Spy app and it tells Formula One fans about what&apos;s going on behind the scenes in the world&apos;s premier motorsport series. What devices is it on, and what are your plans? Currently it&apos;s on iPads and iPhones but fear not Android fans, we have plans to bring you your own version very shortly. What&apos;s the business model and why have you chosen it? It&apos;s pretty much a combination of James Hunt meets Loose Women. Fast living and highly educated opinion meets glamour and fast cars.  What&apos;s innovative about the app  what sets it apart? We have the usual F1 fare: lap times, results, championship standings, calendar but also a whole load of gossip and insider information about people who have run away with the circus we like to call &apos;The F1 Paddock&apos;. What&apos;s the competition  who else is out there in this area? There are lots of apps including the official Formula 1 timing app which tell the tale of what happens on the track, we like to think we&apos;re the only one which goes to races but doesn&apos;t actually concentrate on the racing. What are your future plans for the app? The Android version is a bit of a priority as is uncovering salacious gossip. I&apos;m joking. Just giving the fans the best insight we can. Tell us more about the company behind it It&apos;s a collaboration between Red Bull UK and the current Formula One world champions Red Bull Racing. It was made by Holler and our friends at the Red Bull Media House also lent a hand. But basically it was the Spy&apos;s doing. Who is he? It&apos;s a secret, but he&apos;s also on Twitter (@redbullf1spy).",

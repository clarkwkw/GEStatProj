    "text": "I had never seen rain this way before. I&apos;d considered it a nuisance, forcing me indoors or making me wear waterproofs, but now, it was my enemy. It had soaked through the cardboard that I slept on  my only protection against cold stone and wet grass  and had drenched my clothes and sleeping bag. I tried to dry myself with a damp towel then, realising the futility, gave up. I slung my backpack over my shoulder and ventured out from my sleeping spot  a poorly sheltered but hidden park  after less than half an hour&apos;s sleep. And I still had two more nights of this: sleeping rough to raise awareness of homelessness for the campaigning group Team V.  According to Shelter 75,000 young people are homeless. They are on the streets, sofa-surfing, or in sheltered accommodation. I am in that number. Since I was 16, after a brief spell with a mate&apos;s family, I&apos;ve lived independently in supported housing. I&apos;m 19 now, reading politics at Keele University. And so I&apos;ve been wondering  am I some kind of exception? A study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has shown &quot;a strong association between homelessness and withdrawal from education&quot;. But does this need to be the case? Can the young homeless not remain in education? Before anything can be achieved, people&apos;s preconceptions about homelessness need to change. Homelessness does not necessarily entail living on the streets. In fact a comparatively low number of young people, on any given night, sleep rough. Many live in temporary accommodation, stay in hostels, or simply travel between sofas: all are forms of homelessness. There is also a misconception that people make themselves homeless through substance abuse or addiction. While this is not uncommon, the main reason, especially for young people, is relationship breakdown. Homelessness must also be pushed up the government&apos;s agenda. It should continue to invest in suitable accommodation. By creating more hostels, suitable houses, and supported housing, it can provide a more stable environment for young people. For me, this was crucial. But outside of accommodation, the most pressing issue for young people is their finances. I lived off benefits during sixth form; receiving 50 each week. This money had to pay for gas, electricity, rent, food, clothing, school equipment, travel and more. It was simply not enough. My education maintenance grant saved me, providing an extra 30. The EMA has now been cut. It needs reinstating, and the benefits system needs to be fairer to younger people. Under-25s do not get the full amount of income support, and under-21s get less money from part-time work. To help keep young people in education this ageist system needs an overhaul.  Universities need to offer more scholarships and bursaries for homeless students and realise the complexities of homelessness. These bursaries must be flexible, to stop students with unusual backgrounds falling between the cracks. Universities must also support homeless students during the holidays  they may be unable to find anywhere to stay. With the right support, there&apos;s no reason young homeless people cannot remain in education. Sleeping rough with Team V did not get any easier. A cold freeze (I woke up covered in frost) made the third night nearly unbearable. By the fourth and final day, I was battling exhaustion, cold, food deprivation, isolation and exposure to the elements. Still, I cannot complain. I&apos;m one of the lucky homeless. I reached university. Phil Bennion, MEP for the West Midlands, says: &quot;Unfortunately, a growing proportion of homeless people are young people who have so much to offer society.&quot; Both the government and the education sector need to put more effort into supporting the young and homeless. They  we  deserve a chance.",

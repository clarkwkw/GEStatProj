    "text": "A cunning combination of word search, Tetris and those kids&apos; puzzles with the slidey tiles, Word Soup is simple enough to grasp on a short commute, but suitably addictive to last a long-haul flight. After a genuinely helpful tutorial, you&apos;re confronted with 108 colourful letter tiles, the object of the exercise being to look for words formed in any direction along adjoining squares. Selecting a valid word causes it to disappear from the grid, with letters from immediately above dropping down to replace it, while tilting your device allows you to shunt stray tiles over to the other side of the screen. Then  when things get really tricky and you&apos;re left with more consonants than Roman Abramovich&apos;s Rolodesk  two lifelines are on offer: one allows you to re-sort the grid; the other suggests a word (&quot;Vav&quot;? Really?). The aim is to clear the screen for a 500-point bonus, with longer words (&quot;Banter&quot;, get in!) winning chirpy &quot;well done&quot; messages, and getting rounded up in a comprehensive, shareable high scores sequence. Game play is against the clock, or in &quot;relaxed&quot; and &quot;longer words&quot; modes, each offering the same laughably fleeting sense of achievement at mining tiny words from confined seams of letters. Word Soup seemingly started life as a coin-op, installed in more than 30,0000 UK pubs. With only its all-round approachability and that tilt facility to distinguish it from the free likes of Letris, this app incarnation is unlikely to have quite the same impact but  like that questionable three-letter word  I&apos;ll &quot;vav&quot; it anyway.

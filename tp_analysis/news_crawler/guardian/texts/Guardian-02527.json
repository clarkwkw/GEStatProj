    "text": "The results of the RSPB&apos;s annual Big Garden Birdwatch survey are in. This Thursday we&apos;re joined at 1pm for an hour by the wildlife expert Richard James to answer your questions on what the figures can tell us about the state of British garden bird life.  The survey, which involved 600,000 people this year, revealed an all-time low for the number of starlings seen squabbling in gardens, which has fallen by almost four-fifths since 1979. After a mild winter, more blackbirds, blue tits and long-tailed tits stayed in the countryside, while there were some increases in the number of garden visitors, with goldfinches still on the rise. The Birdwatch is the UK&apos;s biggest public wildlife survey. Each year participants are encouraged to download a recording sheet and then take one hour on 28 or 29 January to note the species they spot.  James will be on hand to answer your bird questions. Want to know more about what might have caused the dramatic drop in starling numbers? Could the declines reflect the availability of food, or is it because of environmental changes in the UK and elsewhere in Europe? Or something else entirely? Perhaps you&apos;d like to know how we can tempt blackbirds back to our gardens from the countryside. Whatever your question about birds, birdwatching or the Big Garden Birdwatch, just post it below. Please note anything off-topic will be removed.",

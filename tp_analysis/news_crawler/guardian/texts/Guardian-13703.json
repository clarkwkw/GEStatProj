    "text": "My copy of Metro this morning tells me that &quot;in the dim and distant past, Britain led the world in science and engineering. We invented the reflecting telescope, the steam engine, the glider&quot; etc. etc. Well done us.  The piece refers to a survey, closing at the end of the week, launched by a consortium of science organisations. The aim is to find the top British innovation in order, I imagine, to generate some more news pieces trumpeting our scientific prowess. Leaving aside the pernicious techno-nationalism of this exercise (the UK also typically claims Nobel prizes both for emigrants born here and immigrants from elsewhere), let&apos;s think about whether this captures what &quot;innovation&quot; is.  My copy of Chris Freeman&apos;s Economics of Industrial Innovation, which I usually hide behind my Metro, tells me that &quot;innovation is used to describe the introduction and spread of new and improved products and processes in the economy&quot;. There are many other definitions in circulation. But, for now, the important points are that innovation is not just about things, it&apos;s not just about scientific discoveries, and it&apos;s not about inventions that never leave the workbench.  The survey&apos;s longlist contains some inventions that have now retreated from our lives, either because they have been superseded or because their technological ambitions have been exposed as pointless (Concorde, the Hovercraft). It contains plenty of inventions that have had widespread impact and some, such as the supersonic car and the clockwork radio, that get a lot of attention but aren&apos;t exactly in mass usage. The list also contains rather a lot of scientific discoveries and predictions (pulsars, relativity, the proof of Fermat&apos;s last theorem and many more) that patently (bad innovation pun intended) don&apos;t count.  So let&apos;s diversify the list. Here are my suggestions: the NHS, the Open University, the X Factor, Parliament (the institution, not the band), Moshi Monsters, Britpop, the Hobbit, the Premier League, Kate Middleton  Over to you.",

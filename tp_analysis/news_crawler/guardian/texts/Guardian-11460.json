    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Borrowing some of its mechanics from 90s classic The Lost Vikings, this game has you control a knight, a wizard and a thief, whose complementary skill sets let you solve the game&apos;s crafty puzzles. The knight likes chopping up monsters, the wizard conjures useful materials and uses levitation, while the thief&apos;s bow and arrow make her useful for dislodging hard-to-reach antagonists. Trine 2&apos;s most memorable feature is its scenery, the beautifully animated fantasy landscapes remaining jawdropping throughout. Yet the fact that gravity and Heath Robinson-style mechanisms underpin most puzzles means you can sometimes just muddle your way through by sheer persistence, and numerous unintended consequences, like enemies falling off ledges or getting ground up in machines, arise as a result.",

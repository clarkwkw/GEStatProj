    "text": "Every year, colleges roll out notable public figures from academia, pop culture, government, and more to deliver addresses at their graduation ceremonies. But these words of inspiration  and occasionally humor arent just for members of the 2013 graduating class. Thanks to the internet, we can all learn from the wisdom and experience of public notables such as President Barack Obama, Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly, author Jonathan Safran Foer and even Dr Dre. Weve selected the best speeches from the last week and provided the highlights below. Here&apos;s a link to view commencement speeches from earlier this month. Oprah Winfrey, Harvard, 30 May 2013: &apos;There is no such thing as failure&apos;            Oprah took the stage with a joyous IM AT HAAARVAAARD, just like you knew she would. Her commencement address touched on her own personal experiences and struggles, and simultaneously praised and poked fun at Harvard graduates. Say what? I wanted to...have you look under your seats and there would be free masters and doctorate degrees. Quotes: Snarky headlines from USA Today, Greek mythology Theme: You dont have to come from a place of privilege in order to accomplish great things, you just have to be driven, persistent, and willing to learn from every mistake (though it helps if you went to Harvard). Humor: 4/5 Advice: You will find true success and happiness if you have only one goal. There really is only one, and that is this: to fulfill the highest, most truthful expression of yourself as a human being. Best line:   There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction  Barack Obama, United States Naval Academy, 24 May 2013: &apos;We need you to uphold the highest standards of integrity and character&apos;       The president used the opportunity to tout Americas military strength, and his own record as Commander-in-Chief. He also addressed the issue of sexual assault in the armed forces, and charged the 2013 graduates with the responsibility of representing the military at its best. Say what? And so, in keeping with tradition, I declare all midshipmen on restriction for minor conduct offenses are hereby absolved. Theme: Maintaining Americas military strength and reputation, acting with integrity both in the public and private realm. Humor: 3/5. Applause: Often. After all, the speech was written with a heavy focus on the military. Advice: Never forget that honor, like character, is what you do when nobody is looking. Best line:  But even more than physical courage, we need your moral courage  the strength to do whats right, especially when its unpopular. Because at the end of the day and at the end of your career, you want to look in the mirror and say with confidence and with pride, I fulfilled my oath; I did my duty; I stayed true to my values  Joss Whedon, Wesleyan University, 26 May 2013: &apos;&quot;Two roads diverged in a wood and&quot; ... No. Im not that lazy&apos;       The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dr Horrible, and other cult hits returned to his alma mater to inspire the class of 2013 with his signature wit and honesty. Say what? You are all going to DIE. Quotes: Bill Cosby Theme: Despite his opening, Whedon spoke about accepting contradictions in ones self and yes, being comfortable taking the road less traveled. Humor: Its Joss Whedon, what do you think? Advice: Peace comes from the acceptance of the part of you that can never be at peace. It will always be in conflict. If you accept that, everything gets a lot better. Best line:  To accept duality is to earn identity  Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Kelly, Bard College, 25 May 2013: &apos;Starting tomorrow you can change the world&apos;       Giffords and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, shared the commencement speech, since Giffords injuries continue to make it difficult for her to speak. Someday soon, Gabby will be giving these speeches in their entirety, Kelly said. I think Im just getting a t-shirt. Say what? Make some apps that my daughter is going to have to explain to me someday.  Kelly Applause: Profuse, and when Giffords took the stage she received an extended standing ovation. Theme: The power of perseverance. Humor: Kelly gets a 3/5, and his humor tended toward dorky and self-deprecating. Giffords was upbeat but also more serious. Advice: Kelly: How good you are at the beginning of anything you try is not a good indicator of how good you can become. Best line:  The nation&apos;s counting on you to create, to lead, to innovate  but today we are celebrating you. Be bold, be courageous, be your best  Jon Lovett, Pitzer College, 18 May 2013, &apos;One of the greatest threats we face is, simply put, bullshit&apos;       Lovett, former speechwriter for Barack Obama and ace Arianna Huffington impersonator, crafted many of the Presidents jokes and created the NBC comedy 1600 Penn. Its no surprise that his speech was one of the funniest of the season, but what really stood out was his bluntness and optimism. Say what? I think we look amazing in these gowns. We look like gay federal judges. Quotes: F Scott Fitzgerald once said, Yeah, this should definitely be in 3D. Theme: The dire need for personal authenticity; how to balance youth and energy with inexperience, and then turn that inexperience into experience. Or put more simply: how to survive your 20s. Humor: 5/5. Advice: There are moments when you&apos;ll have a different point of view because you&apos;re a fresh set of eyes; because you don&apos;t care how it&apos;s been done before; because you&apos;re sharp and creative; because there is another way, a better way. But there will also be moments when you have a different point of view because you&apos;re wrong, because you&apos;re 23 and you should shut up and listen to somebody who&apos;s been around the block. Best line:  From my point of view, I&apos;d rather be wrong and cringe than right and regret not speaking up  (h/t: The Atlantic) Jonathan Safran Foer, Middlebury College, 26 May 2013: &apos;All that ever happened will be at your fingertips&apos;       Foer, author of Everything is Illuminated and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, delivered an insightful look at how technology simultaneously brings us together and alienates us from each other. It was very well written. Say what? On his own college commencement speech: Among many things I am unable to remember about the speaker on that spring morning: name, gender, age, race, physical build and voice. Theme: How technology is changing our modes of experience. Humor: 3/5. He started off the top by poking fun of Middleburys president. He also took a dig at Google Glass. But then he got serious, in that distinguished-young-writer kind of way. Advice: Everyone is always in need of something that another person can give, be it undivided attention, a kind word, or deep empathy. Theres no better use of ones life than to respond to ones needs. Best line:  I worry that the closer the world gets to our fingertips, the further it gets from our hearts  Dr Dre, University of Southern California, 18 May 2013: Yeah yeah, make some noise!&apos;       Dre and USC commencement speaker Jimmy Iovine donated $70m to the school to found the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. While Iovine handled the more formal role of imparting wisdom and inspiration to the graduates, Dr Dre couldnt help but add a quick, congratulatory footnote to the ceremony. Best line: Its a minute long, just watch it. (h/t: Vibe)",

    "text": "Everybody talks about the internationalisation of higher education and we see it everywhere on the agenda. The global competition for talents, the emergence of international branch campuses, the debate on use of agents for recruitment of students, the internationalisation of the curriculum, all this is widely debated on all levels and around the world. We see not only European, Northern American and Pacific universities embrace the international agenda, but also emerging economies in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East have become pro-active in stimulating the internationalisation of their education. The boundaries between resource countries and target countries of internationalisation have started to become blurred. The positive conclusion one could draw from this picture is that internationalisation is on the rise in higher education. But there are also concerns. In our essay with the deliberately provocative title &apos;The End of Internationalisation&apos; (International Higher Education, CIHE Boston College, number 62, winter 2011), we stated that there appears to be a trend to move from substance to form, and that the popularity of this might lead to a devaluation of what internationalisation means and implies. Looking at recently published articles, one could get the impression that internationalisation has an identity or mid-life crisis, as Jane Knight wonders in IMHE Info (OECD/IMHE, August 2011). What in our view certainly does not help the discussion is to focus on relabeling. A recent phenomenon in the debate on the future of internationalisation of higher education appears to be the inclination to put new broad labels on the term, such as mainstreaming, comprehensive, holistic, integrated and deep internationalisation. The most common current label appears to be &apos;comprehensive internationalisation&apos;, in particular thanks to the paper with that title of past NAFSA-president John Hudzik and with the subtitle &apos;From Concept to Action&apos;. We have little against action plans to enhance the notion of internationalisation, but if one compares Hudzik&apos;s &apos;definition&apos; of comprehensive internationalisation with the generally accepted definition by Jane Knight on internationalisation of higher education: &quot;the process of integrating an international, intercultural or global dimension into the purpose, functions or delivery of post-secondary education&quot; which finds its foundation already in the early 1990s, one cannot see much difference. And that applies to other labels as well. We want to raise some considerations on what might and might not help us getting things back on track. To do so the main question is of course: why should we have to put it back on track? If we proclaim the end of internationalisation, why revive a corpse? It is the process and its different approaches which need, in our view, reorientation. This implies that the end is also the beginning of a new internationalisation. We advocate a reorientation towards outcomes and impacts and away from a purely input and output approach. Instead of bragging about the number of students going abroad and hosting of international fee paying students, the number of courses in English and the abstract claim of making students global citizens, we want to focus on learning outcomes. How can we make sure that students receive the right learning outcomes that make them ready for a world that is more and more interculturally and internationally connected? What does that mean for faculty development? What are the implications for the assessment of students? How can instruments such as study abroad, international classrooms, teaching in another language, recruitment of international students and cross-border delivery, contribute to that process? In other words: how can we make sure that all students and not only the small elite of already internationally-oriented students and faculty receive the basic intercultural and international skills and knowledge they need in current society? Is it possible to look at new ways of internationalisation such as virtual exchange? Can we learn from experiences with internationalising secondary education and build on them? Or are we sticking to the classic concepts of cross-border mobility? In recent years we have seen good practices of new approaches to internationalisation; we should embrace them and incorporate them. Without denying the importance and good work of international offices, internationalisation has to move out of these offices and become part of curriculum development, quality assurance, faculty development. In our perception the issue is not the commonly claimed divides between competition and cooperation, between at home and abroad, or between the institution and the student that have to drive the process. Instead, it should be the focus on outcomes and so on the question of why and how internationalisation can contribute to the improvement of quality of education. If we proclaim the end of internationalisation, why revive a corpse? Uwe Brandenburg is project manager and partner at the Centre for Higher Education Development Consult, Germany.

It brings together institutions and organisations from some 120 countries for reflection and action on common concerns and collaborates with various international, regional and national bodies active in higher education. Its services are available on the priority basis to members but also to organisations, institutions and authorities concerned with higher education, as well as to individual policy and decision-makers, specialists, administrators, teachers, researchers and students.

    "text": "Blustery winds are sending blizzards of blossom whirling around, although this month&apos;s rains came just in time to get plants growing and prevent trees from developing stunted leaves in drought-stricken areas. How much more rain will fall may depend on a fascinating competition between the oak and ash to see which one will open their leaves first, as weatherlore says &quot;Oak before ash we&apos;ll have a splash, Ash before oak we&apos;re in for a soak&quot;. The race is currently running neck-and-neck  oaks are more sensitive to temperature and got off to a flying start in the warm weather of March, but slowed down in the cool weather this April and the ashes are now catching up. The warm March also got some bluebells flowering ridiculously early, even as far north as Inverness. But this month the usual carpets of bluebells in woodlands have been very patchy, especially in southern Britain, and other classic spring flowers, such as primroses, have also been somewhat disappointing. The blame may be the dry conditions in March and winter or last year&apos;s drought. One flower of April that thrives on rain is the snake&apos;s head fritillary, found growing in water meadows. The flowers have a fabulous purple and lilac chequered pattern and look like a Tiffany lamp shade on a reading light. The plant is now becoming increasingly rare as water meadows disappear, but a famous place to see them is Magdalen College Meadow in the heart of Oxford.",

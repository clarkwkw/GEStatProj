    "text": "This week on Science Weekly James Randerson, the Guardian&apos;s science and environment news editor, meets Neil Shubin to discuss his new book, The Universe Within: A Scientific Adventure in which he unearths the common history of rocks, planets and people. Shubin&apos;s book covers an epic sweep of science, from the big bang through the formation of the solar system to the evolution of life and people. Plus, Alok Jha interviews Dr Kevin Dutton about his book The Wisdom of Psychopaths, which attempts to overturn some of the common misconceptions about psychopathy, and asks whether we can learn valuable lessons from this mental condition. We hear from Guardian space blogger Stuart Clark about his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company ahead of their new production of Bertolt Brecht&apos;s A Life of Galileo.  Finally, Observer science editor Robin McKie looks back at 30 years of the GM debate. Subscribe for free via iTunes to ensure every episode gets delivered. (Here is the non-iTunes URL feed).

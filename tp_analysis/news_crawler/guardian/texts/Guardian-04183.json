The private sector remains committed to high-quality tuition, choice and value for money. Finding a good-quality private college to study for your degree has never been easier. Magna Carta launched its first undergraduate degree programme, a BA (Hons) in business studies and a one-year BA (Hons) top up from a higher national diploma (HND) a year ago. The degree has three streams, marketing, accounting and finance and international business, which are validated by the University of Wales and University of Gloucestershire. Home students from Oxfordshire and neighbouring Buckinghamshire are invited to apply for a 500 bursary. The undergraduate tuition fee is 5,000 and Magna Carta has a pre-existing MA and MBA programme. &quot;We&apos;re quite small so we only take on top-quality academic staff,&quot; says vice dean Maggie Faulkner. &quot;Students can also have membership of the Oxford Union,&quot; she adds. In the heart of London&apos;s Soho, St Patrick&apos;s International College offers over 1,000 students a wide range of Btec HNDs and degrees from creative subjects like photography and fashion design to business management and computing. Degrees are awarded by various UK universities including the University of London for which St Patrick&apos;s runs an external programme. &quot;The University of London offers degrees by distance learning and we help students work through the course materials,&quot; says director of education Raj Kumaran. Prospective students can apply to St Patrick&apos;s College through UCAS and degrees are eligible for a student loan. Tuition fees range from 5,000 to 6,000 and, according to Kumaran, private colleges like his offer a more personalised approach, a better student experience and a value for money proposition. &quot;A high staff- student ratio is an important part of our value proposition. Staff have an open-door policy and we also run a 24-hour welfare helpline,&quot; hesays. With degree-awarding status, the University of Buckingham and BPP University College offer two-year undergraduate degrees. Buckingham&apos;s two-year degrees in the arts and humanities are longestablished. Of Buckingham&apos;s 1,000 undergraduates, 40% are from the UK and EU, a percentage that is rising. &quot;We&apos;re one of the few universities to offer four full terms,&quot; says marketing and admissions manager Debbie Millns. From September fees rise to 11,250 a year for home and EU students, of which only 6,000 is eligible for a student loan. But the higher fees contribution from students can be offset by the fact that students can take the degree in two years and the attention given to delivering value for money. For the last few years Buckingham has come out on top of the Ipsos Mori student satisfaction poll. And according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency 96% of Buckingham graduates were either in employment or full-time study within three months of leaving uni. Libby Bhakar, 23, a student of English literature, says that she chose Buckingham because of its two-year degree. &quot;I had been studying at another university where English literature was suddenly dropped from the menu,&quot; she says. &quot;I thought I would have to start from the beginning but then I found Buckingham. &quot;It&apos;s brilliant because, although you have to work very hard, you can get through the material at a fantastic rate and the lecturers are second to none.&quot; Cassie McCormack, first-year student, psychology and French, University of Buckingham The thing I liked about Buckingham was its international studentpopulation. I was born in Hong Kong so I am open to mixing with people from different cultures. And as a mature student [at 24], I found I would fit in better because the ages are morebalanced. It&apos;s much smaller than a state universityand I think you get a closer community of people. I found lots of friends in university halls and on my course. I think having four terms is an advantage  I don&apos;t miss having a long summer break. May to October is a long time out of education. You&apos;re stopping learningand then having to pick up again. In terms of tuition fees, at Buckingham you get small class sizes and the space and time to ask questions  to me it represents good value formoney.     Guardian students sign up banner  ",

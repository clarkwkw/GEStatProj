    "text": "After a missed week last week, this week is a bumper 30 Best post for new Android apps, covering the last fortnight. The list doesn&apos;t include games, as they get their own separate post: this week&apos;s selection included Android titles like Ayakashi: Ghost Guild, Beach Buggy Blitz, Arsenal Fantasy Manager 2013 and Contract Killer 2. iOS apps get their own separate post too: you can find that here. For now, here&apos;s the pick of the Google Play store from the last two weeks. Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown In good time for Halloween, this book-app from Loud Crow Interactive sees Charlie Brown and his Peanuts friends waiting for the Great Pumpkin, with lots of interactivity, voices and music from a 1966 TV special, and a Peanuts avatar creator to help children make their own characters. Dragon Mobile Assistant (Beta) I&apos;ll get the disappointing news out of the way first: this doesn&apos;t appear to be available in the UK yet. It&apos;s Nuance&apos;s new conversational assistant software for Android devices, which is in beta for devices running the Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean variants. It has you making calls, sending texts, updating social networks, using maps, reserving restaurants and other tasks by chatting. Musicovery Player Musicovery is one of a crop of apps encouraging people to play music by their mood, picking songs from their own collections, but also making its own recommendations for tracks that they don&apos;t own already. Fontly One for designers and the design-conscious, this: an app to &quot;capture, map, and explore the world of vintage typography&quot;, with a map-based guide to interesting signs and typography in the real world. You&apos;re encouraged to upload and tag your own examples too. PerfMon - Performance Monitor There&apos;s a buzz around the PerfMon utility, which is a floating performance monitor tool that hovers over an app that you&apos;re using, showing how your device is running. Useful for developers, or for other Android users who suspect an app is a tad crunchy on the processor. Ubertalk DAR.fm&apos;s Ubertalk app has a job on its hands swaying Android radio-heads away from TuneIn Radio and other apps. Still, it&apos;s worth a look: streaming music and talk radio, as well as the ability to record some shows for listening at your leisure. Jaxtr Voice: Cheap Int&apos;l Calls Voice-over-IP apps are ten-a-penny on Android, so can Jaxtr&apos;s new international-focused one cut through the clutter? It makes calls via 3G or Wi-Fi, as well as offering access numbers in 40 countries when neither is available. Some countries can be called for free, and online voicemail is included. Free calls - Comm Also covered in this week&apos;s iOS roundup, this is a curveball app from DeNA, which is best known for its social mobile games. Comm is another Voice-over-IP app, which adds photo-sharing and instant messaging into the mix. BeerMap.co Remember the days on iOS when virtual pints of beer were all the rage? BeerMap is an app that wants to get Android users supping pints in the real world: a &quot;social beer tasting app&quot; for drinkers to share their ratings and notes for both tipples and pubs in the UK. Skypath for Android Skypath is the latest social photography app for Android, which runs alongside a desktop application of the same name. The idea: it synchronises photos between your Android device, your PC and the ImageShack storage service. Rightmove Samsung TV Remote This is a niche app, but it&apos;s an interesting sign of the way things may develop for other apps in the near future. It has one use: &quot;Use your Android as a remote for the RightmoveTV app on Samsung 2012 SmartTVs&quot;, developed by Rightmove itself, the online property site. The app can also send texts and call individual estate agents, and share details of properties on social networks. The Official Alibaba App Hong Kong-based B2B marketplace Alibaba now has an Android app for searching its millions of products, browsing suppliers and contacting them with enquiries. The app also saves favourite products for later reference. Limeseum This is an app tied to one specific location: the ancient Roman fort at Ruffenhofen in Germany, but I thought it was worth including for its glimpse at how augmented reality technology is good for more than adverts jumping out of chocolate bar wrappers. Designed to be used while walking around the fort, it offers videos, panoramic pics and text about the site. Timeline - Art Museum And more culture here: an app that offers paintings from 80 masters (Da Vinci, Van Gogh and Monet included) arranged in a timeline from the Renaissance through to the present day. Every work and artist gets their own profile, although the developer appears to be hoping the use of some copyrighted works will squeak through &quot;in accordance with fair use principles&quot;, which could be interesting. Doodle Joy Android-owning parents have an increasing collection of good apps for their children to use, with Doodle Joy being a welcome addition to the list. It&apos;s a drawing app for kids offering more than 20 digital brushes, and the ability to save the process of drawing, not just the final image. Hotels by Orbitz Hotel-bookings is a hot area on all smartphones at the moment, with Orbitz&apos;s new app the latest trying to help people book a room and get a discount. In this case, the latter can include up to 50% off listed prices, with the promise of thousands of hotels to choose from globally. FusionPro Music Player Beta There&apos;s always scope for improvement of the default music players in smartphones and tablets. FusionPlayer is trying to make Android&apos;s &quot;simpler and easier&quot;, with a single screen containing the entire player. It also pulls in lyrics and YouTube videos. Twythm Another music app here, but one focused on social sharing. In fact, it&apos;s focused on Twitter: a quick way for Android devices to share details of the song currently being played with friends. Aviary Stickers: Football This is an add-on pack for Aviary&apos;s Photo Editor and really an excuse to write again about that app, which is excellent. Like the company&apos;s other packs (grunge, nostalgia etc) it provides 15 virtual stickers with which to customise photos, then share them with friends. The football is the American variety, by the way. Photo Punch Photo punch? Nothing to do with violence. Instead, this is about cutting out a portion of one photo, then pasting it into another. Cat head on human bodies, that kind of thing. Memes. Anyway, it&apos;s a quirky take on photo manipulation that appears to be sprouting wings on the Google Play store. Educam Classroom Viewer Another app that&apos;s a sign of how technology is developing this time in classrooms. It&apos;s an app for viewing, capturing, annotating and sharing live images from a document camera, visualiser or digital microscope, for use in classrooms where students have their own devices to hand to watch on. InstaMessage &quot;Less talking more wub wub&quot; reads one of the sample messages in the Google Play screenshots for this photo-manipulation app, designed to be used with Instagram. The idea: use themes created by its designers with your own words, posting to Instagram but also Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Pinterest. GreenDay - Autism Behavior Actually, this is an app for all children, not just those with autism even if the latter are its initial target group. For parents, it&apos;s about putting in place a behaviour plan for a child, who earns tokens for behaving well, with a colour-based system letting them know when they need to moderate their actions. The app supports up to three children. Pedometer Plus Not just a Pedometer! It&apos;s a Pedometer Plus! What&apos;s the plus? That would be measuring more than just the number of steps you take: think calories, speed and time. It also tracks your routes using GPS, although the feature can be turned off if you prefer to save battery life. NewsBlur Flipboard and the rest mean it&apos;s tough for any new social news-reader app to get a foothold on the major smartphone platforms. NewsBlur is having a go though: a way to read articles via Google Reader, share and comment on them with friends, and see what other people with similar tastes are reading too. Gratafy Another US-only app for now: an &quot;experience-based social gifting platform&quot;. That means sending real things to friends as gifts via social networks: food, drinks and desserts at a range of venues, which can then be redeemed in those places by using the app. Movember Mobile It&apos;s nearly that time of year again, when men up and down the land start growing furry upper-lip slugs and raising money for charity. Movember now has an Android app too: helping people manage their fundraising campaigns, and post updates and photos on the Movember site. Halloween - 13 Free Apps It&apos;s nearly Halloween. Is anyone really looking for &quot;free Halloween apps&quot; and an app to find them? That&apos;s what MagicSolver is hoping, with the promise of an unlucky 13 app recommendations in and around Halloween. abtoVNC Viewer for Android This is a showcase for its developer&apos;s SDK for other developers, rather than an app for consumers. It&apos;s a viewer app for logging in to remote desktops, altering their settings and then working with files stored on the computer. There&apos;s lots of competition in this area, though. HSA Skin Cancer Awareness This is very much a professional app: for hair and beauty staff. The idea being it helps them learn and recognise the signs of skin cancer among their clients. It ties into a wider skin cancer awareness campaign in the UK. That&apos;s our selection, but what new Android apps have you been using this week?

Image: Dan Logen, 5 February 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorize].Nikon D300s, 600 mm lens, f/5, 1/400 sec, ISO 1000    Question: This Ethiopian mystery bird has been placed into three taxonomic families (at least). Additionally, it will be difficult to identify this species from this image. Nonetheless, can you identify this bird&apos;s current taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult red-fronted barbet, Tricholaema diademata, a member of the African barbet family, Lybiidae. It is sometimes included in the toucan family, Ramphastidae, as well as another family, the American barbets, Capitonidae. Even though they were separated, these three families are apparently closely related and are all included in the taxonomic order, Piciformes. This taxonomic order encompasses nine avian families, the most familiar of which is probably the woodpeckers, Pidicae.  Red-fronted barbet is a solitary arboreal species found in open bush, dry woodland, acacia scrub and riparian forests throughout northeastern Africa. These birds consume a wide variety of fruits and insects (including termites and ants) as well as small vertebrates and seeds.  This uncommon bird has a plump body shape, a large head and heavy bill with a broad yellow &quot;eyebrow&quot; stripe. The red-fronted barbet can be confused with several other species:  distinguished from the similar red-fronted tinkerbird, Pogoniulus pusillus, by the red-fronted barbet&apos;s much larger body size and heavier bill, by its yellow supercilliary stripe, its lack of a white mustache stripe and lack of white around its eyes. Further, although you can&apos;t see it in this photograph, the red-fronted barbet&apos;s underparts are paler yellow and it lacks the golden wing patch of its smaller relative  distinguished from the similar spot-flanked barbet, T. lacrymosa, by the red-fronted barbet&apos;s larger body size, dark eye, red forehead, lack of a black throat and by its faintly spotted flanks. The red-fronted barbet also favours drier habitats than the spot-flanked barbet   distinguished from the similar black-throated barbet, T. melanocephala, by the red-fronted barbet&apos;s red forehead, lack of a black throat and breast patch and faint flank spots. The red-fronted barbet also favours wetter habitats than the black-throated barbet You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

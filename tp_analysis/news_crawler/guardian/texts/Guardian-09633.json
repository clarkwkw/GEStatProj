    "text": "Time was when British bottoms were built to withstand the crinkliest, shiniest toilet paper available, and in some cases even to enjoy it. But there has been a fundamental softening in recent years, seen in a growing preference not only for quilted loo roll, but now for wet wipes. The musician Will.i.Am is one leading exponent of damp bottom-wiping. The consequences for our drains, though, are disastrous. &quot;If you swill a piece of toilet roll around in some water, it takes seconds for it to disintegrate,&quot; explains Simon Evans from Thames Water. &quot;Wet wipes should never be put down drains, because they don&apos;t break down  even if the packaging says they are &apos;biodegradable&apos; or &apos;flushable&apos;. Only human waste and loo roll should go down our sewers.&quot; Ignoring this advice causes blockages, especially in suburban areas where the pipes are narrowest  anything from 6in to 12in in diameter. And blockages, well, they cause unspeakable things. &quot;It can result in sewage backing up on to streets, into gardens, into parks,&quot; says Evans, &quot;and in some cases  around 1,000 a year  we have sewage backing up into people&apos;s homes which, believe me, is one of the most vile things that can ever happen to you.&quot; For Will.i.Am and other fussier-bottomed people, a spray called Freshu can be used to moisten the final sheets of toilet paper. &quot;It gives you the same wiping firepower as a wet wipe,&quot; Evans says, &quot;but without the sewer-clogging consequences.&quot;",

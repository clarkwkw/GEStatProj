    "text": "This week&apos;s Science Weekly is dedicated to a feature interview with the winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Professor Daniel Shechtman.  Shechtman, who works at Technion  Israel Institute of Technology, discovered rare crystal forms called quasicrystals in 1982. The discovery was controversial and he was undermined by another Nobel laureate, Linus Pauling, who famously said: &quot;There are no such thing as quasicrystals, only quasiscientists.&quot;  Alok Jha asks Shechtman how his life and career have changed since he won his Nobel. They also discuss the difficulty of making a discovery that challenges scientific orthodoxy. Read Alok&apos;s feature about Shechtman in the Observer.

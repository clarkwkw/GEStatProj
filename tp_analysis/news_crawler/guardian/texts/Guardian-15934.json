    "headline": "Should first year count towards your degree?", 
    "text": "As final year students prepare to sit their summer exams, many will share one wish: that their first year marks counted. The debate about whether first year exams should influence a student&apos;s final result has divided opinion for years. But as universities examine the possibility of replacing traditional degree classifications with Grade Point Average (GPA)  a new marking system where graduates receive a point score  the discussion is heating up. Nottingham University education officer Matt Styles explained, &quot;In many countries using GPA, the first year does count towards the degree, and for many every year counts as equal. &quot;Moving forwards, it&apos;s incredibly unlikely every year will count as equal  even Oxford Brookes, which has implemented GPA alongside classifications, isn&apos;t doing that.&quot; He points to a Nottingham University survey which asked 1,000 students whether they thought their first year should count towards their final degree result. Two thirds said it should not. Respondents explained that those students taking new subjects should be given a chance to familiarise themselves with their degree. Others argued that young people might need time to settle in and get used to living away from home. In my response, I argued that it was a bad idea to make first year count. Having taken a gap year after A-levels, it took a while for me to readjust to being back in education. But not all students feel the same. A significant proportion said that, given the recent fee increase to 9,000, having a year which does not count seems like waste of money. Politics student Emily Tripp argued, &quot;It doesn&apos;t make sense to have a &apos;practice&apos; year in the year when you&apos;re doing the least outside of your degree. Either make the first semester not count, or get lecturers to set practice essays that don&apos;t count.&quot; English student Antonia Paget agreed, &quot;I think students don&apos;t learn the disciplines of university during their first year as everyone gets complacent; second year is therefore a huge step up for some. If first year counted then students would learn what was expected of them earlier in their university careers.&quot; For the majority of the student population, the 40% pass mark is all that is required to pass into second year, meaning that lectures are often sacrificed for nights out. A member of a HR department told me that they generally focus on the final grade as opposed to looking over transcripts; however this is not the case for all industries. Some companies, for example law firms, request transcripts from potential employees which display the results for every module taken at university  including first year. In such circumstances, 40% may not always be enough. It is clear that on the back of the rise in fees and an increasingly challenging job market, students are looking to get more for their money. While starting university undoubtedly takes some getting used to, it may not always make sense for students to take a whole year to do so.",

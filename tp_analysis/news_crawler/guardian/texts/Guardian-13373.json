    "text": "From flying cities to robotic George Washington lookalikes packing gatling guns, the forthcoming first-person adventure Bioshock: Infinite is set to be one of the most fascinating game releases of the year. A key feature of the title is set to be the character Elizabeth, who players must rescue from the floating metropolis of Columbia. Developer Irrational Games has claimed that she exhibits some of the most advanced AI ever seen in a video game.  To discuss Elizabeth, Bioshock and the evolution of AI, Ken Levine will be appearing on stage at Bafta, on Monday night. The event begins at 8.30pm and after a presentation on the game, Levine will be answering questions posed by Guardian games writer, Simon Parkin. There will also be time for audience questions. It will be a remarkable chance to meet the man behind one of this year&apos;s most anticipated titles - and we have 35 tickets to give away to Guardian readers. You just need to go to the events booking page and enter the code &apos;Parkin&apos;. You can select either one or two tickets but please only opt for two if you are certain you can use the extra place.  There will be drinks and the chance to chat with Ken in the bar afterwards. Come along!  The Ken Levine event is taking place at Bafta&apos;s Princess Anne Theatre at 8.30pm on 11 March. The ticketing system is arranged and organised by Bafta.",

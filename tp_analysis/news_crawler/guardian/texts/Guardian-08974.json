    "text": "There are 60,000 fewer students in English and Welsh universities this year (University chiefs fear for the future after admissions chaos, 10 September). This is a symptom of a process that is eradicating the egalitarian and educational ethos of higher education, and replacing it with the imperatives of individual and corporate calculation. Staff, students and applicants are to be driven by narrow, personal and pecuniary calculations in judging what to research and what to study. In an increasingly market-driven sector, institutions are being forced to &quot;rebrand&quot; to compete for market share, rather than co-operate as collegial, scholarly adventures. The chaotic treatment of overseas students at London Metropolitan University is the latest graphic evidence of this intent. Society as a whole is being damaged. Research output is being skewed, while independent learning and critical thought are being erased by a creeping culture of &quot;service provision&quot;, turning students into customers. Some institutions risk bankruptcy and being sold in their entirety. Widespread hostility to these policies exists in universities, but since the student protests against fees in autumn 2010, no comparable opposition has arisen. We cannot let this continue. We invite all those opposed to these changes to join the TUC march for A Future That Works on 20 October and to come together at a Convention in Defence of Higher Education in December. This will be an open convention of staff, students, parents and educationists  to determine what needs to be reversed in government policy and what action needs to be taken.

The Student Loans Company is a government-owned organisation and its revenue comes from taxpayers. Did Clegg bother to work out how many years/decades it will take for the supplementary 9% tax on future graduate salaries over 21,000 to generate a significant repayment stream? In the meanwhile, taxpayers (graduate and non-graduate) will continue to cover the shortfall via loans to pay for the fees  paid directly to the universities. Bizarre attempts to disarm critics by pointing out that many graduates will never fully repay the loans indicate something amiss in the long-term projections. Before this ill-considered scheme deters more school leavers, the public must be shown the calculations on which the coalition is placing so much faith. Professor Clive CoenSchool of medicine, King&apos;s College London  I have been struck by two recent news items. First, the UK is appointing &quot;bounty hunters&quot; to root out foreign students and make sure that they do not overstay their study visas, forcibly removing them if they continue to overstay. Meanwhile, in the US, both Democratic and Republican parties support creating 55,000 green cards every year to encourage foreign students in the Stem subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to stay in the US after graduating, rather than see them employed by competitor countries. Which of these two countries has the greater long-term vision?John FlemingEdinburgh",

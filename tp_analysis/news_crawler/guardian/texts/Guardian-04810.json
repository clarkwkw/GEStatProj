    "text": "The view of the river bank in front of me was one of contrasts. Below me the waters seemed to be in a desperate hurry to reach the sea as they gurgled and splashed around boulders and small islands. Some of the islands were capped with woodrush and occasional bluebells, the latter only just in full flower. Upstream the river was so calm it seemed as if it did not want to go anywhere. Even the dimples from the rising small trout spread outwards until the tiny wavelets reached either bank. I had come to see whether the sand martins had returned to their very small colony on this stretch of the river. Last year was a disaster for the seven pairs that bred in a low bank. One day the river had risen until it was in spate, just as the sand martin chicks were about to fly. Almost all the youngsters in theirburrows had been washed away and drowned. I need not have worried because the first bird I saw was a sand martin swooping past and dipping at the surface of the water to take an insect. This year, perhaps, they would be lucky, unlike the resident dippers. A few weeks ago the dippers had been incubating their eggs and the river suddenly rose and washed out their nests. Such are the vagaries of the Highland rivers. While I was relieved to see the sand martins, there was also plenty else to see and hear. Curlews were calling, and to me these are some of the most haunting and melancholy calls at this time of the year. A common sandpiper suddenly whirled past with that characteristic flight on wings that seem arched in a perfect downward curved shape. Meanwhile theotter&apos;s tracks below me made mewonder where it was holed up in its holt.",

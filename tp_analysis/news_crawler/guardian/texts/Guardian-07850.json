    "text": "After something of a troubled path to market  originally a True Crime title, then cancelled, before switching publishers and gaining a new name  Sleeping Dogs escapes development hell and proves to be one of the best crime games in years. Playing as Chinese-American cop Wei Shen, the game sees players infiltrating an arm of the triad in Hong Kong. Cue some serious violence and dubious police work as you balance Wei&apos;s original mission with increasing power earned from escalating notoriety in the underworld. Completing objectives for each faction earns points to unlock skills unique to them, leading to some conflicting moral choices. Combat is a blend of fisticuffs and shooting, with plenty of vehicular action on the side. Though Wei&apos;s most common combos involve hammering the attack button, additional grapples, counters and finishers mix sorties up nicely. You&apos;ll soon be composing scenes right out of a John Woo movie, which, I suppose, is rather the point. The script and attendant voice acting is superb, bolstered by brilliant cut-scene animation with precise facial movements capturing the actors&apos; performances. Sleeping Dogs is an outstanding romp through the seedy underbelly of one of the world&apos;s most vibrant cities  it&apos;s so good that the upcoming GTA V might have cause for concern.",

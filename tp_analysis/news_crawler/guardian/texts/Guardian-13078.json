    "text": "What caused the global financial crisis? Who should own ideas in the internet age? What is poverty and how should we measure it? Different social science disciplines will approach these questions with different methodologies, and the LSE is determined that its students should understand the range of alternative approaches they can apply to the urgent debates of modern times.  &quot;Neither the big questions we face nor the methods of social science fit neatly into disciplinary boxes,&quot; says Dr Jonathan Leape, director of the LSE100 programme. &quot;The only way to tackle complex issues like poverty, climate change, financial crises and intellectual property rights in the internet age is to provide students with the skills necessary to relate subject-specific knowledge and methods to the findings of other disciplines.&quot; So if you start a degree at the LSE today, don&apos;t imagine you&apos;ll be able to stick narrowly to your chosen subject. The institution has developed a compulsory interdisciplinary course that sees all undergraduates spending two terms exploring these questions from a range of perspectives with immediate, frequent and one-to-one feedback. Developing the course has required an extensive training programme for a teaching team of over 50 academic staff, the embedding of interactive technologies into course delivery and the resources for self-paced learning on Moodle, with the aim of encouraging intellectual breadth in what Leape calls &quot;an HE environment of increasing specialisation.&quot; Stories from LSE series.",

    "text": "As you may well have heard by now, Namco has announced that it&apos;s bringing From Software&apos;s relentless masterpiece Dark Souls to PC. Subtitled &apos;The Prepare To Die Edition&apos; (because, you know, we didn&apos;t die enough in the console version), the fresh version will feature exclusive new content and an enhanced PVP mode, &quot;allowing players to more closely assemble battles against oneanother online in an all-out fight to the death that fans have demanded&quot;. The additional content is still mostly under wraps, but the publisher&apos;s press release does highlight a whole extra chapter, &apos;Artorias of the Abyss&apos;, which will include new areas, enemies and bosses. The conversion has been undertaken by the original dev team at From Software and is likely to include a few other surprises.  Later on today, we&apos;ll be in a group interview with producer Hidetaka Miyazaki and should be able to fire at least a couple of questions in his direction. If you have anything you want to ask about the conversion, or Dark Souls in general, let me know via the comments section!",

    "text": "Unemployment is big news around the world. This week, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said the world must create 600m new jobs over the next decade to address the &quot;global jobs crisis&quot;. In this Global development podcast, we look at the causes and consequences of joblessness around the world, focusing particularly on Tunisia and Egypt, where youth protests against economic exclusion and unemployment helped spark the Arab spring revolutions of 2011.  What&apos;s behind the global jobs crisis? What needs to happen to address the worldwide demand for more  and better  jobs? How can developing countries avoid the pitfalls of &quot;jobless growth&quot;? And how have prospects changed in Tunisia and Egypt, one year on from the demonstrations that toppled the Ben Ali and Mubarak regimes? To discuss these issues, John Vidal, the Guardian&apos;s environment editor, is joined in the studio by Adam Hanieh, a lecturer in development at SOAS focusing on labour markets and globalisation, and Heike Harmgart, a senior regional economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. They are joined, down the line from Cairo, by Hania Sholkamy, an Egyptian economist at the American University of Cairo specialising in health and gender issues.  We also hear from young people in Tunis, and from Larry Elliott, the Guardian&apos;s economics editor.",

Click here to view  While structurally similar to Forza Horizon with its public roads, bonus-giving speed cameras, oncoming traffic and GPS-guided cruises between events, the action couldn&apos;t be more different. In Need For Speed: Most Wanted, races are won through a combination of luck, aggression and wild, seat-of-the-pants driving as you weave your way to victory by fair means and foul. Its heart-pounding race events segue into police chases that encourage you to explore dirt-track shortcuts, railway lines and goods yards in an effort to lose your &quot;heat&quot;. Made by the same developer as the awesome Burnout series, it&apos;s a raucous, dangerous-driving masterpiece.",

    "headline": "Addison Lee hit by protest and boycott following chairman comments", 
    "text": "What started with a comment in a company magazine has turned into a major campaign against one of the UK&apos;s biggest minicab firms, uniting black cabs with cyclists and encompassing a protest, a twitter boycott campaign and a petition to have Addison Lee&apos;s license withdrawn. In his company&apos;s magazine, Add Lib, Addison Lee chairman John Griffin sparked widespread anger by suggesting that cyclist death and injury is inevitable as cyclist numbers increase, and is largely the fault of untrained cyclists. When I spoke to Griffin on Monday night at his London headquarters, it was striking that  in spite of the crowd gathered in protest  he still seemed to feel he was essentially in the right. Last night&apos;s &quot;die-in&quot; outside Addison Lee&apos;s offices was a Facebook campaign that quickly grew from an anger at the article&apos;s tone, which Griffin agrees was &quot;perhaps a little too inflammatory&quot;, to an event with an about 250 attendees  including black cab drivers  and live TV coverage. Die-in organiser Beth Anderson said: &quot;The frustration we all personally feel simply trying to cycle around London has become, in the last few days, a very public thing.&quot; Griffin said: &quot;There are a lot of people out there riding bikes and they plainly haven&apos;t had training. They haven&apos;t got a clue and they shouldn&apos;t be on the roads. They are a danger to themselves.&quot; He had just returned from an injunction hearing after recently encouraging his drivers to use bus lanes illegally. Mustafa Arif, of the London Cycling Campaign, said: &quot;I think a company whose chairman goes around making these sorts of remarks and encouraging people to break the law isn&apos;t fit to hold a licence.&quot; There are many others who feel the same: the petition to withdraw Addison Lee&apos;s licence already has more than 3,700 signatures. Meanwhile, the ongoing Twitter campaign #boycottaddisonlee is growing apace, while users are rallying against the AddLee app, which earn the company 23m in fares in 2011. Contrary to Griffin&apos;s comments, motorists are responsible for up to 75% of collisions involving cyclists, many happen of which when drivers &quot;fail to look properly&quot;. University lecturer Douglas Cowie echoed what many felt at last night&apos;s die-in: that Griffin&apos;s comments, coming from his position of power, could influence drivers negatively against cyclists. Meanwhile, David Dansky of Cycle Training UK is offering free cycle training to Addison Lee drivers. &quot;If someone steps out off the pavement with a mobile phone I am responsible [as a cyclist] for not hitting them. It is the responsibility of people who can cause the harm,&quot; he said. The backlash has shown that cyclists are far from a marginalised road user group: with thousands of Londoners expected at this weekend&apos;s Big Ride, calling on London mayoral candidates to make streets safer for cyclists. More than 34,000 people have signed the LCC&apos;s Go Dutch campaign and the Times newspaper&apos;s Cyclesafe campaign has thousands of backers. Green party mayoral candidate Jenny Jones&apos;s early addition to the Addison Lee boycott was perhaps no surprise, but former deputy prime minister John Prescott is also backing it, and he doesn&apos;t even cycle. Meanwhile, scores of customers have vowed on Twitter to move their custom elsewhere and close company accounts. Griffin&apos;s article opens with the line: &quot;Green party campaigners and others are up in arms about what they see as the murder of cyclists on London&apos;s roads.&quot; It now appears many of those people were his customers.",

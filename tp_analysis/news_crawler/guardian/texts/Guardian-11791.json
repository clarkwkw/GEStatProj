    "text": "A lot of people will be looking at the If campaign to see if it has the potential to achieve its laudable aims. Can we really end hunger? Everyone working in development and beyond would desperately like to do so. Campaigning is a challenging business at the best of times. As campaigners, we need to be able to motivate the public to inspire political and personal action  this is true for everything from breast cancer awareness to action on climate change. And getting the message right is no small task. The If campaign emerges just a few years after Make Poverty History, a simplified message, which certainly inspired the public but failed to meet its objectives. The World Development Movement has been campaigning for justice for more than 40 years. In that time, we&apos;ve tackled aid, trade, water privatisation and speculation on food commodities. None of the issues we tackle are easy because most are aimed at systemic, long-term change. And although we aim to use simple messages, such as &quot;Stop betting on hunger&quot;, our members and allies who campaign with us know there is no magic bullet. We&apos;re on a journey to create a more just system and challenge the power structures that undermine poverty reduction. If proposes policy options aimed at ending hunger: more aid, stopping companies dodging taxes, stopping land grabbing for biofuels and other crops, and forcing governments and companies to be more transparent about their investments in developing countries. These are all important things that we need to achieve but, to end hunger and poverty, we need to go much further and tackle their root causes. This means tackling the power of the finance sector and its role in not only pushing up food prices but prioritising investment in crops that make a huge profit, like maize, over those that may be more sustainable and locally appropriate, like millet. And while If rightly highlights the undue power of agribusiness, it fails to mention that sector&apos;s role in the latest push for GM crops. GM may increase output in the short term, but it increases dependency on fossil fuel-based fertiliser in the long term, while pushing farmers in developing countries into heavy debt as they can no longer save their own seeds. More importantly, perhaps, we can&apos;t ignore the impact of trade. As trade talks have stalled, bilateral trade between the UK and the rest of Europe and poorer countries continues. This is despite analysis by the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier de Schutter, who has found little evidence to show that trade liberalisation directly leads to improved food security. Free trade has enabled transnational corporations to capture the bulk of added value in most globalised food chains, and leads to increased concentration of the production of food, where diversity and de-concentration is actually needed. We&apos;ve seen that countries with stronger, localised food systems have been less vulnerable to volatile food prices in recent years and have been able to feed their people more effectively. And even when the UK government meets its target to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid, if the money is spent on propping up agribusiness and increasing private power over public services like water, then the target will do little to feed the world or achieve genuine redistribution of wealth. I would never argue against the G8 and international community ending tax dodging; nor would I argue against stopping land grabbing, or stopping food crops being diverted to biofuels. I fully endorse the need to support smallholder farmers. And I&apos;m a great advocate of corporate transparency. However, the policy solutions in themselves don&apos;t provide the impetus to address power in our unjust globalised food system and our politics. Ensuring everyone has enough to eat is a long-term project that demands far deeper and wide-ranging policy change than that proposed by If, and needs democratic change well beyond the power of the G8. By all means, support the campaign&apos;s individual aims, but ending hunger demands that we go further.",

    "text": "    I&apos;ve always been amused by the rampant superstition associated with the number 666, particularly by religious folks. This number, famed as &quot;the number of The Beast&quot; or &quot;the mark of The Beast&quot;, is assumed by many Christians to denote Satan. But who really was &quot;the Beast&quot;?    Unlike what many apocalyptic Christians believe, the biblical book of Revelation is often viewed by scholars as describing the failing Roman Empire, not as the final days of Earth. Thus, Revelation&apos;s &quot;666&quot; is likely used to refer to the emperor, Nero, who was not particularly fond of Christians.  To avoid persecution, the book of Revelation created a riddle to refer to Nero using numerical equivalents for each letter of his name, which was how both ancient Greek and Hebrew denoted numbers anyway. (Greek and Hebrew are the two main languages of the Bible.) Using this system, the numerical equivalent for Nero&apos;s name is either &quot;616&quot; or more famously, &quot;666&quot;. So it&apos;s safe (now) to state that the emperor Nero was very likely &quot;the Beast&quot; referred to in Revelation.  But how does 666 relate to the roulette table? The roulette table, originally invented by the famous French mathematician Blaise Pascal, was later modified by Franois Blanc into the Monte Carlo roulette table that we are familiar with. This wheel uses consecutive numbers from 1 to 36. These numbers add up to 666, making it a triangle number, a property that is explained further in the video.  But of course, people like to have fun with coincidences, so since &quot;666&quot; is &quot;the number of the Beast&quot; and since &quot;the Beast&quot; is mistakenly thought to be Satan, the rumour started that Blanc wrestled the secrets of the roulette table from the devil himself.  This interesting video explains more about the number 666:            [video link]. You&apos;ll also be pleased to note that this video is 11:06 long, which is 666 in Base60. Not sure what I am referring to? Take a closer look:  (11 minutes x 60 seconds/minute) + 6 seconds = 666 seconds 11 06 is also 666 in Base60 Unfortunately, I cannot find a Hebrew numerology site to figure out what number my name translates to, so I can&apos;t share that bit of trivia with you nor can I ask you what your number is.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

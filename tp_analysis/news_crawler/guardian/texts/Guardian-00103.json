    "text": "Sir Michael Wilshaw has cleared his diary and set aside a generous chunk of the morning for our interview. His press officer promises he will be in forthright mood and shes not wrong. At the end of December, Wilshaw, 70, will complete his five-year stint as chief inspector of schools and hes not going quietly.   Related: Ofsted chief slams Theresa Mays obsession with grammar schools    He wants to talk about how standards have improved since he took charge at Ofsted in 2012. But he is not one to do so in a vainglorious way. A former headteacher at one of the first academies in the country, in north-east London, he is proud of his legacy but also brutally honest about what more needs to be done, and about the difficulties of working with government. When people ask what has been the toughest part of my job, he says, it has been to deal with the politicians, particularly ministers of education. Because sometimes you have to say fairly uncomfortable things to them like, Some of your free schools arent working very well or Some of your academy trusts arent working very well or whatever, and thats sometimes been difficult. Wilshaw has 50 years of experience in education and says he understands the pressures under which ministers operate. They come in and they have got to make a difference and they have got to do it quickly and be seen to be making a difference. I understand that  but as the guy who is responsible for standards in schools they are obviously looking for me to say lovely things about their policy and that has been tough, he says. Hes mainly  but not solely  thinking of the man who appointed him as chief inspector, Michael Gove. Wilshaw says he likes Gove and thinks he will be remembered as a great secretary of state. He supported him over the need for more autonomy and accountability in the school systems, and over his reforms of the exam system and curriculum.    In my last year we sent a dozen kids off to Oxbridge. That would not have been possible without the top-end children  On non-selective education     All good, all good, he says. But, he adds, raising his voice, heres the thing, I think. And I have learnt this not just as chief inspector but also as a headteacher: that change sometimes has to be slow and incremental. Gove tried to go too fast, was badly advised, offended too many people and ended up losing his job. They had rows. If you push it too hard it becomes counterproductive. I am very conscious that politicians dont often have time and therefore they push and pull and shove and that gets them into trouble. Inevitably they come up against people like me who say, Sorry, that is not working and I am not prepared to do that because I dont think it will work. So there was a tension. If I had been his adviser I would have said, Dont do that yet. Michael needed better advice but didnt get it. Wilshaw is proud of the improvements they jointly oversaw and many of the changes that are still in train, with the expansion of academies and free schools, though it is standards he cares about more than structures. When I came in January 2012, 68% of primaries were good or better. Now its 89%. Secondaries 66%, now its 78%. We introduced greater demands into the system, had higher expectations and teachers and heads have risen to it. Early on in his tenure he abolished the category of satisfactory for schools. The education establishment protested. Michael Gove and I were seen as the terrible twins. Teachers and the unions said it was all too difficult. Their argument was that its too demanding, that some schools will be satisfactory. There were two million children in 6,000 schools that had been judged satisfactory year after year after year, inspection after inspection, so you could be in a satisfactory school forever and a day, primary or secondary.

He turned it round fast, and that made him believe anything is possible if heads aim high and are given more freedom. But he opposes blanket solutions. He was not, for instance, in favour of getting rid of all local education authorities or forcing all schools to become academies, as Goves successor, Nicky Morgan, tried to do earlier this year before she dropped the plan because of huge opposition. I didnt see much point in banging headteachers over the head who were running very successful schools within a local authority and saying, Youve got to become an academy. If somebody had done that to me when I was in Newham I would have said, No, Im quite happy, thank you. That said, he thinks the trend away from local authorities running schools is irreversible. The big criticism of [many] local authorities was they didnt know what was happening in these schools They didnt challenge schools as effectively as they should have done  They allowed drift and decay to take place.

Photograph: Felix Clay for the Observer    In his half century in schools, and during his years at Ofsted, he has seen huge progress. Wilshaw recalls thinking as a young teacher in the 1960s how wrong it was that the job of education secretary was not seen as a top Cabinet slot. Even in the 1980s that was still the case. I remember Ken Baker saying to me that when he was transferred from the Department of Environment to Education it felt like a demotion, like moving from Arsenal to Charlton Athletic. Now, however, as he prepares to leave Ofsted, he sees big dangers on the horizon. One is that too many multi-academy trusts are poorly run, failing to intervene when their schools are underperforming, replicating the failures of local authorities. Some have built up financial surpluses, and spent the money on consultancies not children. A few who run them have abused the system, awarding contracts with schools to their own companies. There are some rogues out there who use the greater freedoms that are given to headteachers and chief executives to line their own pockets. We have seen examples of that. Even more worrying to him, though, is the determination of new prime minister Theresa May to expand the number of grammar schools. Wilshaw believes this risks reversing all the progress of recent years, and creating social division as well. He turns Mays own rhetoric about wanting to govern for everyone against her. I came into teaching and I came into this job to raise standards for all children, not just for the few. By their very nature, grammar schools are for the few, otherwise why have them?    Which great education system has selection at 11? I dont know any  On grammar schools     Grammars, he says, will siphon off the best children, the most academic children and end the vital transfer of intellectual capital across the school. He cites his work at Mossbourne. In my last year we sent a dozen kids off to Oxbridge, 60% to Russell Group universities. That would not have been possible without top-end children who were so influential in the rest of the school. More grammars will actually lower standards for the great majority of children. That is my view. And it is socially divisive as well. He cant understand Mays assertion that grammars can be introduced in a way that lifts up all schools, and is aghast at her claim that the plans will not mean a return to a binary system. What does that mean? If you are taking away the most able kids from the comprehensive system, youre creating by another name secondary moderns. You can call it what you like. You can call it a technical school, a creative school, a red-white-and-blue school, but people will know that the most academic children are not going there. Those who do not make it to grammars will be regarded as second best at 11. Which great education system has selection at 11? I dont know any. May should, he says, not obsess about grammars but about capacity issues and attracting the best teachers, who can deliver the further essential systematic change that will be crucial now that Brexit has thrown up so many vast challenges. He is worried that exit from the EU will exacerbate teacher recruitment problems, as those from other EU countries leave. But more critical, he says, will be the need to develop vocational education in the system so the country produces young people with skills to replace immigrant workers. If youre going to make a success of Brexit, this should be the number one priority of government. Not grammar schools  Otherwise we wont have the skills. And the prospects for growth in the economy and productivity in the economy will suffer. Every multi-academy trust should run a university technology college for youngsters aged 14 to 19, he says. This will need leadership from someone at the top of government who can bang the heads of the CBI together, with headteachers, trade unions, to make it work. He adds: We need to say to youngsters, There are other paths than university. As he prepares to leave Ofsted, Wilshaw says his wife wants him to have a quieter life. But as he has done with successive education secretaries, and now the prime minister, he will resist. He wants to work with Baker on a new revolution  embedding vocational education into the school system. So, no to a quieter life? Im not that sort of personality. Ive been in education nearly half a century and I want to carry on doing stuff.",

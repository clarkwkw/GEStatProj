    "text": "&quot;I have icefire in my veins.&quot;  Anna Anthropy tells me this as we sit down for an interview at the Game Developers&apos; Conference in San Francisco. Such a declaration is not out of character for the prolific video game designer and author. Most of her games, such as Mighty Jill Off, Sex Cops of Tickle City, Encyclopaedia FuckMe and Lesbian Spider-Queens From Mars explore the intersection of sadism, gender and sex, subjects usually avoided by mainstream games. After I interview her, she will go to the Mad As Hell: Hothead Developers Rant Back session, where her fire-cleansing riffs on my poem Romero&apos;s Wives will leave me shaken and emotional and the Moscone Centre all but burnt down. And yet, Anna is not always the fierce dominatrix some people paint her: she is warm, loyal and supportive to those people she believes in. A transgender woman herself, she is quick to take the underdogs under her wing, be they queer, a woman, a person of colour - I have even seen her embrace the occasional bearded male indie game developer. Before she read my poem  a listing of the injustices against women in the games industry  to the crowds at GDC, she addressed me as her friend, and I have only met her in person twice. It&apos;s an honour to be accepted by someone I consider such a revolutionary mind. Anna&apos;s book The Rise of the Videogame Zinesters is a call to arms for people who have never tried to express themselves through the video game medium before. Part autobiographical and part information-disseminating, it takes the reader through various different ways to approach game making and game design, and encourages people to express their unique voice through games, just like Anna does in her work. Anna the provocateur looks at me with that wry twinkle in her eye. &quot;The reason I wrote that book is because I feel like video games need more voices and more people creating them. Video games are... very homogenous, and they are very alienating, and very hard to look at without... vomiting?&quot; She grins mischievously at me. &quot;And so I absolutely think that queer people and people of colour, and people who are outside the nerd status quo need to be involved in making games.&quot; Much of Anna&apos;s work has been done in the freeware versions of Game Maker and the html text adventure generator Twine. They have brought hope and power to those who have felt alienated or bored by the explosions, dudebros and gun violence of the triple A scene, encouraging diverse people to make games about themselves for themselves. I ask if the tools available for game making these days are helping her vision along, bringing more voices into the fold. &quot;Definitely. This last year since the book has been out, people have really adopted Twine, which is a free tool for making text games. And aside from being free, it&apos;s really not programming at all  if you can write a story, you can make a Twine game. A lot of people have been making all this weird amazing stuff. Someone made a Twine game, In Memoriam, for his dead brother. Someone made a Twine game about what it&apos;s like to come out as bi in a lesbian community and be re-closeted. Someone made a game about what it&apos;s like to sacrifice to the devil and receive a strange new pneumatic body with which you take over the world. Twine is this amazing queer and woman-orientated game-making community that didn&apos;t even exist a year ago.&quot; But are there strong artistic reasons for using Twine as a game making tool? Twine often has the author&apos;s voice come through very strongly because the working machinery of it is entirely constructed by one person and their words, whereas larger games such as the newly released Bioshock: Infinite have hundreds working on the game&apos;s thematic message to the player. &quot;The problem with games in general,&quot; Anna says, &quot;is that mainstream games are really depersonalised. They don&apos;t really tell us a lot about the human condition. I mean, they can tell us about a small slice of the human condition, which is shooting aliens in the face Or shooting other people in the face. But really I don&apos;t even in that area I feel like they don&apos;t really tell us that much. I think that what I want to see more of in games is the personal  games that speak to me as a human being, that are relatable, which is the opposite of the big publisher games that I see. People who are creating personal games aren&apos;t hundred-person teams, they are people working at home, making games with free software of their own experiences.&quot; Of note this year at GDC was one such person, Richard Hofmeier, who spent years developing his personal masterpiece Cart Life. This year Anna&apos;s autobiographical game about hormone therapy, Dys4ia, was nominated for the Independent Games Festival&apos;s &apos;Excellence in Narrative&apos; and &apos;Nuovo&apos; awards, though Cart Life ended up sweeping through the ceremony like a tidal wave. Afterwards, Hofmeier graffitied his own stand at the IGF Pavilion with &apos;Howling Dogs&apos;, the title of a critically lauded Twine text game from indiegam.es curator, Porpentine. He felt Howling Dogs hadn&apos;t received enough exposure. It was a punk rock act of community support, a rock and roll passing of the guitar, a call for indie to help indie. People could play Howling Dogs at the Cart Life stand for the rest of GDC. Money is a big issue when it comes to developing games. Anna sees Twine as part of redressing a balance that was tipping towards expensive software only available to large companies. &quot;It&apos;s a big deal that Twine is free,&quot; she deliberates, slowing down slightly. &quot;Any obstacle, however small, to making games will put off a lot of people. If you look at something like Game Maker, which is another tool for making games, that tool now costs a hundred bucks. And in the past there have always been free versions available, and the new free version of that puts a watermark on every game made unless you pay the hundred dollars.  &quot;And I guess that&apos;s so sad, that they&apos;ve taken what could have been a life-changing tool for a lot of people, and denied them access to it. Gatekeeping is a big problem. On one hand we have a game industry where budgets for games are often in the millions and billions of dollars, which essentially guarantees that marketers have the last say over everything that is allowed. On the other hand, we have people who are making free games on their own time, but who are barred access from basic means of getting things out there because they simply can&apos;t afford to. I mean I wouldn&apos;t have been in the IGF this year if a friend hadn&apos;t been able to pay the $95 for me. Because I simply can&apos;t afford to spend $95 on a gamble.&quot; Merritt Kopas, a writer and Twine developer, joins us briefly. &quot;For most of my adult life I had assumed that first of all there were no games being made by individual people, and specifically that there were no games being made by queer people for queer people. So finding out that that was something people could do and were doing was incredibly exciting. I suddenly saw a space for myself to do a thing that I&apos;d wanted to since I was a kid. Someone can just make a game like they would make a poem or a sketch A game that&apos;s a sketch. That&apos;s really powerful.&quot; Are Anna and Merritt planning to collaborate, I ask? They burst into laughter. &quot;We&apos;re dating!&quot; Anna says. &quot;So I guess sort of&quot; My final question is one of culpability. I ask Anna if she feels responsible for the so-called &apos;Twine Revolution&apos;, for how popular it has become? She smiles. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be a leader. I&apos;d rather have a movement in which everyone is the leader. Somehow I have ended up being a really visible representation of some marginalised people in games. But I would really, really love to not have to be the most visible person for those groups in games. This GDC feels really tremendously different Because I don&apos;t feel like I really am the only one. Watching Porpentine speak was really incredible.&quot; Though Anna seems reluctant to take the mantle of protagonist in this sense, it seems that her most important role in the games industry is her belief in community, auteurship, and her selfless support for marginalised perspectives. With her help, the games industry can look forward to a whole host of exciting new voices to embrace in future. Anna&apos;s new work, Star Wench  a choose your own adventure book about various spectacular ways to die  has just been released. You can find out about her other games here. Merritt has a website full of Twine games and musings, and Porpentine&apos;s Twine games can be found here.",

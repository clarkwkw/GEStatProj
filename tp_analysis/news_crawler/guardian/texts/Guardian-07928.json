    "text": "And so Gamescom is over. The European video game behemoth, which sits at the other side of the summer from E3, saw 275,000 visitors shuffle through its vast halls and its comparitively civilised business area, grabbing hands on time with the treats hinted at in Los Angeles in June.  With Nintendo and Microsoft both absent, Sony seemed to take control of the event, introducing five original new titles at its press conference and delighting many tired games journalists with its fin de sicle creativity and enthusiasm. The free-to-play MMO makers were out in force too, asserting their growing claims on the industry, while reliable old guns like Assassin&apos;s Creed, Fifa and Call of Duty did their best to shout above the cacophony.  So who won? Who surprised us? And what general themes can we draw from gaming&apos;s biggest show? I put this question to four veteran games writers: Pat Garratt, founder of the ceaslessly prolific news site, VG247; freelancer Dan Griliopoulos (PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun); Nathan Ditum, blogger and producer of PlayStation Access TV; and Chris Dring, associate editor at trade publication, MCV. Here&apos;s what they had to say: So, a nice easy one to start with: what were your favourite games of the show?Nathan Ditum: I&apos;ve got two. Epic Mickey: The Power Of Two uses Disney&apos;s massive archive of brilliant and often forgotten characters in a way that fascinates me as a Hollywood nerd, and Warren Spector&apos;s such an interesting guy. My other favourite was Rain, a small PlayStation exclusive from Sony&apos;s Japan Studio that looks arty and sad and other things I&apos;m a total sucker for. Dan Griliopoulos: For me it was X-com. Just a loving tribute to one of the best strategy games of all time. The multiplayer promises endless variation, whilst the single player will have a compelling detect-shoot down-fight-loot-research-manufacture-equip loop. Far Cry 3 came a close second, then Sim City, and Impire.  Pat Garratt: Far Cry 3 was the best thing I saw. It&apos;s an open-world gun game based on a fight-for-survival story on a Lost-style desert island. It&apos;s completely stupid. I&apos;m drawn to its drugs and bear attacks. Crucially, you can fist-fight a shark, which clearly makes it the most anticipated game of 2012. It&apos;s out at the beginning of December. Chris Dring: Call of Duty: Black Ops II. After all the talk of new things, what I loved the most was something that everyone apparently is really bored of. The new multiplayer, although still very Call of Duty, has been given more than just a face lift and introduces another new level of strategy. I also really love the look of Hitman&apos;s Contracts mode. It is so good, Square Enix even threw a press conference to announce it. Keith Stuart: I&apos;m going for Dishonored, which is complex and compelling and seemingly  shock, horror  very intelligent. But like Nathan, I&apos;m also interested in Rain by Sony&apos;s Japan studio, which reminds me very much of Konami&apos;s Lost in Shadow. I also enjoyed DmC, but then I love Ninja Theory games  they have a very different understanding of third-person combat than, say, Rocksteady, but it is very compelling.  And what were the biggest surprises?DG: Lords of Football. Solid quality simulation of football management from a Sims/Theme Park POV. Makes interesting use of a town as a user interface. Surprised by it being any good at all. Other than that, Impire is an extremely good riff on the Dungeon Keeper theme. CD: The fact that Sony didn&apos;t show a new PS3, didn&apos;t cut the PlayStation Vita, and yet still romped home with a fantastic press conference was a surprise. Vita was all about the big brands pushing the format  and the wonderful Tearaway  while PS3 was all about new IP, most of which just looked fantastic. Not entirely sure the new PS3 games are system shifters, but they looked the sort of games us journalists will pick up on day one. ND: I was surpised by just how much I hated Army Of Two: The Devil&apos;s Cartel, without even playing it. The dumber than rocks trailer was enough. KS: It was actually okay fun to play, though still doesn&apos;t do enough with the co-op mechanic. I want to see crazy, idiotic synchronised stunts. My biggest surprise was Sony  five new IPs! The best quote I read about it was that Sony just won E3: two months late... Anyway, Pat? PG: The biggest surprise of Gamescom 2012 for me was the German public&apos;s capacity for being fed into a human sausage machine in the name of seeing some computer games. Around 250,000 people turned up this year. I was only there for one of the public days, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve ever seen so many people inside a single building. I couldn&apos;t play anything. Apparently the queue to see a ten-minute demo of Crysis 3 was over three hours long. It was honestly frightening.  The organisers were forced to stop entry on one of the weekend days last year because the Messe was dangerously full, and it&apos;s obvious the overall experience for paying customers is diminished by the sheer scale of the show. It&apos;s pretty depressing to see young kids and parents standing completely bewildered in a hall the size of an aircraft hangar while thousands of teenagers bay for free T-shirts. So, the greatest surprise of the show for me is that fact that some of these people even bother. Finally, the big one: what do you think were the key themes of Gamescom 2012?CD: Free, free, free. It was all about games that cost nothing. Nintendo and Microsoft&apos;s stands were replaced by Wargaming and Trion Worlds and Gameforge. And these companies are all building or publishing free-to-play titles that compare with your big triple-A boxed games. EA announced a new free-to-play Command and Conquer, The Old Republic was there, Ubisoft unveiled three free-to-play companies. And of course, Dust 514 was there. The industry is changing, and although this can be scary to those of us used to the way the games industry has operated for the past 20 years, there&apos;s no denying it&apos;s all a bit exciting, too. In our traditional market, new IP was the order of the day. Are consumers bored? Well, the media certainly appeared to be, with much of the press praising the likes of Capcom and Sony for daring to do new things. Remember Me looked great, Tearaway was wonderful, as was the Sony Japan IP. You never know, daring to launch new IP might do something unspeakable and actually extend the life of these consoles even further. DG: The paid MMO is dead. No-one&apos;s doing it. The developers who have MMOs in development now tend to say they haven&apos;t decided what the business model is  by which they mean, what flavour of free they&apos;re going for. There&apos;s still a lot of room for price experimentation in both the mobile and MMO space, and someone&apos;s going to find a model that&apos;s not just not-intrusive but compelling and also a fun way to pay.  Lots of developers are still confused about their route to market. Lots of them have instinctively crass tastes, and the increasing preponderance of booth babes at GamesCom is hardly redressing the public&apos;s negative impression of computer games. Making an analogy to politics, developers need to lead the public, like the Indie developers do on Kongregate, iOS and Steam, not follow like the marketing bods do at GamesCom.  PG: To my mind, gamescom 2012 had three main themes. First, there was Vita&apos;s viability. Sony needed to show there was a future for the machine. Shuhei Yoshida, PlayStation&apos;s development boss, told me it was key he proved there were enough games in the works for Vita to make near-term ownership worthwhile. As such, we saw reveals of some major new first-party Vita projects  Media Molecule&apos;s Tearaway, a fresh Killzone game and others  and got an exciting Sony press conference. There was a great deal of positivity surrounding Sony and Vita this year, and that&apos;s good for everyone. Secondly, we had the show&apos;s unavoidable elephant: the next console generation. The main publishers announced no new product, giving us nothing more then fresh-ish demos of E3 software. Development&apos;s being pushed wholesale onto next-gen hardware, so there&apos;s a huge amount going on behind the scenes that we&apos;re not going to see until next year. It made the whole thing a bit stale in terms of blockbusters. Gamescom 2013 will be a very different show, as it&apos;s likely the next Xbox and PlayStation will be announced at E3 in Los Angeles next June. Lastly, there was the free-to-play model. Some business journalists were saying they rarely had a meeting about anything else, and it was predicted in the show&apos;s main opening ceremony that &quot;F2P&quot; would be the dominant method of consuming games within a matter of years. Some of the biggest crowds in the consumer halls were for games which are free to download and are then monetised through micro-transactions, as opposed to being bought for 50 on a disc. It&apos;s very likely this is going to be the future of games in general, and we were seeing the entire subject emerge as a strong theme at gamescom this year. ND: From a console perspective the biggest story is about what&apos;s not here  next gen is clearly the driving force behind what the big three are doing, including Microsoft and Nintendo not coming because they&apos;re not ready to (or in Nintendo&apos;s case, bothered about) showing anything new. Next gen loomed large in Sony&apos;s conference as well, despite not actually being there  with Move, Wonderbook and bright, younger-skewing new IP, PlayStation 3 is going kid-friendly for a final profit-squeeze before the end of the cycle, while The Last Of Us looks likely to be its last big hardcore hurrah. KS: I think on balance then, there&apos;s an interesting asynchronous war brewing between the traditional console manufacturers and their old business model, and the emerging free-to-play giants and their platform agnostic mega-brands. If this show really was about the calm before the next generation storm, that coming generation of consoles had better learn from the likes of Trion Worlds and Gameforge. Adaptable delivery and pricing structures are going to be vital. Also, people seem to really like and respond to orginal new titles at these events... whoever saw that coming?",

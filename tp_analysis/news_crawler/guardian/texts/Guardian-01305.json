    "text": "Brooding psychological horror adventure Alan Wake is coming to PC. Swedish publisher Nordic Games has bought the platform rights to the title, and is launching it on Steam on 16 February with other digital download platforms to follow.  Developed by Max Payne creator Remedy Entertainment and originally released on the Xbox 360 in 2010, the game follows the eponymous author as he arrives in a remote Washington village to get over a vicious bout of writer&apos;s block. However, it soon becomes clear that the town is under the influence of an evil presence and Wake must fight to save himself and his wife from the encroaching darkess.  The title was a critical success on its original release and gained a stong cult following. While initial sales were modest, a successful digital release for the game on Xbox has earned it a larger audience. The new PC version has been enhanced in key areas, with higher resolution visuals, mouse and keyboard support, the ability to hide the HUD and compatability with the AMD Eyefinity and Nvidia Nvision 3D modes.  &quot;We&apos;ve done our best to do justice to the PC version and do things the way they should be done for PC,&quot; said Markus Mki, CTO at Remedy. &quot;The PC version looks absolutely beautiful. We&apos;re bringing the game to life in a whole new way.&quot; And this isn&apos;t the only good news for Wake fans. The Xbox Live Arcade spin-off, Alan Wake&apos;s American Nightmare, will be launched on 15 February. This side-story to the original game sees the character seemingly stuck in one of his earlier crime scripts.",

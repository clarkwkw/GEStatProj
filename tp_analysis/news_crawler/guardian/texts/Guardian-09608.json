    "headline": "Plantwatch: Hopes of autumn conker battles fade after pest damage to trees", 
    "text": "The leaves on trees are changing colour  splashes of yellow on sycamore and birch trees, hawthorns have patches of purple and red on them and wild cherry trees have turned beautiful purples and scarlet. This sodden autumn has been great news for fungi, with plenty of plump mushrooms and toadstools. But it is a myth that poisonous mushrooms are all coloured or stain when cut; anyone unsure about telling an edible field mushroom from a poisonous death cap, for example, should leave them well alone. Conkers have been in a sorry state this year, much smaller than usual. The culprit is a pest, the caterpillars of the leaf miner moth, which chew through the leaves. The moth is also doing huge damage to the horse chestnut trees themselves, leaving them short of food and shedding their leaves early. The moth originally came from Macedonia and was first recorded here in Wimbledon, south-west London, in 2002, and has been spreading through England ever since. It is now reaching into Wales. Ironically, conkers were once used to keep the clothes moth away from wardrobes. And conkers kept in the corner of a room are also reputed to keep spiders away. In the first world war, a shortage of acetone for making cordite for munitions led to using conkers as the raw material for producing acetone. Vast quantities of conkers were collected, mostly by schoolchildren, although their end-use was kept a top secret. However, the conkers proved to be poor substitutes for making acetone.",

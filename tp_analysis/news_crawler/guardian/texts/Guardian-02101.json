    "text": "The old town of Crewkerne on Somerset&apos;s southern boundary lies on our customary route to the Dorset coast around Lyme Bay, so we tend to pass through without paying the town&apos;s buildings and character the careful attention that they deserve. It was a leaflet, entitled Bincombe Beeches  nature trail, that gave us reason to stop there this time and find our way up Bincombe Hill, where the wind was whistling in the treetops. We soon found shelter between the hedges and ferny banks of a sunken lane, and admired the knotted and gnarled base of an ancient, ivy-clad tree surrounded by sandy humps and hollows and the entrances to a badger sett. There has been coppicing of alder in the wood, and a programme of re-planting aims to replace the beeches that are approaching the end of their lifespan. 0ccasionally we had a partial view through a screen of the young, tall and slender trees, across the top of the town in its valley. Soon we came to a superb colonnade of lofty, mature beeches on the bank to the left of our path. On the right, a fallen elm was host to a rich and varied growth of fungi, while above us seagulls wheeled and screeched, a reminder that the coast is not far away.Underfoot there was a mat of beech nuts, and dry beech leaves were blown in the wind. When we came out of the wood to a sloping grass clearing, the southward views, even on a winter day, were remarkable. Below us was the town&apos;s complex geometry of roofs, gables and alleys  elegant Jacobean and Georgian houses, the grammar school where Nelson&apos;s captain, Hardy, was educated, and factories that made sailcloth. And rising above them all, on the far side, the magnificent tower, pinnacles and battlements of the perpendicular church of St Bartholomew&apos;s, with a backdrop of wooded hills beyond.",

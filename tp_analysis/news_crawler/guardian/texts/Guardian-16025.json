Xbox One must go online every day, will play used games | VG247  In a series of Xbox Wire posts, Microsoft has put paid to various misconceptions about the Xbox One  and confirmed other details. The first of these is that the console will need to go online every single day if you want to keep gaming. Microsoft justified this decision by pointing out the many advantages of a networked console, and said it is preparing for a &quot;connected future&quot;. &quot;While a persistent connection is not required, Xbox One is designed to verify if system, application or game updates are needed and to see if you have acquired new games, or resold, traded in, or given your game to a friend. Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud may require a connection,&quot; the platform holder said.  Just to be clear this means that, if you go offline after authenticating your system, you have 24 hours of play before the console presumably stops your game and asks to be reconnected to the internet. This is either a DRM measure or a means of transferring from a system in which consumers &apos;own&apos; games into one in which they effectively lease them. Whatever, the forums are up in arms, and game sites are reacting with anger  see Tom Bramwell&apos;s blistering tirade on Eurogamer. Microsoft is going to have to do a lot of damage control at E3... Titanfall from Respawn coming to PC, Xbox One, Xbox 360 | VG247  Brought to the Internet&apos;s attention by a NeoGAF user, Titanfall is slated for PC and Xbox One, with an Xbox 360 version &quot;being developed by someone else,&quot;  this last bit was rumored back in April. According to bits from the article, the FPS isn&apos;t coming to PlayStation platforms due to the small team at the studio, and it and wanted to focus on creating &quot;the best possible product.&quot;  The title will apparently use the cloud for certain AI and physics calculations  this is something Microsoft engineers hinted would happen with a lot of games on the new console. Respawn are also promising to blur the lines between single- and multiplayer gaming... Capcom Teases &apos;Big Surprise&apos; at E3 | IGN  Capcom is teasing a surprise at E3 next week.

Diablo III arriving on PS3 AND Xbox 360 on September 3rd | MCV  Blizzard&apos;s console port of its hit PC dungeon crawler Diablo III has finally been dated. The game will be released on PS3 on September 3rd. The surprise move is that it will also hit Xbox 360 on the same day.  There are big design and content updates, according to Blizzard, and smartly, there is four-player co-op, both online and local  for that authentic Gauntlet feel. Kiefer Sutherland Playing Snake in Metal Gear Solid V | IGN  In its pre-E3 conference today, Konami revealed that Kiefer Sutherland will play Snake in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. &quot;I wanted Snake to have a more subdued performance expressed through subtle facial movements and tone of voice rather than words,&quot; Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima said. &quot;Furthermore, the game takes place in 1984 when Snake is 49 years old. Therefore, we needed someone who could genuinely convey both the facial and vocal qualities of a man in his late 40s. It&apos;s different from anything we&apos;ve done before.&quot;  David Hayter, a man genuinely in his 40s, isn&apos;t happy. Yesterday he tweeted, &quot;Can&apos;t fault @RealKiefer Great actor, good man. The game will probably still be excellent. Like New Coke!&quot; Miaowwww! You can follow Press Start at Pinboard.",

    "text": "Student digs. They don&apos;t have a great reputation, do they? But hovel or hall, private rental or student squat, for anyone who&apos;s not already signed on the dotted line, putting a roof over your head in time for the start of term is likely to be a pressing worry. Accommodation can take a massive slice out of your student maintenance loan - every penny and more in some places. So why are rents so astronomical, and what can students expect for their money? This Wednesday, from 1-3pm we&apos;ll be hosting a live webchat with a legal adviser, a student welfare officer and the group strategy director of Unite, a private student accommodation provider. If there&apos;s anything that baffles or enrages you about student living, now is the time to ask. Perhaps you want advice on your rights as a tenant. How do you negotiate the best deal when signing a contract? If you&apos;re not getting value for money from your landlord, what redress do you have? Are &quot;bills inclusive&quot; contracts a rip-off? And... what about the mice? (That last one is  we hope  a joke). Leave your questions in advance by posting them in the comments section below. The panel John Gallagher is principal solicitor at Shelter, a homelessness charity that runs a housing helpline and works with local citizens advice bureaux Paul Harris is group strategy director at Unite, a private student housing provider. Unite develops and manages student accommodation in 24 cities Chloe Merna is a student adviser employed by Manchester University Students Union. She deals with accommodation problems, ranging from how to get your deposit back to what to do if you fall out with your flatmates",

Canon EOS 7D 1/400sec, f/4.0, 420 mm, iso:800    Question: This South American mystery bird is placed into a large and confusing group of birds that is currently being examined closely using DNA studies. Why are these birds so confusing? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is an adult male purplish-mantled tanager, Iridosornis porphyrocephalus, one of several hundred passerine species that are placed into the neotropical tanager family, Thraupidae.  Since there is no group of characters that all tanagers possess, the thraupids are a wide variety of small- to medium-sized songbirds that appear to have been thrown together into one family. Phylogenetic studies have resulted in a number of species being shifted around, and those taxa that are currently thought to be true tanagers form three main groups: the dull-coloured tanagers, the brightly-coloured tanagers and the saltators. Which of these three groups that our mystery bird belongs to is left as a mental exercise for the reader.  Why is this group of birds so confusing and confused? In a phrase: convergent evolution combined with rapid evolutionary radiation. Mystery bird commenter, icancho, explains:  ... the whole lineage has radiated (almost entirely within S. America) into ways of life occupied by other lineages of bird elsewhere, in more familiar places. Thus quite a lot of the species now recognised as members of this family (via DNA work) used to be allocated to some other families by virtue of their morphology. Likewise, this family has lost some species to other families. A great deal of this has had to do with whether the species have evolved the form of seed-eaters or of fruit-eaters.

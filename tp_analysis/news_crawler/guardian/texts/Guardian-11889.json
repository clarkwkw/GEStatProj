    "text": "Google has completed a 1bn property deal to move its UK headquarters to a brownfield site in London&apos;s King&apos;s Cross area. The US technology giant has purchased a 2.4 acre site between King&apos;s Cross and St Pancras stations and plans to build a seven and 11 storey complex due to be complete in 2016. Google already has two central London offices  one in Victoria and one on St Giles High Street  from where staff are expected to be relocated. The move forms part of the regeneration of the King&apos;s Cross area following the opening of the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras in 2007. Organisations that have moved into the area since then include Guardian News &amp; Media, publisher of MediaGuardian, and art college Central St Martin&apos;s. Google&apos;s purchase mirrors its property strategy in Dublin, where it bought a building outright for 2,000 staff in 2011.

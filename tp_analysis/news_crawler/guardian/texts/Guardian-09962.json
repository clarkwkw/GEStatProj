    "text": "Reborn in 2010 in an attempt to wrest control of the first-person-shooter genre from Activision, EA&apos;s Medal of Honor series is pitched as the authentic alternative to Call of Duty&apos;s Hollywood bombast. Yet, while Warfighter&apos;s violence is informed by real-life US Tier One special forces operators, it does not translate into compelling gameplay. The mercifully short campaign tells a muddled, incoherent tale of global terrorism, complete with gratuitous flag-waving and overstated reverence for the military. Developer Danger Close relies on narrow, linear battlefields to frame its action and it&apos;s hard to escape the feeling of claustrophobia, being ushered through camouflaged corridors from one scripted set-piece to the next while the only new idea  a door-breaching mini-game that rewards the player with unlocks  is both underdeveloped and overused. None of which is helped by a variety of AI and scripting bugs that conspire to sap all enjoyment from the campaign. Thankfully, multiplayer fares a little better. A new buddy system encourages teamwork and strategy, while classes, perks and unlocks offer the now obligatory sense of progression. But although the combat feels smoother online, poor visuals and bland map design sour the experience. When compared to the slick, refined content of its main competitors, on this evidence it seems unlikely the Medal of Honor series will survive without a major rethink. ",

    "text": "The idea of your smartphone as a provider of recommendations places, media, people etc  is well established now. But the question of where those recommendations come from remains an interesting debate. Including if you swap where for who. Two mobile apps with different approaches to personal recommendations have made me think about the subject in recent months: Thumb and LoveThis.  Developed on either side of the Atlantic, they both aim to provide recommendations and opinions, but while the crowd being tapped for real-time wisdom is strangers for Thumb, it&apos;s friends for LoveThis. Thumb encourages its users to &quot;ask questions, get and give opinions, start a conversation&quot; with the aim of getting &quot;fast, fun opinions from other folks just like you&quot;. That usually involves posting a question, accompanied by a photo, and waiting for responses from other Thumb users, who can give a thumbs-up, thumbs-down or neutral response, with an optional comment. The app surprises with the volume of responses while writing this piece I posted a question about whether a stand-up desk would make me healthier, and received 40 responses within a few minutes (60% thumbs-down, if you&apos;re wondering). This at lunchtime UK-time, before most of the US had woken up. Thumb sprang from a mobile Q&amp;A app called Opinionaided, which rebranded in December 2011. When I spoke to chief executive Dan Kurani, he told me that &quot;questions are a natural stimulant for conversation: people connect very powerfully around opinions&quot;. He also said that Thumb took a deliberate decision not to &quot;force people to include their existing social group&quot; when signing up to the app. &quot;We won&apos;t just dump everybody from your contact list in there&quot;. The result, in theory, are responses that are purely based on the question and photo posted, rather than prior knowledge of the poster. Which may mean more brutal (but useful) honesty for questions like &quot;Do these clothes look good on me?&quot;. LoveThis takes a different angle. Developed in the UK, it aims to be &quot;the best way to swap recommendations with friends&quot;, with users encouraged to post their thoughts on books, pubs, music and a host of other products for their friends to see and comment on. Founder Alexis Dormandy told me that he&apos;s betting on people&apos;s trust in their friends when it comes to recommendations. &quot;When you&apos;re deciding whether to visit a restaurant or hotel, there&apos;s research showing you need 17 anonymous reviews [to be convinced] but only 1.2 recommendations from friends,&quot; he said. &quot;I genuinely believe your life will be more fun if you have your 30 friends&apos; best books, hotels, children&apos;s toys... you name it.&quot; Thumb and LoveThis isn&apos;t a straight either/or comparison: questions versus recommendations. Neither is Thumb just about strangers: in fact, Kurani said that over time, he sees people building new connections based on their opinions strangers becoming friends.",

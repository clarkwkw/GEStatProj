    "text": "&apos;Hello Sweetie! Why do our dates always end in the destruction of the universe? By this time of year, we would ordinarily be well into a new series of Doctor Who. But thanks to the BBC&apos;s wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey scheduling of the show lately, we&apos;re being kept waiting until autumn for the final days of the Ponds. So with the arrival of The Eternity Clock, a side-scrolling platform puzzler for PS3 and Vita, we&apos;re as excited about the year&apos;s first new Doctor Who as we are apprehensive about the historically lousy quality of Timelord-related gaming thus far. A time-storm surrounds the Earth, and the Doctor and River Song must travel across time to stop it. The go in search of something called the Eternity Clock, a planet that is a record of everything that has or will ever happen in all of existence. With Amy and Rory off-screen and not mentioned, we must assume this takes place somewhere between last year&apos;s finale and Christmas special. Or it could be in one of the incremental gaps we&apos;re told will separate the first block of this year&apos;s episodes, which will lead to their exit. It&apos;s a shame not to see the Ponds, but with them on their way out and the game purportedly the first in a trilogy, that&apos;s hardly surprising. In any case, there are few sights that make me smile as much as the sight of Doctor Song breaking out of her Stormcage Containment prison facility by smooching guards with her hallucinogenic lipstick. That, from the outset, is one of the things that the game gets right. And rather wonderfully, both Matt Smith and Alex Kingston have shot motion-capture sequences and extensive voice work to give this the feel of a proper canonical Doctor Who story. The writing and the delivery is as good as you&apos;d expect, and seeing them both skirt between Elizabethan, Victorian, present-day and far future eras, facing off against (some beautifully rendered) Daleks, Cybermen, Silurians and Silence goes some way to providing the kind of expansive, psychedelic mash-up story that gaming could afford Doctor Who. If only that were not the end of the good news ... &apos;This storm is tearing time to pieces in here. I don&apos;t know how much longer we can take it!&apos;     Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock    Unfortunately, any sustained period of time spent actually playing The Eternity Clock will leave you with a similarly desperate feeling. Doctor Who games have always set very specific problems. The Doctor&apos;s MO is that he never uses violence, which is all very well in a TV drama, but leaving a game dependent on stealth and puzzles and keeping it pacey enough to actually feel like Doctor Who. Having the less-Pacifist River onside means enemies can at least be stunned, and she can disable guards with her lipstick. Equally, developer Supermassive has come up with a novel way of being able to kill our hero without him regenerating  the Eternity Clock just resets time. And unlike the dire Nintendo effort of two years ago, Back To Earth, the 2D side-scrolling format provides a fathomable way in to non-gamers who just want to explore the world of Who. But it&apos;s so unweidly, laborious, repetitive, as well as being often fiendishly and unfairly difficult that it&apos;s difficult to imagine anybody sticking with it for very long with any less incentive than the actual destruction of the universe. It&apos;s a shame, because there&apos;s still a great Doctor Who tie-in destined to get made in the mists of time. This is one step closer, but certainly not it. Mysteries and Questions Aside from the question of &quot;when will somebody finally make the game that Doctor Who deserves?&quot; there&apos;s little here to advance any particular ongoing story. Or is there? Part of the unlockable content in the game lets you find pages of River&apos;s diary. Could some still-to-come TV plot-points be hidden within them? Nevertheless, I&apos;m hoping to meet the fabled Jim The Fish. Time-Space Debris You can also unlock the Doctor&apos;s collection of hats, over and above the fez and the stetson the Doctor was so cruelly shot off his head by fashion-forward River. Yet pointlessly, you can&apos;t actually wear them. Just like on the revived TV show, the Cybermen provide a weak link. One of the most ludicrously frustrating sequences sees a vaguely-described puzzle force you to wait several long minutes for them to stomp up some stairs and smash a window. And then likely have to do it all over again. Could there be a way to satisfactorily incorporate the Silences&apos; biggest sell, which is their memory-proofing? Now that would be cool. All that prison food probably means River hasn&apos;t been eating properly. Her avatar is virtually emaciated. Still, let us at least be grateful that this is not Back To Earth for Wii. Doctor Who returns to TV this autumn. And not a moment too soon!",

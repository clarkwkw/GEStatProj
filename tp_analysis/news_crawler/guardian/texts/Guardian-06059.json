The Surface tablet represents an indictment of the entire PC and device industry, which has stood by for a couple of years trying to mimic Apple with a parade of hapless, copycat products.  Rather than complaining, PC makers ought to take note of what Microsoft has produced.  BlackBerry 10 hands-on (video) &gt;&gt; Engadget  RIM&apos;s principal architect, Gary Klassen, was kind of enough to furnish us with two devices running BB 10 and walk us through a short, intimate demo. To say that the OS we saw was anything but final would be a gross understatement. So far, the three key features the company&apos;s been confident enough to make public - camera, keyboard and app switching - are only mere elements of the still in-development UI and, as such, can&apos;t truly be relied upon to paint a complete picture of what the finalized end-user experience will be.   Excited now? Mark Zuckerberg Is worth more than Nokia &gt;&gt; Wired With graphs. Scary. (He&apos;s also worth more than RIM.) Microsoft Surface just made the MacBook Air and the iPad look obsolete &gt;&gt; Gizmodo  After yesterday&apos;s Surface event -- assuming they don&apos;t fumble the execution -- Gates&apos; children may have found the weapon to stop the heirs of Jobs and turn the tide. Or at least make things exciting for everyone again.  That weapon is Microsoft Surface. And it is beautiful. Beautiful and functional and simple and honest. Surface just bumped the MacBook Air and the iPad to the back seat, and it did so by hewing tightly to everything that Apple&apos;s Jonny Ive holds dear, according to the Ten Principles of his Jedi design master, Dieter Rams.  Want to disable Facebook facial recognition? Read this &gt;&gt; Naked Security  Many people feel distinctly uncomfortable about a site like Facebook learning what they look like, and using that information without their explicit permission. Although Facebook&apos;s motivation may currently be to interconnect more of its users, and make photo tagging a more seamless process, the idea of there being a database built of 900 million people&apos;s faces, with knowledge of who and what they like, and their personal relationships and conversations, puts a chill down the spine of privacy advocates.   You too can be chilled; read on. Google+ chief: &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve hit hyper growth yet&quot; &gt;&gt; FT Tech blog  &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve hit that hyper growth phase,&quot; [Google vp Brad Horowitz] said, while pointing out that Google+ had still managed to reach the scale it had faster than many social networks.  &quot;While I&apos;m stunned at the growth... I do think our best days our ahead of us. A lot of the things I know we are yet to launch will make dramatic difference in usage.&quot;  Google said in April that 100m of those 170m users logged in during the last month but Mr Horowitz gave little further information about how active its users really are today.  The evolution of the computing value chain &gt;&gt; asymco  The history of personal computing has come to be defined as the history of Microsoft. At least since 1981 Microsoft&apos;s operating systems have been the consistent market share leaders, and by a very large margin. That is about to change. This year Android will be on more devices sold than Windows. iOS is also set to also overtake Windows next year.  You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

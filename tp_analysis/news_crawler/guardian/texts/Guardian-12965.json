    "text": "Spinning off from the PS3 and 360&apos;s Lords of Shadow  which established a new storyline distinct from the classic Castlevania series  Mirror of Fate continues the Belmont family&apos;s eternal battle against the arch-vampire Alucard. However, in adopting a 2D side-scrolling approach to its action-platform gameplay, it feels closer to Konami&apos;s earliest games, and that&apos;s no bad thing. Gameplay also feels like a call back to the series&apos; roots, a bouncy mix of dodging, guarding and counterattacking using the now iconic whip-chain, with increasingly deadly special moves and weapons to unlock as you level up. Focusing on the lives of three generations of the Belmont clan, Mirror of Fates&apos;s tale is of ambitious scope, touching on themes of obligation, destiny and damnation. Key story moments are told through gorgeous cel-shaded cutscenes  think the comic-book visuals of Borderlands with a gothic twist. It&apos;s easily one of the finest looking games on the 3DS, with striking locations in and around the gargantuan castle you&apos;ll be exploring. The actual 3D effects work rather well too, though become distracting during boss fights. As a nice corollary to the release of Mirror of Fates, the first Castlevania has also arrived on the 3DS eShop (4.49, download only). Both titles provide a satisfying challenge but the original willfeel brutally difficult to players usedto more versatile controls.",

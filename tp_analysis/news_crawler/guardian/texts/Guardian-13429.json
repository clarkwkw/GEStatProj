    "text": "   Pauline Kamau Photograph: J Rand/Pauline Kamau    There has been no progress in prosecuting the perpetrators of violence against women in Kenya [during the 2007-08 post-election disorder]. However, community awareness-raising by civil society groups and religious leaders on violence against women and all gender-based violence has been ongoing. Peace initiatives by the same  and including the government and communities themselves  have been joining together to preach peace. Inter-community tours and dialogues have happened, facilitated by the government and members of parliament. African leaders should be the ones in the forefront, preaching peace and urging the people to live harmoniously. The leaders, especially the parliamentarians, make laws  there must be laws that protect women from sexual violence that are implemented. The judiciary should prosecute those who perpetrate violence. There are numerous grassroots movements that are educating women on their rights to change the culture of violence. However, these movements must engage the perpetrators of violence, and use them in raising awareness of the vice. Without the involvement of the perpetrators, gender violence cannot be addressed. However, there are a few men-based organisations that are addressing patriarchy and women&apos;s rights  [this] has gone a long way in addressing women&apos;s rights and having the men buy into women&apos;s rights. The leaders are aware of women&apos;s rights  it is only that they do not &quot;walk the talk&quot;. The important thing in Kenya is to ensure laws that protect women are implemented. The 2010 Kenyan constitution clearly addresses the rights of women and inclusion of women in development as a crucial agenda. It states that all have equal rights, irrespective of their gender. Kenya&apos;s Vision 2030 development plan also addresses gender clearly and the importance of having the whole population in development without leaving out one gender. This means, therefore, that the problem in Kenya generally is the implementation of the laws, as the population hides in their culture when they are violating women&apos;s rights. Education on retrogressive culture should be done among men and women in the country.",

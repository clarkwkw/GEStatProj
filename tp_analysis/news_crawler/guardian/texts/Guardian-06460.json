    "text": "After creating the spectacular adventure-puzzle game Portal, designer Kim Swift is something of a rock star to keen gamers. However, much like the tortured musical genius who struggles with a follow-up album after a genre-redefining release, Swift&apos;s newest entry into the wider gaming oeuvre, the slightly underwhelming Quantum Conundrum, doesn&apos;t quite reach the lofty heights of its predecessor. Wandering around your scientist uncle&apos;s improbably large mansion, the challenge is to shift dimensions  adjusting the mass and weight of objects, or the flow of time  to solve puzzles that are equal parts ingenious and cruelly simple. However, many cross the line from challenging to outright frustrating in a way its spiritual predecessor never did. Despite possessing an abundance of charm, too much here feels like echoes of Portal. Yet gamers coming at it without expectations will enjoy an engaging and addictive game.",

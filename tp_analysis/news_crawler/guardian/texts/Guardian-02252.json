    "text": "You&apos;ve heard about the Windows 8 Consumer Preview, and you&apos;ve read the early reviews which say, for example, that while it&apos;s great on a touchscreen (such as a tablet), it&apos;s jarring on the desktop. But those all came from people who were techies.

Just as a reminder, here&apos;s that Start Me Up advert from 1995 (or watch it on YouTube:             (Thinks: what a great ad. Works just as well now.) And now here&apos;s Chris Pirillo&apos;s father trying Windows 8 Consumer Preview. Pirillo essentially leaves him to his own devices (literally) and challenges him to find his way around. (There&apos;s also an IM stream in the background of people who are watching what&apos;s going on. You can also watch it on YouTube.)

Keyboard/mouse + Windows 8: Hate!&quot;). (Updated to add links for mobile viewers.)",

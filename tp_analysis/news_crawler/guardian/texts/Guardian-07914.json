    "text": "If you didn&apos;t see our story last week, Gamesblog Live has teamed up with Disney Interactive for a very special event, taking place in London on Tuesday night. I&apos;ll be interviewing industry legend Warren Spector, the genius behind Deus Ex and the Epic Mickey titles. Spector is one of the most fascinating game designers on the planet, a tireless advocate of open-world creative gaming and a hugely compelling guy to listen to. Plus, attendees to this free event will get the chance to pose questions to Warren, as well as get hands-on time with Epic Mickey 2, which looks astonishing. The event takes place at Disney&apos;s headquarters room in Hammersmith. Tickets are FREE, but you need to email Rebecca Wharmby at Disney to register your interest!",

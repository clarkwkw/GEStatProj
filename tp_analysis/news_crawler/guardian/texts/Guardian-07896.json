    "text": "One of the government&apos;s flagship academy schools has lost a legal challenge over its refusal to admit a number of children with special educational needs. Parents have successfully challenged Mossbourne academy in Hackney, east London, in five legal cases, while a sixth has been adjourned. The cases include one in which the school refused to admit an 11-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, arguing that it would compromise other children&apos;s education and that it already has a higher-than-average number of pupils with special needs. While the 11-year-old is academically gifted  he already has an A* in GCSE maths  his condition can make him unsteady on his feet. It also affects his ability at practical tasks such as using a ruler. The Learning Trust, which manages education in Hackney, refused to name Mossbourne in the children&apos;s statements, the document setting out a child&apos;s needs and the help they should receive, including the name of the school they will attend. However, a tribunal has ruled that Mossbourne should be named in the statements of the three children, according to Ipsea, the special needs advice service. A fourth case was adjourned for more information, Ipsea said. A local authority can legally decline to name a school in a statement if the child&apos;s presence would have a negative impact on the education of existing pupils. This could mean reducing the level of pastoral care available to other children. Jane McConnell, Ipsea&apos;s chief executive, said: &quot;These parents have gone through an ordeal which should not have happened. Very good schools like Mossbourne should recognise and celebrate their success with such children, and we hope the children in these cases will be among Mossbourne&apos;s many success stories.&quot; According to Ipsea, the tribunal ruling established that parents can appeal over admissions decisions made by academies, even where the academy&apos;s funding agreement with the education secretary does not state that it will follow such a ruling. The tribunal applied the law relevant when a parent of a statemented child wants an independent school, Ipsea said. The Learning Trust had argued that, depending on the terms of an academy&apos;s funding agreement, it may not have to admit a child even if the school is named in the child&apos;s statement. Mossbourne has previously stated that nearly 1,600 children applied for 200 places in its September 2012 intake. Of those, 53 have statements. Of the 53, 28 named Mossbourne as their first preference. Nationally, 21% of schoolchildren have some form of special needs, but at Mossbourne the proportion in each year is 26%-28%. Mossbourne replaced Hackney Downs, a school described as the worst in Britain before it was closed down in 1995. It is noted for its traditional approach to teaching and learning, with streaming and a curriculum organised around subjects rather than themes.  This article was amended on 21 August 2012. The original said that parents have successfully challenged Mossbourne academy in three legal cases, while a fourth has been adjourned. This has been corrected.",

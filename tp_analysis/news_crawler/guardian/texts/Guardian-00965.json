[I will identify this bird for you in 48 hours] Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 18 December 2011 (with permission) [velociraptorize].Nikon D7000   This Chinese mystery bird has a special morphological adaptation that is shared with a group of parrots. What morphological adaptation is that? What ecological character do these two unrelated bird groups share such that they evolved this similar trait? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? About the Daily Mystery Bird:  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in 24 different time zones, and some people are following on their iPhones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours.2. If you know the bird&apos;s identity, provide subtle hints to let others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful as small clues to less experienced players. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones.4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too).2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all.4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.  If you have bird images, video or mp3 files that you&apos;d like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at The Guardian, feel free to contact me to learn more.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientistevil google+: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

    "text": "With Bulletstorm developer People Can Fly taking over the reins for GOW: Judgment, the attendant scrutiny has ensured the team was keen to leave its mark on Epic&apos;s flagship franchise. And they have done: the resulting prequel to the Gears trilogy (starring Baird and Cole) offers a new spin on the campaign mode and just enough multiplayer content to justify the price tag. Gone are the narrative histrionics and set pieces that have come to define the Gears campaign, replaced with something subtler. Judgment is divided into small, action-packed skirmishes with a distinctly arcade focus. Awarded stars at the end of each segment, the player must vary their combat style to achieve the highest ranking. Executions, headshots and gory finishes reap rewards and they can take on declassified sub-missions, which impose extra victory conditionssuchas weapon restrictions and time limits. Although this new arcade sensibility certainly shakes up the formula, the fragmented campaign is lacking in spectacle and surprisingly po-faced. A mini-campaign, Aftermath, fills in some story gaps in the trilogy but, strangely, ditches the star system and feels out of place with the developer&apos;s arcade vision. On the multiplayer front, the real highlight is the class-based Overrun, which requires a pleasing degree of teamwork and strategy, but some series fans may feel somewhat short-changed by the modest selection of maps and lack of Horde mode.",

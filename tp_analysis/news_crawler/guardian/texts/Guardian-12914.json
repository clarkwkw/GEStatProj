    "text": "An urban water supply project (pdf) in Darfur, funded by the British government, was poorly designed and had limited benefit for the people it was supposed to help, the UK aid watchdog said on Thursday. While acknowledging the tough environment and escalating humanitarian situation in Darfur, south-west Sudan, since fighting broke out in 2003, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) said the commercial interests of water suppliers and the high household cost of water were not sufficiently thought through when the Department for International Development (DfID) devised the project. A partnership between DfID and the NGO Tearfund that delivered water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) programmes in the region was, in contrast, more responsive to the needs of the community and produced good results since it began in 2007, the watchdog said. Rating the department&apos;s project amber-red, for its overall poor performance, Icai said: &quot;DfID needs to rethink its approach to engaging in chronic emergencies.&quot; A DfID spokesman branded the report &quot;outdated&quot;. &quot;The UK has already transformed our humanitarian response in Sudan to help address the root causes of conflict rather than simply relying on emergency aid and it is disappointing not to see this reflected in Icai&apos;s report.&quot; DfID is the largest donor to the UN-led Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), set up in 2006 to better manage international humanitarian assistance following perceived failures in Darfur. DfID&apos;s support to Sudan has been mainly humanitarian. During the 1990s the department channelled small amounts of money through Operation Lifeline Sudan, but it increased its response significantly after violence in 2003. Funding reached a peak of 97.8m in 2005-06, making the UK the third-largest donor after the US and EU. Icai said DfID&apos;s early 36m Wash programmes had helped save lives, by reducing waterborne diseases. But the department had not adapted its projects to accommodate a protracted peace process, which meant its work has &quot;led to dependency and is not providing sustainable solutions&quot;. In an attempt to address the problem, in 2007 DfID launched the 6.7m Darfur Water Supply project, which was delivered by the UN Office for Project Services and sought to supply four towns in Darfur and increase their resilience to drought. Icai said this was a &quot;positive and timely initiative, intended to address the environmental impact of urbanisation and the consequences of long-term humanitarian assistance on the non-IDP [internally displaced people] urban poor&quot;, but it &quot;neglected the political and institutional challenges involved in improving urban water supply&quot;. The project was not based on an analysis of the commercial interests involved in water delivery in the region, said the report, and DfID&apos;s subsequent efforts to address this were not sufficient to have an impact. Had the project been more focused on the needs of people, which would have likely included lower water prices for poor people, the department would have been obliged to engage with the workings of the state water corporation. The Wash project was on the borderline between humanitarian assistance and development, said the report, because it sought to address the needs of IDPs who were considered unlikely to return home. However, it failed to fully take into account the high number of displaced people who would set up home on the fringes of Darfur&apos;s urban centres and become reliant on humanitarian aid. DfID had taken its eye off the ball, focusing instead on supporting the implementation of a peace agreement and not long-term development projects. In 2008, the department aimed to move away from short-term support, but &quot;DfID had not yet progressed very far with this transition. The bulk of its support continues to be short-term in nature&quot;. The reason, said the report, is the department&apos;s &quot;lack of real partnership with the government of Sudan and the higher strategic priority DfID placed on other aspects of its engagement with Sudan&quot;. Icai said DfID needed to look at ways to move from supporting emergency Wash projects to investing in sustainable infrastructure. It should stop channelling funds through the CHF and instead work with direct partners, such as Tearfund. &quot;The Darfur experience suggests that DfID lacks an established approach for dealing with protracted humanitarian crises. Having been unable to move from humanitarian into development planning, DfID found itself repeating much the same set of emergency interventions, despite concerns about diminishing returns and the risks of aid dependence,&quot; said the report. DfID said its new programmes would help the poorest people to become better able to cope with the impact of conflict or disasters. In response to the report, a research officer at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) thinktank, Nathaniel Mason, said: &quot;Delivering water and sanitation services in protracted crises is a difficult task and it remains difficult as you move from providing humanitarian support to longer term development. &quot;Icai is right to highlight the need for a sound understanding of the political context  Using NGOs as delivery partners can work but, as the report points out, DfID and others should consider how they can build local capacity in the long term.&quot; DfID fared better in its livelihoods work in Odisha state, India (pdf), and peace and security programmes in Nepal (pdf), which were rated by Icai as green and green-amber respectively in separate reports also published on Thursday. The watchdog praised DfID&apos;s 10-year, 33m project to support community-based businesses in Odisha. The project had increased incomes and enabled communities to cope better with drought and heavy rains. &quot;Icai considers many aspects of it to be best practice, which should be used to inform future programming for livelihoods and climate resilience projects,&quot; said the report. DfID&apos;s five peace projects in Nepal, which cost 53m and included rehabilitation for child soldiers, support for elections, access for justice and police reform, were planned well and had positively supported the peace process, Icai said. However, it added, DfID had not responded to the changing political situation in the country and needed to urgently do so to avoid jeopardising future success.",

    "text": "What youll learnSociology is the study of human societies and how they interact to shape peoples beliefs, behaviours and identity. The subject is the academic cousin to the more practical social policy, so you will examine different social theories and models (expect mention of Karl Marx at least). You will also explore how society has changed over time, touching on subjects such as industrialisation, urbanisation, inequality and globalisation. You may find yourself investigating consumer society, looking at classic and contemporary (postmodern) theories of consumerism, and applying these to shopping, fashion or music. You could look at work and employment, how these are viewed in societies, and how these views have changed over the years. Expect to explore issues of feminism, class and the trade union movement. You could also study sexuality, religion, or youth culture and identity. Sociology courses can often be studied alongside other complementary subjects, such as history, social policy, politics, or cultural or gender studies.   sociology   How youll learnExpect lectures, seminars and plenty of independent study. Youll be required to carry out independent research, but also know how to discuss ideas, facts and figures within a group. By the time you graduate, you should have sharp, critical thinking and good problem-solving skills. Youll also develop good communication skills that allow you to present your arguments clearly in a variety of styles. What entry requirements youll needEntry requirements vary, but its likely that A-levels (or equivalent) in sociology, psychology, geography, computing or computer science could help your application.   sociology   What job can I get?Sociology graduates are found in a variety of jobs. Among the favourites are those in the social services, which, with a bit of extra study, could involve becoming a social worker. Alternatively, a job in education, the criminal justice system, in local and central government as a researcher, or in the voluntary sector, perhaps working as a fundraiser, community development worker or counsellor, could be more your thing. You will also have the skills to pursue a career in journalism or management, or in academia.",

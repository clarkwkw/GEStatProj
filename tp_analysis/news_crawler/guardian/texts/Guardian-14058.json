    "text": "To play Lego City Undercover is to know joy. Hyperbole, perhaps, but rule-breaking cop Chase McCain&apos;s adventure is easily one of the finest games yet produced under the Lego banner. It delivers all the charm and humour the series is known for, while lovingly parodying the whole crime drama genre. Gameplay remains similar to previous entries, destroying and rebuilding surroundings to progress through story missions, while free play allows exploration of the vast Lego City to unlock new characters, vehicles and areas. However, the Wii U gamepad adds several well-implemented new features, including an ever-present (and much-needed) map, crowd-scanning for crooks and tracking.Criminally, there&apos;s no co-op  a staple of Lego outings  but it&apos;s merely a misdemeanour, given the overall quality on offer here.",

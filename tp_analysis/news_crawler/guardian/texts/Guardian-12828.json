    "text": "A slew of rumours about Sony&apos;s upcoming PlayStation 4 announcement paint a fascinating picture of what the next generation might look like. Very slightly more powerful than the leaked specification for Microsoft&apos;s successor to Xbox 360, the new PlayStation will have a redesigned controller with built-in touchpad and a &apos;share&apos; functionality that automatically records your last 15 minutes of gameplay, ready to be edited and paraded in front of friends and followers online. A common whinge from developers was that PlayStation 3 was awkward to programme for. With that in mind, Sony&apos;s new console will have far more in common with PC architecture. The bad news for British gamers is that it&apos;s unlikely to appear in this country until 2014. Sony&apos;s press conference, scheduled for 20 Feb, is sure to have plenty more juicy details.",

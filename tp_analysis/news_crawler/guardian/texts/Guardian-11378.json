All that changes with Dragonborn, which lets you leave Skyrim for the island of Solstheim, an entirely separate land mass. It comes with new monsters and towns - best of all, though, is the impression of virgin territory: seeing a suspicious light in the distance or ruins on a hilltop and galloping off to see what&apos;s going on. It provides a hearty slab of exploration along with an interesting mystery to unravel.",

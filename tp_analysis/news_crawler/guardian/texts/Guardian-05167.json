    "text": "The past two years have been a wild ride for Groupon, and on Wednesday&apos;s earnings call the online disount company faces its biggest test to date as investors get their first look at Groupon as a publicly traded company. Two years ago Groupon was being hailed as the &quot;fastest growing company ever&quot; by Forbes magazine. Google offered $6bn for the firm in December 2010, but Andrew Mason, the company&apos;s founder, rejected it.  Last November the firm went public in the biggest, most hyped initial public offering (IPO) since Google. It&apos;s now valued at $15bn but, according to critics, the cracks are showing.  Groupon&apos;s shares were priced at $20 a piece when the firm went public. Thanks to investor appetite, and the small number of shares sold, they soared to $28 on their first day of trading but have drifted down ever since. Now operating in 45 countries, the company will report its fourth-quarter results, and analysts expect sales of $473m, up nearly threefold from a year ago. For the full year, Groupon is expected to have revenues of $1.6bn. All big numbers, but profits have been in short supply and with the firm valued at just under $15bn, growth may not be enough to support its current share price. Rick Summer, an analyst at Morning Star, believes Groupon&apos;s shares should be trading closer to $8. &quot;Given the company&apos;s phenomenal growth it&apos;s understandable people would get excited about the company,&quot; he said, adding that the firm was being valued as an internet company when it doesn&apos;t make internet profit margins. Facebook, which filed its own IPO papers last week, recently revealed it had pre-tax operating margins of 47%. Summer calculates that in the long term, Groupon&apos;s margins will be in the low single figures. All this as competition increases from coupon competitors, including Google and the Amazon-backed Living Social. &quot;The only advantage of scale in this business is the ability to stay in business as opposed to going out of business,&quot; Summer said.",

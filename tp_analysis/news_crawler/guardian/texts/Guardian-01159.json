    "text": "New figures out are expected to show that applications from UK pupils to study at university this autumn are down on last year, with mature students in particular turning away from highereducation. The figures, published by Ucas, the body responsible for processing university places, will be seized on by critics of the government as evidence that the near tripling in tuition fees, which kicks in this autumn, is deterring people from studying. However, experts stressed it was too early to say whether the predicted decline was the start of a trend. In December, a total of 283,680 UK students had applied to study at university, compared with 306,908 at the same time the previous year, a 7.6% decline. The proportion of students in their twenties who applied was down by about 15%, while the number of non-EU students was up by more than 13%. Subjects expected to see a sharp decline, are technology, architecture and non-European languages. The predicted year-on-year drop may be partially explained by a rise in the number of students who applied in 2010, keen to avoid the rise in fees this autumn that will see many students pay 9,000 a year for their university education. But a sharp drop in mature students  often people who have taken time out after school to work and save for their education  will be attacked by the government&apos;s critics as a check on ambition. &quot;All through the application process for autumn 2012 we have seen a drastic reduction in the number of university applicants aged over 21,&quot; said Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students. &quot;Should this continue in the final figures, it is a deeply worrying sign that people looking to get education and training to further their ambitions are avoiding university and the debt that comes with it.&quot; Mature students make up around a third of the undergraduate population and are more likely to be women and to be studying vocational subjects. &quot;Many young people decide not to go to university when they finish their A-levels, and after a few years in employment decide that they need extra skills or to retrain, and it is clear that the government&apos;s decision to raise tuition fees and cut teaching funding is impacting them particularly hard,&quot; Burns said. There had been speculation that Monday&apos;s figures would show a 15% to 20% drop in overall applications, but there is evidence that, as the deadline for applications approached, pupils were continuing to weigh up their university options, suggesting that they were leaving their decisions late, and that the total decline would not be as severe as predicted. &quot;We may well see a dip in overall student applications this summer, but probably far less dramatic than many were initially predicting,&quot; said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, the body that represents UK universities. &quot;We saw a similar dip in 2006 when tuition fees increased to 3,000, which then rectified in subsequent years.&quot; Dandridge said it was important that Monday&apos;s figures were scrutinised to see whether higher fees were affecting particular types of potential student. &quot;We will have to look at whether the changes to the funding system affect certain groups of applicants more than others,&quot; she said. &quot;In particular, whether the dip is made up disproportionately of students from poorer backgrounds. Universities UK will be monitoring these figures closely over the coming months.&quot; A sustained decline in applications would reverse Tony Blair&apos;s achievement of meeting a target of 40% of all 18- to 30-year-olds attending university. Some experts have questioned whether that target is sustainable. But Dandridge said the UK still lagged behind many countries when it came to the percentage of high-skilled individuals in its population, something that would affect its ability to compete globally. &quot;We are by no means leading the way on higher education participation for an advanced economy,&quot; she said. &quot;In terms of the proportion of 25- to 64-year-olds with a higher education qualification, we lag behind Canada, Israel, Japan, the US, New Zealand and Russia. And China, let&apos;s not forget, is projected to produce more graduates than the US and Europe combined by 2020.&quot;",

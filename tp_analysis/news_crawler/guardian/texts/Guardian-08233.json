    "text": "In a world where three colossal nations vie for power, brothers Asbel and Hubert Lhant are more interested in their childhood adventures. But, on finding an amnesiac girl in a field of flowers, a series of events is triggered that will haunt the youngsters into adulthood and beyond. So begins Tales of Graces f, the latest in a long-running series of Japanese RPGs, yet one that is only now starting to gain traction with western gamers. And, yes, as a J-RPG you can look forward to a near 80-hour epic full of oddly named characters with unlikely backstories who ultimately decide (cue portentous drumroll) the fate of the world. It&apos;s endearingly melodramatic at times and largely typical of the genre made famous by Final Fantasy, but also does a whole lot more to move it forward. Combat is a speedy affair, your main character delivering flurries of attacks at your command while team-mates run on programmable objectives. Basic to start with, greater strategy is revealed as you progress and you&apos;ll soon relish each battle. There&apos;s a surprisingly in-depth collectable creation system, too, turning otherwise inconsequential items into useful healing items or weapons. With cutscenes provided by famed animation studio Production IG and character designs by the anime world&apos;s finest, Tales of Graces f offers a refreshing take on a genre that once looked past it. Engrossing fun. ",

    "text": "Japan&apos;s attempts to restart nuclear reactors that were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi accident were boosted after UN inspectors gave their backing to stress tests designed to confirm the reactors&apos; safety. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] said the reactor assessments were &quot;generally consistent&quot; with the body&apos;s own safety standards, despite concern among some experts that the tests are flawed. The IAEA&apos;s upbeat appraisal was expected, and does not guarantee that Japan&apos;s nuclear authorities will be able to put reactors back into service amid growing opposition from host communities in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. The team arrived in Japan nine days ago at the invitation of the Japanese government to review stress tests being conducted by the country&apos;s industrial and nuclear safety agency (Nisa). The tests, in which computer simulations are used to gauge the reactors&apos; ability to withstand severe events such as earthquakes and tsunami, were ordered after a triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March unleashed large amounts of radiation into the environment. The accident, the worst involving nuclear power since Chernobyl 25 years ago, forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents living within a 12-mile (20km) radius of the plant. Almost a year on from the disaster, none of the residents has been allowed to return home; some have been warned their old neighbourhoods may remain uninhabitable for years. James Lyons, the leader of the 10-member IAEA team, said: &quot;We concluded that Nisa&apos;s instructions to power plants and its review process for the comprehensive safety assessments are generally consistent with IAEA safety standards.&quot; Nisa officials said their first evaluation showed that two idle reactors at a plant in Oi, western Japan, were able to withstanding a disaster similar to the magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami that wrecked Fukushima Daiichi. But two experts who sit on a panel advising Nisa on the safety appraisal said the stress tests were too limited in scope and did not prove that nuclear reactors were safe, adding that the IAEA visit was simply a public relations exercise. &quot;It is obvious that a visit by an international organisation advocating nuclear power is part of a political agenda that is built into a story already finished in advance,&quot; Professor Hiromitsu Ino of Tokyo University and Masashi Goto, a former nuclear plant design engineer, said in a statement. Quake damage and scheduled safety checks prompted by the Fukushima accident mean that all but three of Japan&apos;s 54 reactors are out of service. Without approval for restarts, Japan will be without a single operating nuclear reactor by the end of April. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, has said, however, the country can survive the summer free of power cuts even without nuclear power. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, believes Japan needs to retain a number of reactors while it develops alternative energy sources. The Fukushima crisis forced the country to abandon plans to generate more than 50% of its power from nuclear by 2030. Towns that host nuclear power plants have criticised the government for introducing the tests before the official investigation into the Fukushima accident is complete. Local approval is not legally required to restart a reactor, but few believe the government will bring plants back online without public support. In another measure designed to bolster public confidence in nuclear power, the cabinet on Tuesday approved legislation that will end the nuclear safety agency&apos;s organisational ties to the trade and industry ministry. The ministry has been criticised for failing to recognise the dangers posed by nuclear power and for its close ties to utilities. The bill would also limit a reactor&apos;s operational lifespan to 40 years, with a controversial one-time extension of 20 years for those that pass additional safety tests. One of the six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi went into service 41 years ago.",

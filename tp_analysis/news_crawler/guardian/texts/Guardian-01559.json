    "text": "Social gaming firm Zynga released its first set of results as a public company on Tuesday and beat Wall Street&apos;s expectations, but only just. The game maker behind CityVille, FarmVille and Words With Friends delivered fourth-quarter revenues of $307m, or 5 cents per share. Analysts had expected the company to report earnings excluding items of 3 cents per share on revenues of $302 million, according to Thomson Reuters. The company&apos;s shares fell heavily in trading after the closing bell. Zynga&apos;s shares slumped after the firm went public last year but have been riding high since it was revealed that the firm accounted for 12% of Facebook&apos;s revenues. For the period ended 31 December, Zynga reported a net loss of $435m, or $1.22 a share, compared to net earnings of $43 million, or five cents a share, for the same period the previous year. The company said 54m people were &quot;daily active users&quot; of Zynga games in the fourth quarter compared to 48m in the fourth quarter of 2011, a rise of 13%. The number of monthly active users was up 23% at 240m. At the end of the year Zynga accounted for all of the top five games played on Facebook. In a statement, founder and chief executive officer Mark Pincus said: &quot;Zynga set new records in the year in terms of audience size, revenues and bookings. We saw great momentum in mobile and advertising and ended the year with a strong pipeline of new games. We are excited about the opportunities in front of us to continue delighting our current players and to bring play to millions of new people.&quot;",

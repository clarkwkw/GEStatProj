Some Apple engineers argued for a more-aggressive approach that would integrate payments more directly.  But Apple executives chose the go-slow approach for now. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the decision-making process.  Apple&apos;s head of world-wide marketing, Phil Schiller, in an interview last month, said that digital-wallet mobile-payment services are &quot;all fighting over their piece of the pie, and we aren&apos;t doing that.&quot;...Last year, Apple engineers and executives considered some aggressive approaches to exploit that advantage when in-house debate over the market began in earnest. Google unveiled its Android payment system around the same time.  A small group began investigating whether the company should create a new service that would embed various payment methods into the iPhone or build a payment network of its own, according to people familiar with the matter . Apple&apos;s head of iPhone software, Scott Forstall, was interested in the idea, say people familiar with the matter, and engineers on his team began to brainstorm a comprehensive &quot;wallet app.&quot;   The blockage: effect on NFC on battery life, and retailers&apos; slow takeup in the US. Basically, it has it all ready - but is waiting for the market to arrive. (Subscription required.) Google adds &apos;Do Not Track&apos; to Chrome &gt;&gt; PCWorld  Google has added a Do Not Track privacy option to Chrome&apos;s developer channel, though it&apos;s late to the party compared to other browsers. When Do Not Track is enabled in a browser, it signals to Websites and to advertisers that the user doesn&apos;t want to be followed around the web for ad targeting purposes. Ad networks and sites aren&apos;t required to comply, but several of them do, and the U.S. government is now pressuring more companies to play along, including Google.  Apple Maps: The FAQ &gt;&gt; counternotions  As they say, every turn-by-turn direction starts with the first step.  LG Display holds 70% of iPad panel shipments &gt;&gt; Digitimes  LG Display is now responsible for 70% of iPad panel shipments while Samsung Electronics, Sharp and Chimei Innolux (CMI) have all been seeing decreasing shipments, according to industry sources.  Samsung originally accounted for a large portion of iPad panel shipments and was shipping over one million iPad panels in July. However, as of August the company had dropped to roughly 700,000 in iPad panel shipments and that number may decrease even more, added the sources.  The decrease is a significant drop from Samsung&apos;s monthly average of 2.5m iPad panel shipments during the first half of 2012, said the sources. The sources did not specify specific reasons for the drop in shipments but market observers suspect it has to do with disputes between Apple and Samsung.  When the patent lawyer met the genie &gt;&gt; SMBC Splork? Apple accused of ripping off famous Swiss clock design &gt;&gt; CNET News  In a report in Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger (by way of Macrumors), the Swiss Federal Railway service, or SBB, has taken offense to the app&apos;s design, to which it says it owns the trademark.  The 1944 design by then-SBB employee Hans Hilfiker (which you can see here) is used in station clocks throughout the railway system, which is well-known for its timeliness. It&apos;s also licensed to Mondaine, a Swiss watch manufacturer.  An SBB spokesman told Tages-Anzeiger that he was pleased Apple was using the design, but noted that the company was not authorized to do so. The report suggests a legal complaint is being drafted as a result.   Someone forgot that if there&apos;s one thing the Swiss take seriously, it&apos;s their clocks. Wal-Mart says it will stop selling Amazon&apos;s Kindle &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  Wal-Mart Stores, the nation&apos;s largest retailer, said Thursday it was dropping Amazon&apos;s Kindle tablets and e-readers, a sign of how seriously it views Amazon as a competitor in the consumer goods market.  Target said in May that it would stop selling Kindles, though other stores, including Best Buy, Staples and Office Depot, said Thursday they would continue to carry the devices.  What does Twitter know about me? My .zip file with 50Mb of data  Anne Helmond  Three weeks ago I read a tweet from @web_martin who had requested all his data from Twitter under European law and received a .zip file with his data from Twitter. He linked to the Privacy International blog which has written down step by step how to request your own data.   You, too, can play if you live in the EU - though Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has indicated that Twitter will allow you to download all your tweets by the end of this year. We&apos;ll see. Asus to unveil the Padfone 2 in October &gt;&gt; Liliputing  The Asus Padfone hasn&apos;t exactly taken the world by storm since Asus first introduced the smartphone that can transform into a tablet, notebook, or desktop with liberal use of docking stations. In fact, the Padfone has yet to officially go on sale in the US.  But Asus is getting ready to launch the Padfone 2.   On 16 October, it seems. German court says Samsung and Motorola don&apos;t infringe Apple&apos;s touch event model patent &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents  Unlike the multitouch patents that Apple asserted at the recent California trial, each one of which is specific to a particular gesture, this is a fairly broad patent that covers the way the operating system reports touch events to applications or purposely ignores them. If Apple&apos;s proposed interpretation of this patent had been adopted by the court, numerous applications that rely on the attacked operating system functionality would no longer run in a reliable, stable fashion after a workaround. This would have caused logistical complications with the need to rewrite, recompile and reinstall many apps.   Now it won&apos;t. New iPhone, old abuses: Have working conditions at Foxconn in China improved? &gt;&gt; SACOM  Now, in September 2012, our researchers revisited Foxconn&apos;s plants in Zhengzhou, HenanProvince, China, whose sole product is the iPhone. Most of the 60 interviewees who SACOM talked to are new workers recruited by the government. The high turnover rate and the government&apos;s need to recruit workers and take other special steps to smooth production implicitly suggest that job satisfaction is not high. More than that, SACOM&apos;s new investigation finds that Foxconn workers in Zhengzhou are still facing deplorably harsh working conditions. It is disappointing that no matter how advanced the technology introduced by Apple is, the old problems in working conditions remain at its major supplier Foxconn.

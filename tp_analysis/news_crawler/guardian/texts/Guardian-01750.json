    "text": "Australian philosopher David Chalmers called it &apos;the hard problem&apos;. For a long time the exclusive preserve of philosophy, understanding the conscious mind is fast becoming an important field of research in neuroscience. This week&apos;s edition of Science Weekly is dedicated to the endeavour.  The annual meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness comes to the UK in the summer, and on 7 March at the Royal Institution in London, Science Weekly presenter Alok Jha will host a debate entitled Consciousness: The Hard Problem? To discuss this slippery subject ahead of the debate Alok brought the three leading researchers and thinkers who will be participating into the Science Weekly studio: Dr Anil Seth, co-director of the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science at Sussex University; Professor Chris Frith, professor emeritus at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London; and Professor Barry Smith, director of the Institute of Philosophy at the School of Advanced Study, University of London.

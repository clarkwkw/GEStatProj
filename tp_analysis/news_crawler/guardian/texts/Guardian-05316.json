[I will identify these species in 48 hours]  Image: Eric Kowalczyk, 26 October 2007 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Olympus u20D,S400D,u400D.    Question: This is a departure from what I usually do with the daily mystery bird. I am thrilled to share this image of a young woman from Papua New Guinea -- a place I&apos;ve been fascinated by ever since I was a child. As you can see, she is wearing a spectacular traditional costume, consisting of a dozen or more native bird species or their feathers. For example, I can see eight species of birds of paradise and several parrot species in this young woman&apos;s headdress and body decorations without studying this image carefully. I am sure there are more. How many bird species can you identify? (Seriously, you can name them, no puns, anagrams or other cryptic clues necessary, and I&apos;ll compile all the species in the demystification that publishes in 48 hours.) The Rules:    1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours.  2. If you know the mystery bird&apos;s identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints so others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints may read like &quot;inside jokes&quot; and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game:  1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.  If you have bird images, video or mp3 files that you&apos;d like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at The Guardian, feel free to contact me to learn more.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist email: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

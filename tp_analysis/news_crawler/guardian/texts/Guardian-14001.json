    "text": "I have always regarded myself as a &apos;public criminologist&apos;  in other words an academic criminologist who, while teaching, writing and researching at a university, also engages in popular debates in the print and broadcast media about crime and punishment. These debates are issues that are (for want of a better description) tabloid staples: sex offenders, serial killers, naming and shaming, child killers, &quot;holiday camp prisons&quot;, bringing back hanging, yobs, slobs and ASBOs. Have I mentioned sex offenders? As a public criminologist, I have wanted to see if I could answer these questions by putting them into a broader context that recognises their complexity, and introduces the grey areas around issues usually reported as if they were simply black and white. And so, over the past 10 years, I have become a familiar face on This Morning, Channel 4 and Sky News, and a regular voice on Today, PM and 5Live. Presenting Channel 5&apos;s series Killers Behind Bars has allowed me to take this public criminology one stage further, harnessing the public&apos;s fascination with serial murder, then demonstrating how academic theories related to this phenomenon and this type of murderer might also contribute to clearing up &apos;cold cases&apos;. The impact, to use a favourite REF (Research Excellence Framework) preoccupation, has been marked, not just in soaring applications to study criminology at Birmingham City University(BUC), attendance at open days and student engagement more generally, but also in the public&apos;s interest in the cold cases featured within the series, and even the willingness of some police forces to reconsider evidence that the programme uncovers. Presenting a TV programme on the subject you teach and research might therefore be seen as a &apos;win-win&apos;: greater awareness of your course, soaring numbers of Twitter followers, better public understanding of the phenomenon you research, and actual results that might eventually lead to justice for families who still want to see a perpetrator held to account. All of this is true, but there are tensions too. From a personal point of view, the greatest tension is the growing perception by some members of the public that I am a celebrity, rather than an academic  bizarre, personal difficulties that flow from this perceived status. So, for example, I receive over 100 emails every day from members of the public and (reflecting changing times) about 10 letters, all wanting me to investigate cases, or go for tea with the writer, sign autographs, recommend books and, in the cases of students who write from other universities, read their essays. This is a tension created by accessibility. Celebrities are usually hard to reach, whereas academics have their telephone numbers, email addresses and office hour details published on the university&apos;s website. And of course members of the public can simply walk on to most campuses. We rightly pride ourselves that we are &apos;community-facing&apos; in higher education. But this accessibility can have its downsides, especially when you become known as someone who deals with violent offenders, as opposed to an academic who presents programmes about physics or history. During the run of the last series and again as a result of the publicity for this new series, I have had two death threats  both well managed by BCU&apos;s campus security and the West Midlands Police. There are tensions too within academia. Some now label me a populist who has dumbed-down and sold out, even if I continue to publish monographs and peer review articles, act as director of a research centre, and edit the Howard Journal of Criminal Justice. There is still a very uneasy relationship between British academics and &apos;public&apos; sociology / philosophy / psychology (insert your own subject area here). Many of my UK academic peers don&apos;t seem very comfortable talking about their work outside the lecture theatre and, frankly would rather run a mile, or take on extra marking, than speak to the press. This is all different from the American approach, where even the humblest masters student is usually capable of stringing an intelligent but accessible comment to the local radio about what he or she might be writing about. The final tension is time. It would be wonderful to be able to respond positively to every request for help from members of the public, but that simply isn&apos;t possible. Saying no often leaves the person who has made contact feeling no one is prepared to assist them. You might also open up a can of worms. One recent email request about an alleged miscarriage of justice, about which I did some preliminary research before excusing myself for ethical reasons (knowing the trial judge personally), was followed up with an angry claim that, contrary to my TV &apos;personality&apos;, I simply wasn&apos;t interested in justice. Nothing could be further from the truth. So, what advice would I give to other academics who are interested in doing TV? Without doubt I would encourage them. The benefits greatly outweigh the downsides, but go into this world with your eyes open. You will need to balance the various and often competing demands made of you by both professional and public audiences, and that balance can only ever be established if you have a clear idea of why it is that you want to use the media. For me, no matter what the problems, public criminology still has both an exciting role to play in cooling the red hot passions of the law and order debate, and bringing academic theory out of the classroom and into people&apos;s homes.

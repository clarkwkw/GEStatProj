It&apos;s been nearly seven years since the last PlayStation was revealed; would another month or two have tipped some scale?Whoever this was aimed at  developers, hardcore gamers, casual gamers  the utter lack of usable information makes the timing questionable at best. There are also competitive repercussions: Sony has now shown its hand way ahead of time. Microsoft is not expected to announce its next-generation Xbox until E3 in June, leaving more than three months to respond accordingly. If Sony&apos;s offering ends up superior to the Xbox when that announcement happens, then Sony hasn&apos;t gained much, because we still don&apos;t know what it has or what it can do, and it&apos;ll be months-old news.If Sony&apos;s offering ends up inferior, it will be upstaged and stale.  Writeup on nbc.com distributing Citadel malware &gt;&gt; Fox-IT International blog  At 16:43 CET, this afternoon we noticed that the NBC.com website links to the redkit exploit kit that is spreading Citadel malware, targeting US financialsinstitutions. This version of Citadel is onlyrecognizableby 3 out of the 46 antivirus programs on virustotal.com.  Simply everywhere. Commercial, not state-sponsored, hacking. Malware attack on Apple said to come from eastern Europe &gt;&gt; Bloomberg This is the hack of the iPhoneSDK site which also affected Facebook and Twitter:   Investigators suspect that the hackers are a criminal group based in Russia or Eastern Europe, and have tracked at least one server being used by the group to a hosting company in the Ukraine. Other evidence, including the malware used in the attack, also suggest it is the work of cyber criminals rather than state-sponsored espionage from China, two people familiar with the investigation said.  PlayStation 4 launch: no glitz, just an old school press conference &gt;&gt; guardian.co.uk Our own Keith Stuart:   No one should have expected a price. Possibly we shouldn&apos;t have expected a launch date or an actual console either. This is the way Sony rolls. Think back to 2005 if you can. The PS3 reveal. There was an event early in the year to announce the console, then another at E3 to actually provide lots of the intrinsic detail. The same thing happened with the PS2. And with the original machine, Sony&apos;s first press releases didn&apos;t even name it. So anyone who sat through last night&apos;s two-hour extravaganza thinking &quot;hang on, what does it LOOK like?&quot; just hasn&apos;t been to enough Sony hardware reveals.  Secretly? We were hoping for a price, console and date. Like the handset and tablet makers usually do. Because that&apos;s who Sony is up against now - make no mistake. Samsung Copy &amp; Paste Bug (AKA Never Trust Samsung) &gt;&gt; Terence Eden has a Blog  Sounds crazy, doesn&apos;t it? If you copy and paste text more than 20 times, your phone will restart! Some people have reported more severe crashes than that - but for me it is only (!) a soft restart. This affects the Galaxy Note II, as well as the SIII and Note tablet. Other Samsung products may also be broken in this manner You must be a... Oh give it a rest! I&apos;m an equal opportunity curmudgeon. I like Linux and generally favour Android, but I get pissed off at anyone who produces a shitty product and doesn&apos;t stand behind it. Samsung - either up your game, or get off the pitch.  Researchers develop technique to remotely control cockroaches &gt;&gt; North Carolina State University  Researchers from North Carolina State University have developed a technique that uses an electronic interface to remotely control, or steer, cockroaches. &quot;Our aim was to determine whether we could create a wireless biological interface with cockroaches, which are robust and able to infiltrate small spaces,&quot; says Alper Bozkurt, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at NC State and co-author of a paper on the work. &quot;Ultimately, we think this will allow us to create a mobile web of smart sensors that uses cockroaches to collect and transmit information, such as finding survivors in a building that&apos;s been destroyed by an earthquake.&quot;  Anonymous helps researchers link hackers to Chinese army &gt;&gt; Huffington Post  In February 2011, Anonymous gained access to the website rootkit.com - an online forum where hackers and researchers share information about hacking techniques - and published personal data of more than 40,000 registered users online. The data included email and IP addresses. The breach was one of dozens by Anonymous over the past two years and gained relatively little media attention. But now, two years later, security researchers say the data was valuable in helping them find links between hackers and the Chinese military. &quot;We are fortunate to have access to the accounts disclosed from rootkit.com,&quot; the Mandiant report said. Anonymous&apos; disclosure of the rookit.com information included an email and IP address for the username &quot;uglygorilla.&quot; The IP information, which identifies the location from which the user is accessing the Internet, pinned the hacker to a place close to a 12-story office tower in Shanghai that researchers believe is the headquarters of P.L.A. Unit 61398 -- cyber warriors for the Chinese military.  What&apos;s the phrase for collateral damage when it&apos;s collateral but isn&apos;t damage? Let me get this straight &gt;&gt; David Chartier On ways to market. BlackBerry Z10 sales estimates slashed by 83% | BGR  Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley had initially called for BlackBerry to sell about 1.75m BlackBerry Z10 smartphones in the February quarter. But after his checks following the phone&apos;s launch in the UK and Canada found limited initial supply and softer than expected demand, the analyst slashed his estimates for the current quarter from 1.75m units to just 300,000 &quot;With new BB10 smartphones launching in the US only in mid-March or later at subsidized prices no better than competing high-end Apple/Samsung smartphones, combined with our expectations for the Galaxy S IV to launch at a similar time frame in the US market, we are lowering our BB10 sales estimates for the February quarter and all of [BlackBerry fiscal year] 2014.&quot;  BlackBerry&apos;s quarter ends at the end of February.

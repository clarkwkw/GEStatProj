    "text": "In 2006 Dr Simon Colton, a researcher in computational creativity at Imperial College, London, started to explore whether a computer program with the capacity to create art could be taken as seriously as a human artist. Where did the idea for the program you call the Painting Fool come from? As a hobby I wrote software that would turn a photograph into a more artistic piece, but six years ago I brought it into my field of research. I realised that the Painting Fool was a very good mechanism for testing out all sorts of theories, such as what it means for software to be creative. The aim of the project is for the software itself to be taken seriously as a creative artist in its own right, one day. How does it work? The Painting Fool produces artwork in a number of ways. The first is the simplest one: the software paints according to user-defined input, such as a photograph. But last year I had an exhibition in Paris called No Photos Were Harmed that challenged the public perception of computer art. I presented a couple of pieces, one of which was The Dancing Salesman Problem, where the figures were generated by a context-free design grammar, which is similar to the grammatical structure of natural language but for images. I&apos;ve also paired the Painting Fool with emotion-detection software by Maja Pantic, a colleague of mine, so it paints pictures in different styles according to the subject&apos;s mood, like the Really Sad picture of me, where it chose muted colours and graphite pencil. Each of these projects tries to challenge a notion about computer programs - that they can&apos;t be imaginative, that they can&apos;t appreciate how the output might affect people. How will you know when it is taken seriously as an artist? People want to know artwork has been constructed with an intelligent thought process, so perhaps once the software produces pieces that are culturally valuable, that get people talking, and are not necessarily anything that I&apos;m keen on aesthetically or conceptually, that would be a good indication of its independence from me.",

    "text": "    This Friday we&apos;re joined by campaigners at the Environmental Justice Foundation who are fighting illegal fishing off the coast of West Africa. Max Schmid and Victor Cole on EJF&apos;s oceans team will be chatting live online from Sierra Leone between 1 and 2pm on 8 June on their efforts to stop the illegal and unregulated fishing in the region by foreign vessels. Their work with coastal communities reporting such fishing was recently recognised when they won an Energy Globe Award. Want to know more about the scale of the problem in Sierra Leone, and how it can be tackled? Want to know how it compares to other West African countries, such as Senegal, which recently revoked licenses for foreign fishing trawlers? Or do you have a more general questions about illegal fishing, and the state of our oceans? Just post your questions below - the EJF team will do their best to answer as many as possible on Friday.",

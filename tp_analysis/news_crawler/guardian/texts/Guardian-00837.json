    "text": " 10.48am: It&apos;s the day the free world (well, students, journalists, and PR consultants) has been dreading: Wikipedia is down, in protest at proposed US anti-piracy legislation, and it&apos;ll stay that way until 5pm today. But fear not! Guardipedia is here to help.  One of my senior colleagues has informed me of something called the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which seems to be some sort of paper book (I know!) containing all sorts of facts.  The good news is, I&apos;ve fetched it from the library upstairs - all 29 volumes of it - and I&apos;m going to use it to answer any factual questions you throw at me via Twitter (@Guardian) or the comments section below. The bad news is it was published in 1989, and doesn&apos;t seem to contain anything in the way of recent information.  What is tattooed on the back of Megan Fox&apos;s neck? I couldn&apos;t tell you. Where was Arthur Scargill born? Now we&apos;re talking. Fire away!  11.01am: This really is technological doomsday. Not only is Wikipedia down, but something seems to be wrong with our comments system. We&apos;re working on it, but in the meantime, tweet your pre-1989 factual questions to either @Guardian or @PatrickKingsley. Meanwhile: here&apos;s a great animation explaining what Wikipedia are protesting about.  11.18am: So this is what the 90s was like! People must have had very sore thumbs. Anyway, exciting news: I have my first question. My colleague Andrew Gilchrist wants to know about a book called the King of the Gypsies, which is apparently by a bare-knuckle fighter called Bartley Gorman. Now for the crushing disappointment. Andrew, there is absolutely no reference to Bartley Gorman in Britannica, or in this dusty thing called the Biographical Dictionary I found in that library place upstairs. Sorry to let you down. And please forgive the time it&apos;s taken to get back to you. These books don&apos;t have hyperlinks. Weird.  11.25am: A tweeter by the name of @Jet_Lau asks:  How many pages are all 29 volumes together?  Good question, Jet! I&apos;ll be right back.  11.48am: Several observant readers have raised the pertinent points that a) the Encyclopaedia Britannica is online; b) you can actually bypass Wikipedia&apos;s blackout thusly. Now this is all well and good - but you&apos;re spoiling the fun, people. Lighten up. Moving swiftly on, commenter Peter4321 has a question: &quot;Who killed JFK?&quot; Great question, Peter! And after 13 minutes of searching, I have an answer. Of sorts. It&apos;s from the section on the Warren Commission, formally &quot;President&apos;s Commission On The Assassination Of President John F Kennedy&quot;:  The commission reported that the bullets that had killed President Kennedy were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald from a rifle pointed out of a sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository ... This conclusion of the commission was later questioned in a number of books and articles and in a special ciongressional committee report in 1979.  So there. Hope that helps. If you want more info, have a look at page 501 of the 12th volume (&quot;Trudeau - Zywiec&quot;) of the fifteenth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, published in 1989.  11.58am: MaxtonWalker asks:   Did Queen Victoria ever play bass for Led Zeppelin? It said she did on her Wikipedia entry last time I looked.  ... while QuetzalcoatlUk wants to know:  In Charles Dickens&apos; novel Bleak House is the slum Tom-All-Alone&apos;s completely fictional or was it an actual area of London, or perhaps based on a real area or areas of the metropolis?  And then SamJordison was wondering:  Could you list the complete works of Charles Dickens in a handy cut and paste format for me?  I&apos;m on it, guys, I&apos;m on it. Bear with me.  12.00pm: By the way, @Jet_Lau, it&apos;s taking too long to count all the pages, but so far I&apos;ve got through at least 11048. Hope that helps.  12.13pm: If you&apos;re wondering why this is all taking so long, it&apos;s because this research lark is a nightmare. There are no hyperlinks, no searchboxes - and what the devil&apos;s an &quot;index&quot;? Bloody unhelpful, that&apos;s what. Moving all those encyclopaedias was a complete fiasco, by the way. They each weigh about five kilos. I had to stack them skyscraper-style on my chair, wheel the chair to the lift, and then when the lift got to the second floor, they all fell over and blocked the corridor. What a rumpus. Wikipedia (and all journalists who starting work pre-2000): I salute you.  12.21pm: Right, SamJordison, here are the complete works of Charles Dickens, who is &quot;generally regarded as the greatest English novelist&quot;, apparently. (Er - Martin Amis, anyone?) Anyway, so: The Pickwick Papers (1837); Oliver Twist (1838); Nicholas Nickleby (1839); The Old Curiosity Shop (1841); Barnaby Rudge (also 1841 - prolific!); &quot;two novels published in a &apos;clock framework&apos;, later abandoned, under the title of Master Humphrey&apos;s Clock&quot; (whatevs!); Martin Chuzzlewit (1844); Dombey and Son (1848); David Copperfield (1850); Bleak House (1853); Hard Times (1854); Little Dorrit (1857); A Tale of Two Cities (1859); Great Expectations (1861); Our Mutual Friend (1865); The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870, unfinished). And then there are the Christmas stories: A Christmas Carol (1843); The Chimes (1845, for 1844 [?!]); The Cricket on the Hearth (1846, for 1845); The Battle of Life (1846); The Haunted Man (1848). Does that help, Sam?  The rest of you, I&apos;ll be right back!  12.39pm: Phew. That was painful to look up. This whole thing is painful. First, you have to sift through this &quot;index&quot; thing (all two books of it), and if you&apos;re unlucky it&apos;ll give you about 17 different references to read, all in different volumes. Most often, the most relevant reference will be the last I try, and usually it&apos;ll take me about a week to find the volume it&apos;s in. I think I need a shower.  12.43pm: I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve noticed, but we&apos;ve updated the picture above, to illustrate my research pain.  12.50pm: My colleague Rob Booth has just popped by to note that by refreshing a Wikipedia page five whole times, he managed to find out the population of Cheshire town, Hartford. It&apos;s 5,500. So 90s.  12.56pm: A big thank you to batcow, who has very kindly answered Lushattic&apos;s question about why Parmesan cheese smells of sick. &quot;It&apos;s Butyric Acid,&quot; says batcow, which is apparently in both parmesan cheese and sick. Cheers batcow. Forget Britannica, I&apos;ll just get you guys to help.  12.59pm: Just to clarify: commenter batcow is not found in both parmesan cheese and sick, but butyric acid is. Sorry for the confusion.  1.01pm: MaxtonWalker was asking earlier about whether Queen Victoria ever played bass for Led Zeppelin. Unfortunately, Britannica&apos;s a bit equivocal about this. There&apos;s no rock reference in Vic&apos;s bio, and no entry at all for Led Zeppelin, so I can&apos;t confirm or deny anything as yet. I&apos;ll have a look at the Biographical Dictionary upstairs in a minute.  1.12pm: I&apos;ve just been to the library again to research QuetzalcoatlUK&apos;s question about whether the slum Tom-All-Alone (featured in Dickens&apos; Bleak House) was based on a real area of London. Interesting place, the library. Quite quiet. No search terms, unlike Wikipedia, and everything is arranged alphabetically. Weird. More significantly, Quetzalcoatl, I&apos;m afraid it contained little literary criticism, so I can&apos;t shed any light on Tom-All-Alone. Can anyone else give Quetzalcoatl a hand? Cheers.  1.18pm: By the way, over on Comment is Free, there&apos;s now a poll asking whether you miss Wikipedia or not. I have voted &quot;yes&quot;.  1.21pm: And just to recap, here&apos;s a great animation explaining what Wikipedia are protesting about.  1.25pm: Interesting question earlier from Channel Four Food. They asked: &quot;how do you boil an egg?&quot; I&apos;m probably the wrong person to ask, but I usually just boil the water in a saucepan, then plop the egg in for roughly three minutes forty five seconds, and then dig it out with a ladle.  1.38pm: I can never find the right volume.  1.38pm: This is crazy. Apparently Nelson Mandela is still in jail? That&apos;s what the book says, anyway.  1.46pm: Right. Just off for five minutes to grab a sandwich, so I&apos;ll leave you with a few quickfire answers. Check for accuracy. jonesthescribe: &quot;What was the population of the USSR as your copy of the Encyclopaedia Britannica went to press?&quot; Answer: 285,796,000. Cryogenic: &quot;When was the dawning of the Age of Aquarius?&quot; Answer: 1997. kaff: &quot;How will I be able to do my homework???&quot; Answer: With difficulty. With an immense amount of difficulty. AprilMiles: &quot;Who would win in a fight; tiger or crocodile?&quot; Answer: Crocodile. Josifer: &quot;Why don&apos;t you pass the time by playing solitaire?&quot; Answer: It&apos;s not on my computer.  1.56pm: I&apos;m back. And I&apos;ve just had it confirmed that printed encyclopaedias have no cut-and-paste facility. Bizarre.  2.01pm: Currently investigating which medical student&apos;s diary contained the earliest known instructions for playing golf, following a question from commenter PaxGrass.  I think the answer&apos;s in volume 5. Thing is, I have no idea where that is.  2.05pm: Oh I give up. Can&apos;t find volume 5. Sorry PaxGrass. And sorry to anyone else who wants info relating to things beginning with &quot;G&quot;, pre- or post-1989. But, PaxGrass, as a consolation I&apos;ve looked up something else you were after: the 39 steps. I can non-exclusively reveal that they are a flight of, er, 39 steps that descend a cliff in Kent, and were featured in John Buchan&apos;s adventure novel of the same name, which was later adapted into an eponymous film by Alfred Hitchcock.  2.17pm: My colleague Joanna Geary wanted to know which British newspaper had the biggest circulation in 1989, and what that circulation was. Britannica is not too forthcoming on that score, I&apos;m afraid, but it did impart the following:  Despite earlier fears of possible damage from competition by radio and, later, television, many newspapers have proved to be still attractive to consumers and hence profitable. Newspapers have, for instance, retained their importance as vehicles for advertising.  Good to know!  2.32pm: A charming request from commenter Sharonodea:   My favourite Wikipedia article is Minor Characters In Father Ted. Reading a list of all the priests ever to feature in the show, and what they did, never fails to lift my spirits when I&apos;m feeling down. Can your Encyclopedia Britannica offer me anything similarly cheering?  Very happy to help, Sharonodea. How about something from Probability Theory, which starts on page 132 of volume 26:  It will occur that a knowledge of the coefficients &quot;wK&quot; can be made tantamount to a knowledge of the square of the absolute value of the wave function - i.e., the solution of the central equation of quantum mechanics. Thus it may be expected that some analytic structure of the quantum-mechanical wave function is essential to obtain the successive state values of a classical mechanical system.  Lovely.  2.35pm: My colleague James Ball informs me that I&apos;ve mixed up two different Britannica collections: Ready Reference, and Knowledge in Depth. Profound apologies in advance to the librarians, if that&apos;s the case. I know not what I do.  2.47pm: Just to recap, in case you&apos;re only joining me now (slowcoaches!): I am Wikipedia. Or should I say, Guardipedia. The online reference library is down today, in protest at proposed US anti-piracy legislation, and so, as a replacement resource to all stricken students and journalists, I am answering as many factual questions as I can. As I was saying earlier, a senior colleague has informed me of something called the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which seems to be some sort of paper book (woah!) containing all sorts of facts.  The only problem is that it was published in 1989, and doesn&apos;t seem to contain anything in the way of recent information.  So, if you&apos;ve any pre-89 voids in your factual repetoire, let me know, and I&apos;ll do my best.  2.54pm: Currently working on a request from commenter Charliemij, who asks:   what are the three different ways in which a green sea turtle breath? And does it apply to all turtle species, or just Chelonia mydas?  Will be right back.  2.57pm: By the by, great spot from PaxGrass in the comments, who notes that Wikipedia have exempted their SOPA and PIPA pages from the blackout. SOPA and PIPA are the US anti-piracy acts Wikipedia is protesting about.  3.13pm: Blimey, Charliemij - that was a tough one. Britannica seems to suggest that turtles can breathe through both their lungs, and their bottoms - AND through tissues at the back of their throat. Am I right? From the wording of your question, you sound like someone who knows their turtles.  3.19pm: Bbano asks about Maria Moliner, who is:   the amazing woman who wrote a whole 2 volumes of the first and definitive dictionary of Spanish usage in her living room over 15 years using library cards, a board balanced on two chairs to organise it and a portable typewriter, while working full time and having a family.  Bbano, I&apos;m afraid you know considerably more about Maria than Britannica does. Apologies.  3.24pm: Pertinent question from llamala: how tall is a mountain? &quot;I think it&apos;s 300m but a mate has said it&apos;s 3000ft. Which is correct?&quot; You are, llamala. A mountain is a landmass taller than 1000ft, or just over 300m.  3.33pm: Bit of a stinker from lamid, who asks:  What are the names of the four stomachs of a cow?  An easy one, you might think, but Britannica rejects the terms of the question. Viz:  Actually, the first three of these chambers (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) are thought to be derived from the esophagus ... Slowly the products of microbial action, and some of the microbes themselves move into the cow&apos;s true stomach and intestine ...  And frustratingly, the name of this &quot;true stomach&quot; isn&apos;t mentioned. Soz.  3.53pm: Right. Shoot me, but I&apos;ve got to go. I know this has been a huge resource to you all, and I&apos;ve certainly learnt a lot (namely: what an index is, what the 90s was like, and something about cows) - but, like all good things, Guardipedia must sadly come to an end. If you still need facts, I suggest you wait until tomorrow, when a certain website returns. In the meantime, sate your quest for knowledge with this great animation about anti-piracy laws, and tune into our US liveblog, for full updates on the Great Internet Blackout.  Lastly, massive thanks to my colleague Hannah Waldram, who has been playing a blinder below the line.",

    "text": "At the heart of the wood, where the broad rides crossed, was the hunter&apos;s chair. Like an umpire&apos;s perch or a lifeguard&apos;s tower, the plastic bucket seat was set on top of an aluminium frame. It sheltered under an ash that sent the occasional leaf spinning to earth, marking the fall of autumn. The chair had a grandstand view down three lines of the cross, a clear sight of the partings in the vegetation, the slip roads that brought an animal out of the trees and into the line of fire. Nobody would be shooting this morning. A plank had been padlocked over the ladder rungs preventing all access. Facing east, this was an insect&apos;s sun deck. Two common darter dragonflies, wings spread, sat like aircraft on the solar runway, fuelling up. I was able to lean disrespectfully close to the lower of the two, so close that I could see into the gauze of its compound eyes. The bulbous head on its pin-thin neck gave a yes-no-maybe shake. Nothing else moved, except for the tip of its drumstick abdomen, which beat a silent rhythm, dabbing, but never quite touching the wood. The legs straightened, the insect flew. Along the ride edges, spiders crouched in wait among the long grass, but could not hide their dew-drenched webs. One with a caraway seed for a body had strung its sagging silk over the candelabra flowerhead of a hogweed plant. Others low down worked on a more is better principle, having sprayed out dense white meshes with no recognisable structure. On the crossroads itself, droplets of water glistened like fairy lights on the silk threads of a garden spider&apos;s orb web. The owner held fast in the middle, a brown crusader with a white cross on her back. She sat immobile, head lowered out of sight under a giant body beaded with condensation. I stepped forward cautiously, but must have triggered a guy rope, for the web suddenly twanged and now I was pulling her strings. She scuttled, stopped and settled once more, to resume her long game of patience.",

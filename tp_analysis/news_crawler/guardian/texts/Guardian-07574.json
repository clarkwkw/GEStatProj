    "text": "Over the last three nights the Perseid meteor shower has been creating a great display.  As Earth ploughs through the debris stream left by a giant comet that has been circling the sun since the birth of the solar system, fragments hit the atmosphere to create an incandescent display  and Guardian readers have been capturing the sight in the early hours of the morning. There&apos;s still one day left of the meteor shower and Stuart Clark explains how best to see the spectacle here and find out how you can share your pictures with us here. Your sightings so far                  Some readers have also been tweeting and commenting about what they&apos;ve seen so far: Reading on mobile?

Just saw 6 meteors in the last 10 minutes. 3 absolutely spectacular #gdnmeteor Look to the right of cassiopeia the 'W' one #expertadvice&mdash; Peter Wilson (@ROTEDESIGN) August 10, 2012   beadleclaw writes:  It was a bit cloudy last night but I did catch two or three in half an hour so I was quite pleased. Mrs claw didn&apos;t want to sit out in the cold and stayed in. Afterwards we looked out of the window to describe where I&apos;d seen them  and she saw one straight away. Fun fun fun   thea1mighty adds:  I had two attempts to watch the Perseids this morning, the first attempt it was too cloudy but the second attempt was much better. The sky was mostly cloudless, so I gazed up for about half an hour. Nothing. Then I thought &apos;come on you miserable skies, give me something to wish on&apos; and lo and behold, a few seconds later a silver spark streaking from right to left almost horizontally across the sky. Not sure if wishing for a star to wish on invalidates a fresh wish, only time can tell. Hope the skies are a little busier tonight.

    "text": "Google Glass glasses will be manufactured in the United States, an example of manufacturing returning from the far east to the west, according to reports The manufacturing will be carried out by Hon Hai Precision Industry, the Taiwanese company better known as Foxconn at a factory in Santa Clara, California, according to the Financial Times. Google&apos;s plans follow Apple&apos;s intention to invest $100m (66m) in American manufacturing and President Barack Obama&apos;s stated desire to see more American manufacturing, Google glasses, known as Project Glass, are wearable computers, with cameras and voice recognition which connect to the internet via a smart phone. Google will give 8,000 people the opportunity to pay 1,000 to buy protoypes in the coming weeks with general sale expected by the end of the year. The small scale and experimental nature of the manufacturing makes it desirable to base production in California to allow constant monitoring and updating. Initially, the numbers produced will be small. If the product is a success, they could be mass produced in China. Components will be produced in Asia but assembled in California. Neither Foxconn or Google would comment on the reports.",

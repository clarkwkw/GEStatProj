    "text": "A report by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), an independent watchdog set up to scrutinise the UK government&apos;s aid spending, has raised concerns about the financial management of British development projects in Afghanistan. The UK&apos;s planned annual expenditure on bilateral aid to Afghanistan from 2011 to 2015 is 178m, with the money allocated to four areas: governance and security, education, wealth creation and humanitarian assistance. In carrying out its review, ICAI focused on 10 programmes deemed to be broadly representative of the Department for International Development&apos;s (DfID) aid portfolio in the country. The report (pdf) gave the Afghanistan aid programme an amber-red mark, signifying that the scheme is &quot;not performing well&quot; and needs &quot;significant improvements&quot;. It found that while programme objectives are clear, DfID&apos;s risk assessments  particularly in relation to the ability of project partners and managing agents to deliver on time and to budget  fail to meet expectations. The study criticised DfID&apos;s financial management measures, which it said left open the possibility that aid would fail to reach its intended beneficiaries, and suggested the department is &quot;not proactive enough in detecting fraud and corruption&quot;. &quot;We acknowledge that DfID has to manage this programme in an extremely complex and challenging environment,&quot; said ICAI chief commissioner Graham Ward. &quot;Our view, however, is that DfID does not give sufficient importance to identifying and managing risks in the design and delivery of programmes in Afghanistan.&quot; The report, entitled The Department for International Development: Programme Controls and Assurance in Afghanistan, makes four recommendations. It says DfID&apos;s funding decisions should be informed by a clear understanding of the balance between the risk of leakage and potential programme benefits. The authors also call for: the deployment of staff with stronger financial and procurement skills; more effective liaison between DfID and those delivering the projects; and the implementation, by DfID&apos;s Afghanistan office, of National Audit Office (pdf) and public accounts committee recommendations (pdf) on fraud and corruption (pdf). &quot;UK support in Afghanistan is playing a key role in improving the lives of people who remain amongst the poorest in the world, helping to get children into school and improving healthcare,&quot; said UK development secretary Andrew Mitchell. &quot;We accept that in such a challenging environment there are always things we can do better.&quot; The report, published on Thursday, comes at a time when the tension between domestic austerity measures and foreign aid spending is the subject of close scrutiny. It is likely to provide a focal point for further debate about UK aid only a month after Mitchell was forced to defend British aid commitments to India in a speech at Chatham House. The simultaneous publication of two further ICAI reports will do little to allay government unease about the potential public backlash caused by aid spending. A review entitled Girl Hub: a DfID and Nike Foundation Initiative concludes that a programme designed to give adolescent girls a firmer footing on the development agenda has had little measurable impact to date. Suggesting that the project has been undermined by &quot;shortcomings in planning and governance&quot;, the ICAI identifies a need to improve the scheme&apos;s risk, governance and financial management measures, urging a fresh assessment of its sustainability. A third report, focusing on the effectiveness of DfID&apos;s engagement with the World Bank, acknowledges the efficacy of the relationship between the two bodies while highlighting scope for improvement. &quot;We believe that DfID engages effectively with the bank but that it could do more to help to drive improvements in the cost-effectiveness and performance of the bank&apos;s projects,&quot; said Ward. &quot;This government set up the aid watchdog to scrutinise what we do and how we spend British aid money,&quot; added Mitchell. &quot;These reports do just that, and we will now use ICAI&apos;s findings to make sure UK aid has an even greater impact around the world.&quot; The trio of ICAI reports follow a study by the watchdog last November suggesting that the rapid expansion of the UK&apos;s international aid programme has left it increasingly at risk from corruption and fraud.",

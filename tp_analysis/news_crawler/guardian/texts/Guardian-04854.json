    "text": "   Meshack Mnyawasa, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    Sustainable development is all about a long development plan of the country. The education sector is better now compared with 20 years ago, though there are big challenges, particularly the increases in pupil numbers. The availability of teaching equipment has been increasing at a low rate because of the big number of pupils and high prices that make it difficult for the government to meet. I don&apos;t know much about Rio+20. The best thing to help poor countries is to cancel this kind of meeting and direct the money to poverty-stricken countries instead. Will Rio make any difference to my life? Not at all.",

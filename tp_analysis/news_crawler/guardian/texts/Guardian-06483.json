    "text": "Guatemala has launched what publishers claim is central America&apos;s first braille newspaper. Together with Prociegos, the committee for blind and deaf people in Guatemala, Publinews  a Guatemalan version of the Metro  produced 2,500 copies of the freesheet, which were distributed to blind and visually impaired people throughout the country. The project, financed by four businesses, will continue as a free monthly with the aim of providing its target audience with access to news and current affairs. Publinews hopes to build on its experience in Chile, where it launched Latin America&apos;s first braille newspaper two years ago. &quot;It&apos;s important for visually impaired people to have access to different forms of communication and to feel a part of society,&quot; says Edilzar Castro Quiroz, director of education at Prociegos. &quot;They have the same human rights as everyone else and should be granted them by the state.&quot; Prociegos estimates that more than 110,000 people in Guatemala live with a visual disability; in rural parts of the country, where access to medical care and special resources are limited, the problem is magnified. Jorge Mario Cifuentes lost his sight 20 years ago. He was diagnosed with pigmented retinopathy and is now sports and recreation programme co-ordinator for Prociegos. &quot;Having a visual impairment in Guatemala, like any other kind of impairment, is very difficult,&quot; says Cifuentes. &quot;Most institutions that deal with this issue are private, and the state&apos;s reaction to this subject is very limited, especially on the theme of education. For me to be able to hold a newspaper in braille is a reflection that society is gaining an awareness of the needs of blind people.&quot; About eight months ago, Publinews started working with focus groups to find out what articles and sections would be of most interest to visually impaired people, tailoring the content accordingly. The braille newspaper has the same 16-page format as the Publinews daily, but features articles catering to the interests of blind people. Prociegos says the newspaper opens a door to blind people to contribute by writing articles and helping with the production process. &quot;The visually impaired community had been a little forgotten about, and we wanted to support them and prioritise their rights; it&apos;s a little drop of water, but it&apos;s making a lot of waves,&quot; says Hugo Perez, director of marketing at Publinews. As well as covering the latest international, national, technology and sports news, the paper features an &quot;inspirational person of the month&quot;; the aim is to motivate other blind people to achieve their potential. This month the focus is on Brandon Aspuac, an athlete who will be representing Guatemala in the 800m and 1500m at the Paralympic Games in London this summer. The project has had such a positive response in Guatemala that Prociegos is in talks about performing an encore in El Salvador. Sonia Hernandez works as a telephone operator at Prociegos. &quot;I&apos;ve always been a fan of the news and enjoy reading more than listening,&quot; she says. &quot;I used to listen to the radio at work, but it was difficult as the phone would ring and I&apos;d lose the thread of the story. When they first gave me this braille edition, I just sat down right then and there and devoured it. I&apos;m really happy with it. It&apos;s a normal newspaper that speaks about national and international issues  the only difference is that it&apos;s in braille.&quot; Though Prociegos estimates each copy of the newspaper is read by five to eight people, there is an obvious need  acknowledged by Publinews and Prociegos  to address the publication&apos;s limited print run and frequency. Finding new backing is the first step to improving circulation, and Castro Quiroz is optimistic. &quot;It&apos;s caught the attention of different businesses and investors. In the short term, it will continue as a monthly. But since its first publication we have had more businesses show an interest in supporting the project  international and national companies.&quot;",

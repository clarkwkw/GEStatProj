    "text": "Across the medieval New Bridge from sunny Gunnislake, dark plantations on the Devon side show few signs of spring. The sugary smell of resin wafts among conifers where shafts of morning sun enhance the lurid greenery of mosses and woodrush. Birdsong echoes in the lighter glades and around deciduous trees entwined with the fresh growth of honeysuckle and underlain with bluebell leaves. No tree-surfers venture on the rope and plank bridges suspended between sunlit tree tops, but three men are out on a training run along the track of the old mineral railway. Now restored as a leisure trail, it carried wagons of copper ore from Devon Great Consols to Morwellham Quay, winding through cuttings, along embankments above the river and then down an incline for eventual loading on to ships. The track overlooks a terrace of miners&apos; cottages built between 1850 and 1860 by the Duke of Bedford (who owned all the land and mineral rights) at a cost of 22 each and rented out at 1s 3d to 2s 6d a week. In the far distance, peeping above the horizon, Sharptor on Bodmin Moor is misted with another shower and, further along the trail, from high up on Pleasure Rock, the Tamar comes into view  brown and swollen after last night&apos;s rain, with scum swirling down the middle. The precipitous river cliffs, including Morwell and Chimney rocks, give dramatic views across the river and have long been destinations for walks and picnics. In Victorian times viewers would have gazed down on steamboats bringing sightseers up to view the weir. Here too was the boatyard at Netstakes, on a ledge of land on the opposite side. Ocean-going schooners were built there in the 1860s for local shareholders and launched for the 20-mile journey down the winding river to the open sea.",

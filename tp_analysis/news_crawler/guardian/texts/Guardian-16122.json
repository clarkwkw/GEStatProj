    "text": "   Photograph: supplied    The biggest impact of being unfunded is not being able to fully focus on my research. Between my job, the PhD, volunteering, and attempting to have a life, my head is in many places at once and it feels like I never quite switch off. That does have an impact on my personal life. Embarking on a PhD I had left a job that I really enjoyed and was unsure of what to do next. Having only ever wanted to be a barrister, and deciding that wasn&apos;t going to happen, I felt lost. It was at this point I started volunteering with young people who were involved in the justice system and completing activities in the community. The coming together of these two sets of circumstances motivated me to start my PhD. I am currently looking at what impact restorative justice has on reducing reoffending in young people. I had a question that I wanted to answer. This was, and still is, my motivation. I looked at a number of funded PhD posts but did not find any that worked. I decided that I would complete my PhD part time and work alongside to fund my fees. I work full time in administration on compressed hours which gives me one day a week to concentrate on my research. Sleep has been on my wish list for a long time. By working, I can pay for fees and the mortgage. I search for funding on a regular basis. There are some possibilities for small grants but so far nothing that will allow me to research full time. It&apos;s disappointing, but I knew that funding was unlikely when I started. Motivating yourself Working a nine hour day and then studying even more can be challenging. It&apos;s difficult to get the balance right between my research and employment. I do worry about this as I like to do a good job and don&apos;t want to feel like I&apos;m not giving 100%. However, I am genuinely interested in my subject and that keeps me going. I think supervision is important for motivation. I am remarkably lucky to have a supervision team who are supportive, encouraging, and keep me to deadlines. My husband is behind me all the way. He does everything in the house, supports me financially and brings me coffee when I&apos;m working. Support networks are important to get you through a PhD. Being unfunded limits the opportunities available to you purely due to time pressures. To raise my profile, I take on experiences that I can fit around work. I&apos;ve presented at a student symposium and been offered teaching experience at the university. As my research progresses, I hope to be able to present at conference  for which I will need to take annual leave from my work  but it&apos;s a worthwhile investment. Advice for others I would advise unfunded PhD students to plan and plan again. Make yourself deadlines and stick to them. Work out whether you want to achieve a total amount of time researching in any given week when planning. Make use of opportunities outside your PhD that you&apos;re able to attend, as it will help you in the long run. And finally, remember that you&apos;re creating something original and unique. It will be worth it in the end. Natacha Harding is a PhD student studying criminology at the University of Winchester This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

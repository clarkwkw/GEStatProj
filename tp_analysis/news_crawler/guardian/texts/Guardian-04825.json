    "text": "When Capcom produced its first Marvel-themed fighting game  X-Men: Children of the Atom  back in 1994, the company knew it would have to take the rule book, tear it up, throw it out of the window and then order a thermo-nuclear strike on it.  Although the Street Fighter titles have always offered outlandish special moves, a fighting game based around super heroes would have to take that to a whole new level of pixellated insanity. They are super heroes, dammit. Hence, screen-filling super combos, bizarre environments and lusciously extravagant animation. The recipe was a success, ensuring an ongoing partnership between Marvel and Capcom that has produced some of the wildest fight-&apos;em-ups ever devised. Now, Mortal Kombat creator NetherRealm Studios is taking the same approach with Injustice: Gods Among Us, a traditional 3D fighting game, based around the DC universe. Except traditional isn&apos;t quite the right word, because Injustice is, well, insane.  Naturally, players can select from a huge range of DC goodies and baddies, each with their own characteristic animations and special moves. Superman hovers above the ground using his raw strength to pound enemies, backing up his melee might with laser vision. Flash on the other hand is weaker but super agile, able to get in dozens of killer blows before the other guy has swung his fist. Elsewhere, Batman has a vast range of gadgets to call upon, slinging batarangs across the fighting stage and using his cape as a shield; the horrendous Solomon Grundy is a pounding wall of fists and power, who&apos;ll occasionally reach for one of the knives or cleavers embedded in his back to attack his foe with it.      Injustice: Gods Among Us    Every fighter is rendered in rather lovely detail. Faces screw up with effort or rage, while clothing wrinkles and capes flutter amid the carnage. They all have their own entry and winning animations too, and these are entertainingly histrionic, capturing the divergent personalities of the roster. The madness of the game, howeve,r lies in its brilliantly interactive environments. Every zone from Batman&apos;s cave to Superman&apos;s Fortress of Solitude is cluttered with stuff you can grab, press and throw people through. In Batman&apos;s home, you can smash display cabinets to grab grenades, or jab a big red button on a control panel to fire up the Batmobile&apos;s jet thrusters just as your opponent is standing in their blast radius (the button, by the way, is in the corner of the screen, usually the worst place for a fighter to end up  NetherRealm is actively subverting the conventions of the genre).  In the Future City arena, Batman is able to smash Grundy&apos;s head into a car  a move that the giant later counters by simply picking up the car and swatting the Dark Knight across the screen with it. It&apos;s knockabout stuff, but the implementation is smooth and looks to integrate well into the combat mechanic. Each environment also has around three different areas that players can chuck each other into, the combat continuing seamlessly. My favourite section is in the Batcave where you can shove a foe into an elevator and follow him in, prompting the door to close behind them  we then get an animation of the lift rising, the walls and ceiling being punched out from within as the fight continues unseen  a nice little cartoon touch.     Injustice: Gods Among Us    Better yet are the game&apos;s astonishingly extravagant super moves, charged up throughout a bout. Flash has a mega-punch which he powers up by running around the entire world; Superman can punch an opponent into space, fly up after him and punch him back down to Earth. In our E3 demo, the fight between Batman and Grundy features several exchanges where the characters are punched through the walls and floors of a skyscraper.  It&apos;s not, as you may have gathered, a subtle game  and the amount of pleasure derived from these chaotic, highly destructive special moves will depend on how solid the underlying fighting engine. X-Men Children of the Atom and Capcom&apos;s subsequent Marvel titles have all worked because the outlandishness is pegged to a robust fighting system with lots of hidden intricacies  Injustice will need to do the same.  But this was one of the most entertaining demos I attended at E3, helped by the fact that I was in a session with notoriously enthusiastic US blogger Hip-Hop Gamer, who whooped and cheered so extravagantly through the entire demo I feared he might have some sort of breakdown. Luckily, we all got out alive, most of us wondering what it will feel like to piledrive Superman through 12 floors of an office block. We&apos;ll have to wait until next year to find out.  Injustice: Gods Among Us is released on Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii U in 2013",

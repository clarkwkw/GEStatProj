    "text": "Freya Berry, an English literature student at Cambridge University     Freya Berry, student blogger Photograph: Guardian     I&apos;ll admit it  non-vocational, non-scientific degrees are increasingly hard to justify. I&apos;ve endlessly dragged out all the counter arguments  that we&apos;re learning for learning&apos;s sake, that arts students are taught how to think and analyse. Maybe I should just relish the thought that while I sit around reading, engineers build bridges from matchsticks and the medics try to sit through their first cadaver session without being sick. If I&apos;m honest, the real reason I assumed that reading books would lead to a job was because I could. My middle-class upbringing showed me nothing of unemployment or poverty. So when I was 18 and started applying for university  and when tuition fees were 3,000 a year  I had the luxury of choosing a degree based on my interests rather than employment prospects. Lucky me. Putting yourself in hock to the tune of 9,000, no matter how sophisticated the payback options, is something people  and especially poorer people  are justified in being afraid of. I don&apos;t buy David Willetts&apos; insistence that this demographic will not be affected. It&apos;s a lot easier for the middle classes to declare we want to fanny around with books for three years, while the minds at the lower end of the economic spectrum get squeezed out. There&apos;s a lot of talk about the &quot;best and the brightest&quot; from the working classes being encouraged to apply to top universities. What about the mediocre? The middle classes abound in such people. I&apos;ve watched them scoot through to a mid-2:1 at Oxbridge and other Russell Group universities  and go on to perform mediocrely at management consultancies to the less-than-mediocre tune of 35,000 a year. University fees won&apos;t push out those who consistently perform excellently, from whatever background. They&apos;ll prevent poorer candidates who simply do ok, and would go on doing ok, from finding their niche. These are the ones who will be scared off, or told to avoid, higher education  by their parents, or their schools, or themselves. In the meantime, the Tim nice-but-dims of this world will continue to perpetuate the same old socially immobile cycle. Today, it&apos;s those of average intelligence, but less-than-average income, who are the true losers in education.  Anya Hancock, a prospective English student     Anya Hancock Photograph: Guardian    It&apos;s hardly surprising that fewer people are willing to study arts and humanities subjects when it costs up to 9k to do so. I was nervous about picking English when I filled in my Ucas form this year. While on the one hand it&apos;s extremely competitive, many question the subject&apos;s value.  English isn&apos;t a vocational course, but it can open plenty of career paths  from publishing to finance and marketing. Teaching, once the stopgap profession for English graduates, now has highly competitive fast track teaching schemes with exciting career paths for well-qualified graduates. The biggest setback facing students who want to study a degree in the arts is that there are now far fewer places than before. The government&apos;s investment in &quot;priority&quot; subjects such as medicine, science and technology has been made at the expense of funding for arts-based courses  the number of arts and humanities courses available at universities has dropped 14% since 2006, according to a report by the University and College Union (UCU). Some universities that offer only arts-based courses have seen their public funding cut completely. Although they remain open, there is less choice and more competition. Categorising subjects as &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;non-priority&quot; is incredibly unfair. English literature remains an over-subscribed course: entry requirements are unlikely to dip below AAB for universities at the higher end of the league tables. Such tough competition for places suggests that students don&apos;t see it as a &quot;non-priority&quot; subject at all.",

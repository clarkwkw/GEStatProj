    "text": "World leaders are to face a &quot;very powerful&quot; challenge to agree to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, David Cameron said as he hailed a tentative agreement by a UN high-level panel to a new set of development targets after 2015. Speaking in New York after the final meeting of the panel, co-chaired by Cameron, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, the prime minister said its members had &quot;nailed&quot; their colours to the mast on the need to eradicate extreme poverty. But Cameron did not say whether the panel, whose final report is due to be presented to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, this month, will include other &quot;zero&quot; targets, such as eradicating hunger. The prime minister sounded an upbeat note as he hailed the agreement on extreme poverty. He said: &quot;We have brought this all together in what will be a very powerful report for the world to respond to  We have nailed our colours to the mast, with one clear overarching aim  to end extreme poverty. &quot;Over a billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day. Getting to the point where no one at all is that poor is no longer a pipe dream. It can and should be one of the great achievements of our time. And it means that by 2030 everyone will have what we in Britain already consider our birthright  drinking water, electricity, healthcare and a place at school.&quot; Ban established the panel in July to draw up a framework for development after the millennium development goals (MDGs) expire in 2015. Many countries are unlikely to meet the MDGs. Cameron, who had hoped to unveil 10 new development goals in New York, made clear that further work is needed. His 10 goals are: ending extreme poverty, ending hunger, safe and sustainable water supplies, stopping preventable deaths, a school place for every child, empowering girls and women, delivering infrastructure and energy, boosting jobs, ensuring access to justice, and effective and open government. The prime minister said the MDGs had been &quot;historic&quot;. But he indicated that they were flawed because there was insufficient focus on the causes of poverty. Cameron said: &quot;They weren&apos;t perfect. There wasn&apos;t enough focus on the devastating effects of conflict and violence. They overlooked the importance of strong institutions and accountable government. &quot;So we have agreed that there must be a transformational shift in the way we do things. Rich countries meeting their aid commitments is important, but will not be enough on its own. &quot;Our report will make clear that we need to tackle the causes of poverty, not just the symptoms. Above all: a focus on economic growth driven by a strong private sector as the most powerful engine to lift people out of poverty; a recognition that development has to be sustainable for the planet in the long term; and a new commitment to strong institutions and governance, because these are essential to end conflict, protect the rule of law, stamp out corruption and insecurity, and hold governments accountable.&quot; The prime minister said the need to focus on the causes of poverty explains why Britain has been resisting pressure to place a commitment to reduce income inequality in the developing world in the panel&apos;s report. He said: &quot;We want to make a more equal and fair world. We want to have equality of opportunity right throughout the goals we set  whether it is about healthcare, whether it is about education. &quot;That is the most important form of equality that we need in our world  that frankly no one is left behind, everyone is given the chance to live a life out of poverty and make the most of their talents and their opportunities. It is that equality of opportunity that you will see flow through this very, very strong report.&quot; Yudhoyono and Johnson Sirleaf did not attend the press conference.",

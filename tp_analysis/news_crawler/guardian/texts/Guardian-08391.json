    "text": "As part of the London Games Festival, The Guardian will be hosting an event on 2 October, aimed at budding games journalists  or those just interested in writing about entertainment in the digital era. It&apos;ll also be useful for indie games developers who want to find out what makes journalists tick, or perhaps just want to throw rotten vegetables at us while yelling insults. Taking place in the Guardian office at Kings Place, our panel discussion will feature me and fellow Guardian games contributors Simon Parkin and Christian Donlan, who also write for the likes of Eurogamer and Edge Magazine. We&apos;ll be joined by IGN features editor Keza MacDonald and another couple of veteran writers, bloggers and video presenters.  We&apos;ll look at the tricky business of getting into writing professionally, as well as providing a few tips on style and getting your ideas commissioned. And it&apos;s all free! Tickets are available on a first come, first served basis. You can apply right here.",

But in Israel, they are using a land-based alternative in the form of the Guardian UGV autonomous off-road vehicle.  No association with this organisation, we should say. (Thanks @rubbernuke for the link.) Why is Google not supporting the Open Document Formats? &gt;&gt; Muktware  Google was one of the supporters of ODF and it was expected that it will fully support ODF formats. Let&apos;s see how is Google supporting ODF across its products including Android, Chrome OS and Google Docs (the direct competitor to Microsoft Office).  Yes, let&apos;s. (Thanks @sputnikkers for the link.) Google Research: most of the time, the smartphone you search for is the smartphone you buy &gt;&gt; Product Launch Buzz From November 2012, but still relevant:   Google has just posted research findings on how certain factors affect the launch of a smartphone, with data coming directly from search. According to author Matt Seitz, the senior analytical lead at the Google Agency Blog, searches predict smartphone sales &quot;with over 90 percent correlation throughout the launch cycle.&quot; With this data, the search giant has uncovered the most important factors that determine whether or not a smartphone will launch into the arms of millions of adoring fans, or to an audience that either doesn&apos;t know the phone exists or simply doesn&apos;t care.  Apple looks to protect dropped iPhones by shifting their orientation mid-flight &gt;&gt; Apple Insider  Finally, the system requires a mechanism to either reorientate the device while in flight, or otherwise protect certain sensitive device components in the event of a fall. Here, the patent calls for a number of solutions, including the movement of a weighted mass within the device, a means to &quot;grip a plug&quot; to prevent a freefall, lift foils that can be extended out from the surface of a device, and a thrust mechanism such as a can of gas, among other countermeasures.  Er.. OK. Pentagon swears it isn&apos;t abandoning BlackBerries for iOS devices &gt;&gt; Wired.com  Big caveat: the Pentagon&apos;s new &quot;mobility&quot; plan may lead troops and Pentagon civilians to get secured Apple smartphones and tablets. Ditto for Android devices. And Windows devices. &quot;And let&apos;s not leave RIM out of that picture&quot;, John Hickey, the mobility program manager for the Defense Information Systems Agency, told reporters last month.  If he was speaking last month, ie February, hadn&apos;t he heard that it&apos;s not RIM any more, it&apos;s BlackBerry? Chatbot wears down proponents of anti-science nonsense &gt;&gt; MIT Technology Review From November 2010:   Nigel Leck, a software developer by day, was tired of arguing with anti-science crackpots on Twitter. So, like any good programmer, he wrote a script to do it for him. The result is the Twitter chatbot @AI_AGW. Its operation is fairly simple: Every five minutes, it searches twitter for several hundred set phrases that tend to correspond to any of the usual tired arguments about how global warming isn&apos;t happening or humans aren&apos;t responsible for it. It then spits back at the twitterer who made that argument a canned response culled from a database of hundreds. The responses are matched to the argument in question  tweets about how Neptune is warming just like the earth, for example, are met with the appropriate links to scientific sources explaining why that hardly constitutes evidence that the source of global warming on earth is a warming sun.  Unfortunately, the account seems to have been suspended. Boo. Logitech Harmony Touch Review &gt;&gt; AllThingsD Bonnie Cha:   I&apos;ve been using the Harmony Touch for the past week, and there&apos;s a lot to like about the remote. Setup is easy. The touchscreen provides one-touch access to 50 of your favorite channels, and you can use gestures to perform various tasks. That said, it also poses some problems. Due to the location of the remote&apos;s 2.4in display, some key buttons are placed out of easy reach. Those who like physical buttons might also take issue with the remote&apos;s reliance on the touchscreen for things like entering channel numbers. But the biggest hurdle may be its expensive $250 price tag. At this point, the touchscreen is a nice-to-have feature, not a must-have, so it&apos;s not worth the extra cost.  If you ever needed proof of the ocean between hardware companies - which solve problems by adding more buttons (or touch screens) - and software companies, which solve problems by repurposing features and adapting to the user, here it is. Also: $250?? Post &quot;Good Google&quot;, who will defend the open web? &gt;&gt; Fogbeam Labs Philip Rhodes:   Sadly, there are not a lot of obvious candidates. One wonders, who else has the clout to do it now, as well as the motivation? Does anybody see Marissa moving Yahoo that way? I&apos;m guessing &quot;no&quot; but would love to be proven wrong. Yahoo *have* done some pro Open Web things in the past, but even if they had the inclination, I&apos;m not sure they have the clout to do a lot, especially since they don&apos;t even run their own search engine anymore. It won&apos;t be Microsoft, you can bet on that. They have been notoriously inimical towards Open Standards, Open Source, and pretty much &quot;Open Anything&quot; for most of their history. And I haven&apos;t seen any recent evidence to suggest any fundamental change of heart on their end.  Stop The Cyborgs &quot;Fighting the algorithmic future one bit at a time&quot;.

    "text": "Possibly the biggest tech story of last week was the update of Apple&apos;s iBooks software and with that, the launch of the iBooks textbooks feature, which the company claims will &quot;reinvent textbooks.&quot; The idea is that students will be able to interact with their learning material, create study cards by highlighting text and diagrams that come alive at a touch. Users will also be able to create their own textbooks using iBook Author. The reaction from both the technology and the education communities was swift and emphatic. Mashable&apos;s editor, Lance Ulanoff wrote: &quot;Apple&apos;s plan to bring iPad textbooks to schools across America and around the world via iBooks 2 and iBooks Author is nothing short of a revolution.&quot; While Daniel Nicholls, a tech blogger tweeted: &quot;Hyperbole be damned. Farewell textbooks.&quot; Yet, in the days that have followed, many have focused on iBook Author&apos;s user agreement and expressed concerns about who will own the resources created using Apple&apos;s software. Steve Kovach writes: &quot;Apple is providing you with a free tool that will help you sell your work through their own store. But even though it&apos;s your creation, Apple claims ownership over it simply because you used its app to make it.&quot; Glyn Moody went further in a blog entitled: Apple&apos;s iBooks 2: an attack on educational freedoms. With growing support for open access in higher education, we would like to know what you make of iBooks 2. Do you think iBooks 2 is a victory or a loss for open access in education? Will the technology revolutionise teaching or are, like Jason Gilbert, more reserved about the results? The Huffington Post tech columnist wrote: &quot;It takes a mega-corporation like Apple to shift the conversation and nudge a well-entrenched, multi-billion dollar industry in a proactive direction (just ask the major record labels). And though we shouldn&apos;t imagine that every inner-city elementary school student will be flicking and swiping through the alphabet by late 2012, we should celebrate that, at the very least, the nation at large is discussing - on Twitter, on Facebook and on major television networks - the need for a more technologically-advanced classroom.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

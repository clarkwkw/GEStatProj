    "text": "    This week&apos;s element is cadmium, represented by the atomic symbol, Cd, and the atomic number, 48. It is a ductile silvery metal that is special because it is corrosion resistant. Cadmium once had a variety of uses but because it is highly toxic and readily accumulates in living things, its use is being phased out, although it still is in demand by the electronics industry.    Named for cadmia (also known as calamine), a naturally occurring form of zinc carbonate, cadmium was originally discovered independently and simultaneously by several Germans after heating cadmia. Cadmium is rare in the earth&apos;s crust, but typically co-occurs in zinc ores so it is a common byproduct of zinc production. It sometimes is a byproduct of copper and lead production as well.  Cadmium has a wide number of uses, only a few of which I briefly mention here. For example, it is used in nuclear reactors to absorb neutrons released by nuclear fission; it is a critical component of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries and cadmium-telluride solar panels; it is a stabilizer in PVC and adds fatigue resistance to many solders. Beautiful ... cadmium is well-known to artists and art lovers because it formed the basis for several very popular pigments that range in colour from brilliant yellow, orange, and red through brown, depending upon the proportions of selenium and sulfur that are also added to the paint. Cadmium-based paints were celebrated for their vibrant and long-lasting colours, and the two most popular of these pigments were cadmium red (cadmium selenide) and cadmium yellow (cadmium sulfide). Monet, one of my favourite painters, typically used cadmium yellow pigments, for example. But cadmium is/also was used as a pigment in many other substances, ranging from plastics and rubbers to vitreous enamels.  ... but deadly, cadmium is very toxic like its &quot;big sister&quot;, mercury, which is found immediately below it in the periodic table. Cadmium has no known biological role in most living things, but it mimics the role of its &quot;little sister&quot;, zinc, which is an essential trace element. Cadmium bioaccumulates in a number of food crops, particularly rice, lettuce, spinach, cabbage and turnip. For these reasons, it is important that all cadmium-containing items, such as batteries, are properly disposed of to avoid contaminating the environment.  Cadmium is utilised by the marine diatom, the unicellular microalga Thalassiosira weissflogii, in a cadmium-based carbonic anhydrase enzyme that catalyses the conversion between carbon dioxide and carbonic acid. It apparently has a yet-to-be-discovered biological role in the fly agaric mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which absorbs and concentrates cadmium to high levels, even when growing in cadmium-poor soils.  In vertebrates, cadmium accumulates in the kidneys and to a lesser extent in liver, where it remains for as long as 30 years, causing irreversible damage. Cadmium accumulation causes cancer in some animals, although the link between cadmium and cancer is weak in humans.  If you are a smoker, you should also know that nicotine plants accumulate cadmium in their leaves, which is then transferred to you whilst puffing away. According to a 53-page review of cadmium research that was published in 1998, on average, smokers have 4-5 times higher blood cadmium concentrations and 2-3 times higher kidney cadmium concentrations than do non-smokers [free PDF]. As much as 50% of the inhaled cadmium in a cigarette is absorbed through the lungs and smoking is a significant source of cadmium in humans, especially in the EU, where most other uses of cadmium have been severely reduced or stopped altogether.

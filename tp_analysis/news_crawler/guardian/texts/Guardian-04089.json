    "text": "What youll learnPhilosophy tackles questions and concepts that others tend to take for granted. What is the difference between a reason and a mere rationalisation? What does it actually mean to say that one event causes another? What does it mean to describe some ingredients as natural? What is private property? When can a scientific theory become a scientific fact? Students studying philosophy can also find themselves engaging with modern social and political concerns, while confronting questions of personal value systems, social critique and moral life. Philosophy is a subject to ponder (for example, 2,000 years ago, Pontius Pilate was supposed to have asked the question: What is truth?, and we still havent formed a satisfactory answer), giving students the space to debate the views of others and formulate their own opinions. You can expect to study different thinkers and traditions of thought, from Plato and Aristotle through to Marx, Kant, Nietzsche, Russell and Derrida  philosophers who academics say have helped shape western thought. Modules you are likely to cover include critical reasoning, metaphysics, aesthetics, ethics and political philosophy, as well as the philosophy of science, literature, mind, religion language and maths. Philosophy also addresses questions that most of us think about but have a hard time discussing: Am I really free? What is the meaning of death? Do we ever really know what other people feel or think? Philosophy connects with many other subjects and can be studied as a joint degree, so you could pair it up with history, politics or law, for example, which could offer an interesting focus for your philosophical musings.   interactive   How youll learnYoull be taught mostly through lectures, seminars, and lots of independent work. A good philosophy course teaches you how to think about issues systematically. You will develop important key skills in areas such as oral and written communication, critical reading, constructing and defending an argument, and independent research. What entry requirements youll needEntry requirements vary. The Russell Group universities encourage applications from students who have A-levels (or equivalent) in subjects such as maths, religious studies, classical civilisations or philosophy.    interactive   What job you could doWhatever your future choice of career or sphere of activity, the skills you acquire alongside the intellectual and imaginative challenges you will tackle through your studies will prove incredibly valuable to you in any field. Philosophy develops skills that are highly valued by employers, such as verbal reasoning, creative thinking, presenting a clearly formulated and coherent argument, analysing dense and difficult written material, distinguishing the relevant from the irrelevant, and carrying out independent inquiry. Philosophy graduates pop up in a whole range of fields including consultancy, journalism, publishing and law, local administration, project management, teaching, librarianship, the civil service and banking. And then theres the creative professions. Hollywood is crawling with former philosophers: Bruce Lee, Susan Sarandon, Harrison Ford. The composer Phillip Glass studied philosophy; so did film-maker Joel Coen. The financial sector is another common destination for philosophy students. Studying the philosophy of law could open doors to the legal profession, while business ethics modules could serve you well in the City. Some graduates go on to further study and a career in academia and research. Others undertake further training to become schoolteachers.",

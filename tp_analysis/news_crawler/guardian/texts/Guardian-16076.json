    "text": "Set 20 years after a horrific fungal contagion causes the downfall of society, The Last of Us is a gritty survival drama filled with desperate, flawed and  above all  human characters. As the gruff Joel, much of the game involves guiding the young and vulnerable Ellie to safety. Travelling across a ruined America, Joel and Ellie encounter many other survivors, some of whom present a greater threat than the monstrous infected. Each conflict is tense  you&apos;ll be overrun if typical &quot;action shooter&quot; tactics are attempted. Caution, stealth, listening and forethought are the key weapons. The relationship between the co-leads is the crux of the game, while moments of violence are designed to shock rather than serve as adrenaline-rush exploitation. It is a harsh world players are cast into, one demanding reflection on the brutal actions they&apos;ll be forced to undertake. Between its stunning visuals and emotional core, The Last of Us may prove to be the finest game released this console generation.",

    "text": "I&apos;ve been inundated with interesting and unusual trailers recently, so thought I&apos;d share a bunch with you. It&apos;s a diverse collection, but old school pixel visuals sure are popular these days. Enjoy! Catequesis (Pakarico/Curved Cat, Android, PC, Mac, Linux)            Described as an &apos;indie 8bit survival horror&apos; adventure, Catequesis names Zelda, Deadly Premonition and Lone Survivor among its key influences. It&apos;s a pan-European collaboration between Spanish developer Pakarico and French engine creator Curved Cat, and its appropriation of JPRG visuals is rather lovely. It&apos;s due out this autumn. Dog Sled Saga ( Dan FitzGerald and Lisa Bromie, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS)            I love the style of this dog sled game (whoever saw that coming?), which gets you to build your own team before swooping across the frozen tundra, competing in races and earning money to spend on useful items. From the press release: &quot;The game will cater to fans of The Binding of Isaac, FTL, Spelunky, etc., who enjoy starting from scratch and trying to beat the game as proficiently as possible; but those who want to can also continue to ride with their team beyond the win condition we have in mind, as the game will generate randomised races for an eternity.&quot; An autumn release is lined up, and I&apos;m intrigued by the comparisons to Pokemon (collecting and managing your creatures) and Xcom (building a competitive team).  Paper Titans (Team Lumo/Blitz Games, iOS)            The follow-up to last year&apos;s beautiful cloud game Kumo Lumo is a paper craft adventure featuring a cast of origami characters, all beautifully rendered to give Media Molecule&apos;s Tearaway a run for its (paper) money. The trailer shows the latest addition to the crew, Exploder  see if you can guess what he does. It&apos;s released later this month and you can follow the development blog for more information. Knights of Pen &amp; Paper +1 Edition (Behold Studios/Paradox Interactive, PC, Mac, and Linux)            Originally released on mobile platforms, this really cute &apos;meta RPG&apos; is coming to PC, Mac and Linux this month, complete with new gameplay features. It&apos;s essentially a simulation of playing a table-top role-playing game. Or as the press release puts it: &quot;players control players in-game at the dungeon master&apos;s table  going on adventures with other tablemates and spending their gains to boost their warriors and mages while simultaneously improving the quality of their snacks, gaming table, and sourcebooks.&quot;",

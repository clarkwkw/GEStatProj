    "text": "I pass them every day on my way to the marsh and have completely failed to spot them. Yet they are so much the tannin brown colour of the stark limbs of these oaks, that I can forgive myself the omission. There are two swinging gently at a twig end like some tiny forgotten gnarled fruits. In fact they are known as oak apples, small irregular spheres, similar to acorns in size, but they are no natural product of the tree. Oak apples are galls created by an invasive insect, a type of cynipid wasp that lays eggs inside a leaf bud. The eggs cause the tree to respond vegetatively, and a swollen tuber of hard material accumulates around the wasp larvae. In time the outer shell provides protection for the developing grubs, while the inner tissue supplies their nutrients. When I cut open the abandoned gall its interior unfolds as a mosaic of oval cells where dozens of larvae grew, developed and metamorphosed into adult wasps. These tunnelled out in midsummer and, after mating, they too deposited eggs that caused further gall growths on the oak&apos;s root system. It is within these secondary galls that another generation of asexual adults develops. About this time of year these wingless wasps emerge and climb the trunk in search of fresh leaf buds to begin the next generation of oak apples. What I find most moving about these quiet fragments of our landscape is their venerable heritage. Margaret Redfern in her fabulous new book, Plant Galls, suggests that many gall wasps evolved in the Cretaceous, when flowering plants and herbivorous insects were diversifying. So when one notes an old oak apple swaying on a January breeze, one gets a glimpse not only into the miracle of life that was last summer, but one peers back to an age when the Earth was peopled with reptiles the size of oak trees.",

It has the rectangular slab look of smartphones already on the market.  The hardware varies in the absence of a home button and the inclusion of a red LED light that flashes when a message comes in. According to earlier announcements by [Thorsten] Heins, RIM is also making a model with a physical keyboard.   Steady as she goes. Also: the description of BB10 makes it sound a lot like Windows Phone. iPad mini Display Technology Shoot-Out &gt;&gt; DisplayMate Compared with the Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 screens over a huge range of optical tests. Interesting. (Thanks @rubbernuke for the link.) Texas Instruments to cut 1,700 jobs, shift away from phones &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  Despite having landed its chips in devices such as the Motorola Droid and Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire tablet, TI has now admitted something of defeat.  The company just announced that it will re-focus its OMAP chip business on a wider set of &quot;embedded markets&quot; -- chip industry code for things that aren&apos;t personal computers or in this case wireless phones. The move, it says, offers greater business potential over the long term. Design cycles for the smartphone business are pretty harsh and costly -- and incredibly competitive.  As part of the move, it says it will cut nearly 1,700 jobs, amounting to about 5% of its work force, which it says will reduce annual costs by $450m by the end of next year.  5 big tech issues await Obama in second term &gt;&gt; CNN.com  Technology policy didn&apos;t get much airtime in the 2012 presidential election, but the Obama administration will face serious issues over the next four years.  Satisficers &gt; Maximizers &gt;&gt; Raging Thunderbolt Why do tech people keep talking about &quot;the best&quot;?   These quotes [earlier in the post] all converge on two themes.  Best or Bust. If you are not getting the best, then you are getting something untrustworthy, poor, or low-quality. Bestness = Happiness. If you do try to find and get the best, even at the cost of spending a great deal of time and money, you&apos;ll be happier in the end.  Both are false.   An excellent counterpoint to so much of the willy-waving around &quot;speeds and feeds&quot; tech commentary. Tablet computer added to Queen&apos;s Royal Collection &gt;&gt; BBC News  The Queen will add the first tablet computer to the Royal Collection when she is presented with a &quot;digital time-capsule&quot; later.  The touchscreen device will provide access to videos, photographs and text submitted by participants who have recounted memories from the past 60 years of Queen Elizabeth II&apos;s reign.  150 gigabytes of data was collected.  That is more than can be stored on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Note 10.1, so it has been limited to 60 selected entries...The organisation said it had at one point considered using an Apple iPad, but ultimately opted for Samung&apos;s tablet after discussing the project with both firms.   Couldn&apos;t they have put the rest of the content on an SD card? (Thanks @1sthand and others for the link.) iPad mini creates more demand than it cannibalizes &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  Of the 1,225 US adults Cowen surveyed, 12% said they planned to purchase an iPad mini in the next 18 months, and of those, 52% said they&apos;d never owned a tablet before. More interesting still, of the survey respondents who said they planned to purchase an iPad mini, just 16.6% said they intended it as a replacement for another device, and of those, 29% said the gadget to be replaced was an iPad (13% said that device to be replaced was a Kindle Fire, and 42% a Windows PC).   Not sure if &quot;replace&quot; is the word you&apos;d use for buying an iPad mini v a Windows PC, unless it&apos;s actually replace as in &quot;chose not to buy&quot;. (Thanks @clarkeviper for the link.) Some thoughts and musings about making things for the web &gt;&gt; The Oatmeal &quot;Inspiration is more like food poisoning. It sprays out uncontrollably when you need it the least.&quot; US consumers hesitant to make switch to Windows 8 &gt;&gt; USA Today A (very large: 130,000 respondents) online survey by Avast shows a lot of reluctance to switch to Windows 8, and that about a third plan to buy an iPad or Apple Mac next rather than a new (Windows) PC. There is a text story, but the video is fascinating - for reporter Byron Acohido&apos;s home decor as much as anything. (Thanks @jseths on Twitter for the link.)

    "text": "Anna Schiffer is a senior teacher at OISE English language school in Bristol. She has taken her marker&apos;s pen to the letter Napoleon wrote to his teacher in 1816, when he was learning English while exiled on the island of St Helena. She also offers advice on how a student displaying similar language weaknesses could be supported. First, a transcript of the letter which Napoleon wrote at Longwood House, his residence on the island.  Napoleon appears to be informing his teacher that a letter from his wife will arrive with the next ship from France. According to Peter Hicks a historian based at the Fondation Napolon in Paris, who has studied Napoleon&apos;s attempts to learn English, he always wrote &quot;j&quot;  as in the French &quot;je&quot; - instead of I.   Count Lascases it is two o&apos;clock after midnight, j have enow sleep j go then finish the night into to cause with you he shall land above seven day a ship from Europa that we shall give account from anything who this shall have been even to day of first january thousand eight hundred sixteen. you shall have for this ocurens a letter from lady Lascases that shall you learn what himself could carry well if she had coceive the your but j tire myself and you shall have of the ade at conceive any ... upon this j intercede god etc etc Longwood this nine march thousand eight hundred and sixteen after the nativity of our saviour jesuf (sic) at four hours of the morning and half   There is no greeting, nor much natural language. For example instead of &quot;two o&apos;clock after midnight&quot; we could suggest &quot;2 am&quot; or &quot;two in the morning&quot;, Schiffer writes. The spelling is good, except for &quot;enow&quot;, but the use of tenses is restricted to the present simple and shall. There is no present perfect, as in &quot;I have had enough sleep&quot;. Typical of someone whose first language is French there is the non-use of &quot;will&quot; for a spontaneous decision, as in &quot;I will spend the night chatting&quot;. Punctuation errors include inconsistent capitalisation, and wrong formatting of the date. The use of the reflexive &quot;I tire myself&quot; is inappropriate, and there is completely incorrect use of the normal subject-verb word-order and a duplication of noun with pronoun: &quot;He shall land above seven day a ship&quot;. The sentences are not cohesive, as there is only one instance each of the simplest conjunctions &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot;. The word &quot;occurens&quot; does not exist, but is repeated. There is the classic use by a beginner of words which have been lifted from translation with no real understanding of their meaning, for example &quot;have the ado&quot;. There is no concept of basic collocation, for example &quot;spend the night&quot;. In all, this extract is incomprehensible, due to the lack of mastery of even the most basic grammatical structures. Sadly, even having made a great effort, the reader finishes with no real idea of the writer&apos;s message. How can we help Napoleon? I would suggest prizing him away from the grammar translation approach, which dominated language learning up until the 20th century and relied on translating long texts and memorising grammar rules. This is not his fault, as he is living in that era of language teaching, and he has limited opportunity to produce the language or be checked. I would first use a guided conversation approach about the event he is describing. This would include using scaffolding of basic word-order and sentence-structure. I would also introduce basic listening and dictation tasks from the outset to reinforce the word-order and sentence structure modelling. I would work with him on this writing; talking with him to discover what he really wanted to say. This would be done by identifying with him where he could break concepts down into clear, simple sentences using his new sentence construction skills. We could quite quickly master the simple &quot;Dear&quot; opening and a friendly closing expression, as well as how to write dates and times. Having done this, he could send his letter off in the knowledge that it was an effective and accurate communication.",

    "text": "Where&apos;s the creativity? Much anger this month over Michael Gove&apos;s reforms to the national curriculum, which artsy types say will kill British creativity. Take V&amp;A chief Martin Roth, who warns that Britain&apos;s creative economy will be destroyed within a generation &quot;if subjects such as art, design, music, drama and dance are pushed out of the curriculum&quot;. But can a formal curriculum ever breed creativity? For the teachers at the three Lumiar schools in Brazil, no it can&apos;t  or at least not in its conventional sense. Lumiar&apos;s progressive teachers don&apos;t teach from a syllabus. In fact, they&apos;re not even called teachers. They&apos;re called mentors, and what they teach their charges (aged 0-14) is mainly agreed through discussion with the children themselves. They have no lessons in the traditional sense, nor homework. Instead, the children work on &quot;projects&quot;, either suggested by theirmentors, or invented by the pupils. &quot;Achild can be dedicated for some time (weeks or even months) to something quite specific,&quot; writes Eduardo Chaves, an education professor involved in Lumiar&apos;s development, &quot;such as, for instance, finding out whether there is homosexuality among birds.&quot; The mentors (with help from &quot;masters&quot;, part-timers who impart specific skills) assess the students&apos; progress, and coaxthem towards certain goals  butthe emphasis is on what the studentswant tostudy. Lumiar was founded in 2003 by Ricardo Semler  a radical businessman who had previously turned his huge family firm over to its workers, allowing them to set their own wages and working hours. Semler believed that children learn best when they have a say in what they&apos;re learning  and it was on this principle that Lumiar&apos;s project-based system was founded. As a byproduct of these projects, it is hoped that students pick up key life skills through osmosis  writing, say, or teamwork. Collaboration is also something fostered by the school&apos;s democratic structure. Every week, the community gathers for The Circle, a meeting in which both adults and children vote on key school matters. &quot;We are trying to prove that by giving kids freedom,&quot; Semler has said, &quot;they will in the end be better educated.&quot;",

    "text": "Republicans in the North Carolina state legislature successfully overrode a veto to its bill allowing the fracking of natural gas, after a Democrat opponent absent-mindedly pushed the wrong button. State representative Becky Carney said that while sitting at her desk during Monday night&apos;s vote she plumped erroneously for the green &quot;yes&quot; button, only realising afterwards that she had meant to select the red &quot;no&quot;. The resulting 72-47 vote gave Republicans the majority they needed to overrule Governor Beverly Perdue&apos;s veto of a measure that could advance the use of fracking in the state. Carney&apos;s slip followed a marathon debate in the state legislature over the controversial mining technique opposed by many environmentalists. It came to a vote just after 11pm. Carney realised her mistake soon after making it, but Republicans in the House refused to allow her to retract her &quot;yes&quot; vote. The chamber&apos;s rules prevent members from changing a vote if it affects the outcome. Speaking to the Charlotte Observer on Tuesday, Carney put her hands up to the error. &quot;It was a huge mistake. I take full responsibility,&quot; she told the newspaper.",

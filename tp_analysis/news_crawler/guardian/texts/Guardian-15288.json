    "text": "Today the University of London will be deciding whether or not to abolish its students&apos; union, the University of London Union, which represents more than 120,000 members across the city. ULU has existed for many decades and is currently the only London-wide union for students. Over the last few years, ULU has played a key role in the student movement, acting as a focal point for anti-cuts and workers&apos; rights campaigns. These moves come as the culmination of a review on which no student was invited to sit. If approved, this would strip ULU of its building and resources and force its representative functions into an undefined and unresourced new structure. In a climate of privatisation and cuts, it would set a dangerous precedent for university managers to attack and undermine democratic union structures. As politicians from across London, we understand the value of having a strong student movement in London. Students, like many London residents, face issues of poverty, appalling housing conditions and attacks on public services. We cannot afford to lose the core of what could be a major force for good in the capital.Ken Livingston Former leader, Greater London Council, Valerie Shawcross London assembly member, Lambeth and Southwark, Diane Abbott MP Shadow minister for public health, John McDonnell MP Lab, Hayes and Harlington; former deputy leader, Greater London Council, Andrew Dismore London assembly member, Barnet and Camden, John Biggs London assembly member, City and East London, Fiona Twycross London assembly member, Darren Johnson London assembly member, TomCopley London assembly member, Jenny Jones London assembly member",

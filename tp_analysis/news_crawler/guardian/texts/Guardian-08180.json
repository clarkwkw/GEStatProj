    "text": "The sari, aka &quot;the six-yard wonder&quot;, should be a sustainable garment without peer. Whether the wearer expands or shrinks, it&apos;s easily adapted; you control how the folds of fabric are arranged. In theory it can be worn forever, moving through life with you  the antithesis of fast fashion. The best traditional Banarasi silk saris were hand loomed by highly skilled artisans in the Indian holy city of Varanasi. Then  affecting almost every other part of the textile supply chain  along came China. By 2010 India was importing 6.4bn rupees worth of Chinese silk fabrics, all but destroying the homegrown industry. Not that we should get all rose-tinted about homegrown production. In 2003 Human Rights Watch found 72 silk units in one area of Varanasi and just one poor-quality school  the children were mainly working in sari units. Although the ILO (International Labour Organisation) acknowledges that there has been progress, as the 2016 deadline for the worldwide eradication of child labour looms the pace of progress is slowing. When you buy a sari, ask questions about the importer supply chain. The onus is on them to provide certification from the production facilities, including the beading workshops. What is the minimum ageof workers? (It should be 18.) What is the minimum wage (preferably a&quot;living wage&quot;)? Are there stipulated working hours and paid overtime? These are fundamentals. Also, prioritise heritage skill programmes that reward craftsmen. I have failed to find fairtrade UK retailers, but there are schemes supporting artisans who produce authentic saris. Look for co-operatives such as Artisan Hut in Bangladesh; craftrevival.org, acampaigning organisation in India, is a useful source, and rkderawala.com, with its vegetable-dyed saris from Bagru, keeps skilled producers in the game. Above all, go for hand loomed, says founder of UK clothing brand People Tree Safia Minney, who has worked with Artisan Hut and used about 4,000 skilled producers in People Tree&apos;s lines. The mechanisation of textile production has been a disaster for rural producers, so look for saris made using traditional methods that don&apos;t need electricity. Hand weaving uses nine times more labour than material produced on a power loom. There&apos;s no need to dress up the positive impact of keeping artisanal weavers employed. Green crush Our current definition of farming is too narrow. Forget turnips and grow furniture: that&apos;s the message from Berlin industrial design company Studio Aisslinger. Inspired by the popularity of home-grown food, designer Werner Aisslinger (who has previously produced a hi-tech hemp chair) has focused on willow  which grows quickly in the UK climate. Planted in a field or greenhouse, the willow grows inside a light-weight steel corset. When it is mature the corset is removed toreveal a naturally grown chair.

    "text": "Every day I put out two small trays filled with mixed grain under the fruit trees, mainly to feed the three or four pairs of ground-feeding yellowhammers. Then, early one morning, three weeks ago, I noticed that one of the trays was completely empty and I suspected we had been visited by a pine marten. That evening, after darkness fell, I went through to the utility room and shone a torch through the window. I first focused the beam on the apples I have been sticking on the fruit trees but there was nothing there so I lowered the beam to the two trays. There, only four paces from me, was a badger tucking into the mixed grain. My feelings, with such a close view, are hard to describe as badgers have always filled me with a sense of awe. Perhaps this is partly because I just do not understand their life underground and the fact they emerge in the dark. The most distinguishing feature was the black-and-white striped head with its white-tipped ears. However, I was also impressed with the sheer size of it and the coat that looked as though it had a silvery sheen. Unfortunately, the badger did not like the light and moved off. However, it soon returned and ignored the beam as this time I used a red filter. Now one tray is filled with peanuts, which the badgers prefer, and I look at my watch every evening waiting for &quot;badger watch&quot; time. For the past few nights I have been getting to my vantage point earlier which enables me to see the badger without a torch. One aspect that intrigues me is how to describe its gait, as it is half walking and half trotting. It seemed incongruous that after watching the badger I return to another room to be greeted by five dachshunds. Their name, translated from the German, means &quot;badger hound&quot; as the standard breed was formerly used for badger baiting.",

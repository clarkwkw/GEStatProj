    "text": "We are conscious of the fact that by running the awards we will inevitably create activity that wouldn&apos;t otherwise have occurred. Energy will be used, materials will be consumed, some waste will be created. We understand that we have a responsibility to ensure that the positive benefits of the awards are not overshadowed by their footprint.  We run all aspects of the awards process to comply with the BS8901 British Standard for Sustainable Event Management. Later this year a new version of this standard will be issued as ISO20121, and we&apos;re using draft versions of this new standard to ensure we comply to the latest international best practice.  We are also committed to ensuring the judging process is open, transparent and fair. We invite judges from all disciplines and backgrounds to sit on our panel, and they demand the highest possible standards of ethics and fair play. While we regret that we cannot enter into correspondence with individual entrants we can assure all participants that every entry is given due scrutiny by our expert panel.",

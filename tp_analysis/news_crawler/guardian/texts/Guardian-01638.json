    "text": "In what could be interpreted as a sign that Americans are gaining confidence in the economy and feeling more charitable, giving to educational institutions rose significantly last year, according to a new survey. Colleges and universities raised $30.3bn in charitable contributions in 2011, the second highest amount ever. More than half 58%  of schools polled enjoyed a bump in contributions. That number was just 33% in 2009.  The biggest year on record for educational institutions was 2008, when colleges and universities received a combined $31.6bn. Still, much of that donor money remains clustered at the top. Although the top 20 institutions represent just 2% of the survey&apos;s 1,000 respondents, they received more than 27% of all 2011 gifts to higher educational institutions.  Giving to these 20 institutions was $1.12bn higher than last year, accounting for nearly half to the increase to all institutions polled by the Council for Aid to Education. Stanford, Harvard and a slice of elite universities reaped the biggest individual gains. Public medical schools and liberal arts colleges also attracted higher contributions than others. CAE&apos;s annual survey of 1,009 schools comes on the heels of the latest Philanthropy 50, which ranks the top 50 donors in the US. The most recent survey showed that the most popular beneficiaries were universities and colleges, which attracted $1.5bn from 19 donors last year.",

    "text": "A selection of links, hand-picked by the Guardian games writers. Call of Duty Ghosts release date, gameplay details and next gen engine leaked - Xbox 360 - The Official Magazine Tesco is apparently at it again, accidentally &apos;revealing&apos; the next Call of Duty&apos;s release date (4 November) and next-generation engine:  A now-edited listing (thanks to AllGamesBeta for saving us a copy) puts it as follows. &quot;The franchise that has defined a generation of gaming is set to raise the bar once again with the all-new Call of Duty: Ghosts. Published by Activision and developed by Infinity Ward, the studio that created the original Call of Duty and the seminal Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series, Call of Duty: Ghosts ushers in the next generation of the franchise, delivering a riveting all-new gameplay experience built on an entirely new story, setting and cast, all powered by a new next-generation Call of Duty engine.&quot;  Xbox 360: hype and broken promises | Wired UK  Many of the things Microsoft talked about at the beginning of the generation turned out to be so much vapourware. And often instead of pursuing them, Microsoft allowed the competition to. It&apos;s pretty clear Microsoft was shining us on about well, a lot.  This is a rather uncompromising look at some of the promises Microsoft made about its current system at the outset. Sure there was a lot of hype and bluster involved, but the machine got an awful lot right, and did foresee the rise of social gaming and asynchronous competition with Achievements and Gamerscores... What Games Are: The Scientism Delusion | TechCrunch A really interesting look at how the mainstream games industry is looking for success in the wrong way, relying on faux-science rather than gut instinct:  Rather than applying mystical formulas to self-selected confirmation biases, and assuming that secret sauces are only the right pinch of salt away, the more successful approach to games usually revolves around what Seth Godin calls tribal marketing. Rather than say &quot;We have an idea that fits a genre, let&apos;s make that idea, then when we make that idea let&apos;s market that idea, and if we just do that well enough then we will succeed,&quot; the really successful game maker usually starts with &quot;I have an obsession. Do other people have the same obsession? Let&apos;s see if there&apos;s a game there.&quot;  Backgrounds | rotational Ex-Edge editor Alex Wiltshire blogs about this wonderful collection of backgrounds from classic 2D fighting games.  Anyway, for me, these backgrounds&apos; beauty lies in their navigation of technical constraints. They push through the problems of low resolution with sharply outlined elements or subtle gradations. They&apos;re incredibly careful with the number of animations they show and how many frames of animation from which they&apos;re made. Some look like living scenes, even if the effect&apos;s set by a surprisingly small number of moving components.  Untappd: Gamification of Beer | Baltimore Post-Examiner Bore of buying the same old beers? Fear not, the process of ale selection has now been gamified!  Quickly I found that Untappd was engaging. I started checking in every beer I had, and it seemed like every third one awarded a badge. I was pulling up the app when shopping for beer to see if certain beers were on the list to qualify for a particular badge. Honestly I really don&apos;t care about the badges, but it was fun. It was a great way to discover new beer. Or, at least new to me beers.  Humanity&apos;s last hope is your finger nail clippings in this Ahoge entry | IndieGames.com  The 9th Ahoge (&quot;stupid game&quot;) jam has ended, and the moon-themed creations have poured in, such as the above-pictured VS (full moon vs humanity) by gobori. In this game, players must carefully ricochet their clipped nails to stop the moon from crashing into Earth. Bizarre. Other notable Ahoge theme derivations include super sensitive moon landing from Nekogames, Michael Jackson-style moon walking auto platformer from AZur Studio, and the very risque moon (butt) smacking click-fest from liryu. For a few laughs, feel free to browse all Ahoge entries. Consider it a warm up for the insane amount of games to play from this weekend&apos;s Ludum Dare.

Since we launched the site on 22 May last year:  a student protest march fizzled out at a rainy rally where the NUS president was pelted with eggs student activism staged a dramatic recovery thanks to a plucky occupation by Sussex students protesting against privatisation girls became a third more likely than boys to go to university a student union employee posted film of a couple having sex at a ball all over the internet and students filmed each other pouring milk on their heads We&apos;ve been busy too, and throughout the day tomorrow we&apos;ll be highlighting some of our best bits in a live blog on the Guardian Students site. If you&apos;ve written for us, keep your eyes peeled: you may feature in our Best of the Blogs. Rebecca Ratcliffe has interviewed the new leader of the NUS Toni Pearce  and discovered that she&apos;s the first president never to have got a university degree. More revelations tomorrow... But birthdays, let&apos;s face it, are all about presents. And we&apos;ve got heaps to hand out to anyone who has signed up for membership since the very beginning. So take a moment&apos;s break from your revision to fill in this little form right now, and you&apos;ll be eligible for our prize draws on the hour on Wednesday from 10am-5pm. Easy as that, no multiple choice, no essay questions  just sit back and wait to see if you win one of dozens of really rather marvellous things: Clothing vouchers from Topshop, Topman and Figleaves, Amazon vouchers from Coventry University London Campus, books galore courtesy of our colleagues on Guardian Books, a free haircut from Jones and Payne, goodies from Noisey, the music channel of Vice, subsriptions to the NME, Cath Kidson vouchers, trips to Alton Towers for you and all your mates and, wait for it, an iPad Mini.

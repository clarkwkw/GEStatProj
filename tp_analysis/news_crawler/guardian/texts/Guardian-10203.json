    "text": "Here at the Hadron Collider Physics symposium in Kyoto, three experimental talks on searches for physics beyond the Standard Model have just finished, all with the same result: nothing so far. Those talks were focussed mostly on direct searches, that is for the production of real new particles, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. One of the most constraining measurements, however, comes from the LHCb experiment and is the first evidence of the decay of a known particle - the Bs meson, which is made of a bottom quark and a strange anti-quark - to a pair of muons. Like the Bs, muons are well known - they are just heavier versions of the electron. Conservation laws in the standard model mean this decay cannot happen directly. It has to go via a quantum loop. In the standard model, the quark and antiquark must swap a W boson, transforming them into a top-antitop quark pair, which then annihilates to a photon, Z boson or a Higgs boson, which then decays to the muons. If that sounds unlikely, it is. About three out of every billion Bs mesons do this.  LHCb has evidence (at the 3.5 sigma level) that this is indeed happening, and the rate is consistent with the Standard Model. This is a great success for a sophisticated calculation. But it&apos;s also a bit disappointing. The reason is that in that rare process, lots of possible new particles could have fitted into that decay chain in the place of the W or the Z, for example. If they were there, the rate would change. If the rate agrees with the Standard Model (as it seems to) they aren&apos;t there.  Lots of variants of supersymmetry would add new particles there. One of the big motivations for supersymmetry is that the new particles it introduces appear in loops like that and help stabilise the Higgs boson mass. So naively at least it should show up in other loops, like the ones in the Bs decay. The fact that it doesn&apos;t seem to is a blow. Joe Lykken in his keynote introduction talk said that supersymmetry was a good idea 20 years ago, is a good idea now, and will still be a good idea in 20 years time.  But is it, I wonder, any more than that? Matt Strassler (who is sitting in front of me) wrote a blogpost with some more of the numbers in. The LHCb paper is here, and there is a seminar at CERN this morning, which will be webcast (10am UK/11am European time).",

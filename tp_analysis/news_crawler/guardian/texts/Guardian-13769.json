    "text": "In February 2013, Opera Software announced that it had passed the 300m monthly users milestone across its web browsers for phones, tablets, TVs and computers. At the same time, it sprang a surprise by revealing that it was switching from its own Presto rendering engine to the WebKit engine that&apos;s familiar from other mobile browsers. The company said at the time that the switch would eliminate duplication of efforts: its engineers could focus less on trying to match WebKit features in Presto, and more on other improvements to Opera&apos;s browsers. I sat down with Opera&apos;s web evangelist Bruce Lawson at Mobile World Congress to talk more about this, but also about the wider mobile trends that have been driving Opera&apos;s growth, and the debate around web standards and native apps. &quot;When I joined four and a half years ago, we hadn&apos;t got to 100m users. Now there are 300m,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s big growth, particularly in uncertain economic times. The financials have been good, and the industry has been changing all the time.&quot; There have been surprises along the way. For example, the Opera Mini browser, which Lawson says was originally seen as a product for the developing world, turned out to be a big hit with Western smartphone owners as well. &quot;The one thing a farmer in rural Bangladesh has with a businessman in Barcelona is shit and expensive connectivity!&quot; he said. &quot;Both ends of the spectrum have the same needs, in that sense.&quot; Mobile has been part of Opera&apos;s bigger vision around the importance of web standards and interoperability, which Lawson noted is much more a fact of life now, rather than being seen as an &quot;esoteric&quot; campaign. &quot;These days, my missus uses Internet Explorer at work, Safari on her iPhone and Opera on the home computer. It&apos;s inconceivably stupid if, for example, your bank&apos;s website will only work on one or two of those browsers,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s not an esoteric thing about web everywhere. It&apos;s just a rubbish consumer experience. People expect that their websites will work across modern browsers, and it really is a crusty old website that doesn&apos;t do that.&quot; The standards war is won, then? Perhaps not. In a blog post on his personal website at the time of the WebKit announcement, Lawson explained how the debate has shifted: &quot;The web needs to win. Browsers are highly interoperable, because all vendors know that if they&apos;re not, they risk being overtaken by proprietary platforms. It used to be Flash and Silverlight that threatened the web. Today&apos;s threats are proprietary app platforms and locked-in &apos;eco-systems&apos;. Tomorrow, new threats will rise.&quot; At MWC, Lawson told me how he sees the rise of &quot;devices that you can&apos;t install other things on&quot; as problematic or at least devices where the manufacturer (e.g. Apple) sets the rules on what can and can&apos;t be installed. Opera, of course, does have its Opera Mini browser available on iOS, albeit conforming to Apple&apos;s rules on browser apps that compete with its own Safari. And now WebKit, which powers that very browser. Lawson is enthusiastic about the implications of the switch for Opera and its 300m users. &quot;WebKit is the kind of thing we dreamed of building,&quot; he said. &quot;It adheres very well to modern standards: it&apos;s generally an excellently standards-compliant browser. And there are diverse organisations involved, with the small players playing an increasingly important role.&quot; Competing rendering engines, and the impact felt when a company like Opera switches from one to another, are important issues for web developers. Less so for internet users (whether mobile or not) who are choosing between browsers on other criteria. &quot;When you buy a car, you don&apos;t tend to ask who made the gearbox. If you&apos;re a long-distance sales rep, you might choose the car based on how comfortable it is to sit in four hours a day,&quot; said Lawson. &quot;If you&apos;re a petrolhead, you&apos;re interested in its nought-to-60 time. If you live in a city, you might be much more concerned with fuel consumption. Each of these people have different criteria, and they&apos;re largely not about who manufactured the engine.&quot; In other words, switching to WebKit will enable Opera to focus on making more innovative features to follow its speed dials and data compression technology, among others. &quot;If you&apos;re an engineer spending all of your time coding in order to duplicate something another guy already implemented in another rendering engine, the novelty palls,&quot; said Lawson. &quot;If you&apos;re an engineer and someone asks &apos;Would you like to do some cool shit, and here&apos;s lots of resources to do it&apos;, you&apos;re going to be a lot happier. Adopting WebKit has freed up loads of the cleverest people in the company to think about those things.&quot; Lawson said that Opera won&apos;t keep all this innovation to itself. The company contributed a small &quot;symbolic&quot; patch to WebKit on the day of its announcement, and will be adding others in the months to come. Do regular mobile users care about the web standards debate? Which sounds like a rude question, but isn&apos;t meant as such: it certainly affects them and their usage of devices, but do they understand why Lawson and his peers see it as so important? &quot;If you talk about people who care about, say, Ubuntu being open and about open source, they&apos;re not consumers. Those are mega nerds and I&apos;m proud to be one!&quot; he said. &quot;If you mean my mum or missus, no, they don&apos;t know the terms interoperability and open standards. What they do know is the fact that when they go to a website on Opera, IE and Safari, it works. That&apos;s what standards give consumers, and that&apos;s what they notice.&quot; Lawson pointed to the explosion in connected devices within the home as being an important factor here  as I wrote this interview, NPD Group has just released results of a survey suggesting the average internet-connected US household now has 5.7 connected, app-capable devices. &quot;There&apos;s a PS3, Wii, laptops, smartphones, a smart TV, internet radio and then all the stuff I&apos;ve got for work,&quot; said Lawson. &quot;And of course, they all need to talk to each other.&quot; It feels like an exciting time for Opera, with mobile growth, the WebKit switch, a new Android browser beta, and its recent acquisition of a former competitor Skyfire, which had pivoted towards mobile video optimisation. iOS and Android may be the kingpins of the smartphone world in early 2013, but the efforts of Opera (and Mozilla, of course, with its Firefox OS) shouldn&apos;t be over-simplified as an attempt to beat those big guns. It&apos;s as much about keeping up the pressure on them to ensure the web platform remains open and becomes ubiquitous. Or as he puts it at MWC: &quot;The standards discussion is still vital. We need interoperability to move the web forward and keep it as open as we need.&quot;",

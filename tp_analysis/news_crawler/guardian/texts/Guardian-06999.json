    "text": "I entered teaching directly with a first-class degree in maths and no training (Gove tells academies they can hire unqualified teaching staff, 28 July). No one had time to support me much so, for the first two or three years, I made a hash of it, except with students who were like me: white, middle-class, well-behaved, and already good at maths. Fortunately I was near a maths education university department with professional development opportunities, otherwise I would have sunk or continued to favour only the few. You can see from my current job that eventually I did alright. I did that through seeking training and continuing to study how to teach maths. I now train teachers as part of my work, but contrary to what some commentators say we do not teach theory or dated ideology; we work on maths and how children learn it and we introduce research and professional literature. I have just reviewed students&apos; evaluations at the end of their course: they say our teaching makes them think; they adapt ideas for their students; they report the importance of being among people who learn, plan, teach, discuss together. They are mostly better teachers already than I was after three years of teaching. Cutting corners sometimes works, but doing a job from the foundations upwards usually has better results.Anne WatsonProfessor of mathematics education, University of Oxford  I am appalled that this government is to allow unqualified people to teach in academies. It is obvious that those behind this decision were not educated in the 50s and 60s in a grammar school setting, as I was. The teachers were all graduates, who no doubt knew their subjects. But rather than teach (they were not teachers) they imparted facts on a blackboard and expected us to understand the learning objectives without any help, as they were unable to offer it. It is very difficult to understand a mathematical theorem if it is just given to you without an explanation. This &quot;teaching&quot; was across all subjects and it was not until 1962 that teachers began to be appointed with a degree in their subject and a PGCE qualification. It is only due to these teachers that I gained the qualifications necessary for me to become a teacher. It would definitely be a retrograde step to appoint people to a teaching post just because they know their subject but then so is everything that this government says that it is trying to achieve in education.Elizabeth JonesBushey, Hertfordshire  Unusually, I agree with the government. Children today need markedly higher technical skills, not least in maths, to contribute effectively to an increasingly technical workforce. Too few teachers have the necessary knowledge to teach those subjects well. Being trained how to teach does not improve your ability to communicate your subject, if you don&apos;t really know your subject. (anyone who doubts this statement should read Paul Lockhart&apos;s A mathematician&apos;s lament). Bringing top-grade, skills-specific graduates into schools will boost the quality of education for students and provide an essential boost to the UK economy when they enter the workforce. The same problems facing US technical education are happening to us now. We can&apos;t let that happen.Peter HendersonEastleigh, Hampshire  I am all but innumerate. I can tell that I now pay five shillings for an orange that should cost an old sixpence  that is the extent of my mathematical ability and it is all I need. Maths was a compulsory subject in school certificate. In my young days I sat the exam six times and failed  distinctions in English, English literature, history and art counted for nothing. After the seventh sitting, the examiners relented, granting me a &quot;subsidiary pass in arithmetic&quot; so that I might sit university entrance exams. Without that subsidiary pass I would have been an abject academic failure. To all who suffer dyscalculia, a cerebral condition recognised only in 1974 and not yet by education authorities, compulsory maths is the most cruel of impositions.Brian SewellLondon  Michael Gove appears to think people can do well in jobs for which they are not trained. Perhaps he should look at his and his colleagues&apos; performance as they try to do their jobs without any proper training or experience of the real world.Ron Brewer,Old Buckenham, Norfolk  How is Michael Gove able to continue with his stream of announcements designed to turn the clock back on education policy, such as the decision to allow academies to hire unqualified teachers? The answer is simple. At the start of the coalition the Lib Dems were effectively excluded from schools policy. Although there is a children&apos;s minister they do not have an education minister in the department. This was to enable Gove to pursue his ideological mission unhindered. But surely that should not prevent the Lib Dems refusing to sanction the most egregious decisions such as this one? Otherwise they will have no educational credibility left, and although the Conservatives did not win the election they will be able to carry on acting as though they did.Professor Ron GlatterHemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire  Christine Blower fears that allowing those without qualified teacher status into the classroom will cause &quot;irreparable damage to children&apos;s education&quot;. As an &quot;unqualified&quot; teacher of English and music, with 20 years&apos; experience  10 years&apos; working in adult education and in universities in the UK and abroad, and 10 years&apos; teaching in secondary schools (co-ed. boarding and single-sex day)  I refute her accusation. Blower declares that parents will be horrified if teachers do not have &quot;the appropriate qualification&quot;; surely what parents want is teachers who have the knowledge and skills to teach, encourage and inspire their children, regardless of whether they can add qualified teacher status to the other acronyms which may succeed their name? Certainly, the students I teach, and their parents, do not seem unduly concerned by my &apos;unqualified&apos; status. Of more importance and relevance is, as Francis Gilbert declares (This proposal is an outrage, 28 July), is my ability to understand how children learn, to assist their learning, to assess effectively, and to deal with the academic rigours of my subjects. They also wish to be certain that I have significant specialist knowledge. Possessing qualified teacher status does not guarantee any of these qualities or attributes. Of course, teachers&apos; professionalism must be respected and maintained, and ongoing training and professional development are essential. But, denying children access to the considerable expertise and experience possessed by the &quot;unqualified&quot; seems short-sighted and unimaginative.Dr CK SeymourLondon  So the secretary of state makes yet another breathtakingly govine decision. Pity his declarations are so lacking in intelligent design. Just how long will the country allow him to continue his dismantling of state education nurtured so carefully for over 100 years; and under a coalition too.David J HandleySkipton, North Yorkshire",

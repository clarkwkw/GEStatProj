    "text": "Famed for his enthusiasm and an unfortunate habit of getting carried away and promising slightly more than his development team could deliver, industry veteran Peter Molyneux has left Microsoft to set up an experimental games company, whose first title was Curiosity: What&apos;s Inside The Cube? In it, players collectively chipped away at a vast onscreen cube with a promise that there was a prize in the middle that only one of them could win, which would prove &quot;life-changing&quot;. After tapping away 25bn little pieces of cube, players finally discovered what the mysterious object of their curiosity had been: the chance to be digital god of all other players in Molyneux&apos;s upcoming game, Godus. The winner will also receive a share of profits, which, depending on its success, may or may not actually turn out to be life-changing.",

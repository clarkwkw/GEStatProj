    "text": "Higher education&apos;s biggest challenge is to respond successfully to the changes and shocks that are still evolving in the system. Universities UK conducted a project with vice-chancellors on our Longer Term Strategy Network and we are putting together a report and resources to help universities plan more effectively for the future. Many wider themes emerged during the course of the project. One clear revelation was that many of the challenges likely to shape the future are already with us, such as new entrants and models of delivery, globalisation and &apos;the market&apos;. Indeed, a quick look at the past 30 years&apos; newspaper archives shows some rather familiar stories. However, it is clear that the big challenge now is to responding successfully to the changes HE sector is experiencing. Many institutions already use scenario exercises for organisational planning and strategy development, often with a three or five year horizon. The challenge was to go further into the future, to 2040. Given the shifting landscape universities are experiencing currently, it was important to give participants the opportunity to lift their sights above the immediate pressures they face. Focusing on the longer term encouraged them to think in new ways about the key trends that would have the most impact on their work. Similarly the project also helped to identify those areas of genuine uncertainty. One important point stressed was that longer term work should not be seen as an attempt to forecast the future. It is much more useful to see it as a process that encourages reflection. Projecting long term quantitative trends would be different altogether. For many participants the opportunity to have this conversation helped them to develop a shared understanding of the challenges that their institutions face. Institutions need to integrate these exercises into their wider work. Sessions can be used to help start the process of strategy development, evaluate an existing strategy midterm. Many of the sessions identified specific areas for additional attention, ranging from concrete steps toward generating endowment income through to the integration of a marketing strategy. But what about going beyond contingency planning? And what do universities want for the future? There is no single answer to this, but institutions inevitably want to remain resilient and maintain their reputations for excellence. During the project universities reiterated their commitment to placing themselves at the heart of social and economic advance by being responsive to the needs of society, regardless of their profile or positioning. The sector also recognised the need to maintain an unswerving commitment to quality. Hopefully the UUK project will play its part in helping to maintain UK higher education&apos;s deserved position as one of this country&apos;s leading international success stories.

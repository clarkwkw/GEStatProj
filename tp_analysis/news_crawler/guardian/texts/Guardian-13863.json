    "text": "Rare gems of originality are often crowded out in the busy app market but occasionally one really does shine. Towelfight 2: The Monocle of Destiny (65-60p, Butterscotch Shenanigans, iOS/Android) has some impressively fresh gameplay. You play the part of an old Indian man, Hardik, who is whisked through a magical portal to a strange land while out walking his dog. There, the kindly Jobi bestows upon him a projectile-firing monocle with which to defeat the evil Forn, who controls the land. Instead of bullets, the eyepiece fires animals  40 types, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Controlled with two D-pads either side of the screen  one for movement and one for shooting the visuals are a pleasing top-down 2D style, reminiscent of the classic Zelda games, but given an idiosyncratic twist. It makes for a novel fusion of styles lifting Towelfight 2 above the standard fare. Using the pads is sometimes a bit fiddly, but they work well enough not to detract from the enjoyment. With many different animals to be collected, as well as the many power-ups for them, there&apos;s plenty to do  and with a level of humour not seen in a standard shooter. Rather than &quot;headshot&quot; or some such popping on when an enemy is fragged, entirely random words or phrases flash on the screen. Perhaps reading &quot;spleen&quot; when a bad-guy is dispatched shouldn&apos;t be funny, but the incongruous nature of the congratulations can&apos;t help but raise a smile. If only all developers made their offerings feel so excitingly novel.",

    "text": "Through all the educational changes of the last 30 years, Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Schools have managed to retain respect. Gordon Hamflett, who has died aged 84, was the very model of a respected HMI: fair, objective, courteous and thorough. He spoke truth to power, whether at local authority level or in his reports to central government. Born in Newcastle, he was educated at Wolverhampton grammar school before winning a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1945. In 1948 he began his teaching career as a mathematics teacher at Manchester grammar school. Gordon remained there until 1962 when Eric James, the high master, recommended him for appointment as an HMI. He was one of a number of young appointments who were involved in modernising the inspectorate as it came to terms with increasing central involvement in educational decision-making. He was based initially in the West Midlands, later in Essex, and was seconded for three years as a joint secretary of the Schools Council. In 1976 he was promoted to divisional inspector as a safe pair of hands for a tough job that entailed the skilful management of a large field-force of inspectors working in the north of England from Sheffield to the Borders. In the words of a former senior chief inspector, he was &quot;first and foremost a reliably pastoral DI, always well informed, clear in his views, a good organiser  and a hard and conscientious worker&quot;. Gordon&apos;s colleagues bear witness to his well-regulated but humane style of management. He had an eye for detail that caused much amusement and the occasional headache to writers of successive draft reports. He was immensely kind and caring to colleagues and their families  always ready to support and to forgive lapses. All would echo the words of a colleague: &quot;I have a lot of time for Gordon; you&apos;ve got to have a lot of time for Gordon.&quot; A lifelong Methodist, on his retirement to Ilkley, West Yorkshire, in 1987 he took an active part in town and church activities  serving on a large number of committees, acting as an influential governor at Ashville college, Harrogate, and providing inspirational Christian leadership at Christchurch, Ilkley. He is survived by his second wife, Margaret, his sons David and Keith, from his marriage to Elizabeth, who died in 1995, and grandchildren Robert, Richard, Jennifer and Timothy.",

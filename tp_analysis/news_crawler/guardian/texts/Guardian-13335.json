    "text": "So here were are. Six weeks of evidence sessions, dozens of witnesses and many hundreds of tweets later, the public evidence gathering for the all-party cycling group&apos;s Get Britain Cycling inquiry is over. And what have we learned? The short answer, I fear, is not much fundamentally beyond what we knew on 23 January, the day it all started. The brief, somewhat depressing version seems to be this: most people agree more cycling would be good for the country. Cycling organisations know very well how this could be achieved. The government knows it too, but lacks the political will and/or political vision to achieve anything meaningful. As I also pointed out at the start of this process, this doesn&apos;t make the inquiry less valuable, or diminish the very real achievements of the all-party group and the Times, which inspired the hearings through its campaigning and supported its cost. Sometimes the seemingly self-evident needs pointing out on a public stage, just to reinforce how dreadful a position we&apos;re in. And it&apos;s undeniable Britain remains years, probably decades, from being a true cycling country. When there were surprises at an inquiry where often it seemed the participants and panellists thought very similarly it came in glimpses from the non-cycling world. There were two such telling moments at yesterday&apos;s final evidence session. One came from Mark Milsom, assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire Police, speaking for the Association of Chief Police Officers. &quot;We are not enforcing 20mph speed limits at this moment in time,&quot; he told a somewhat aghast inquiry.  The other was from Norman Baker, the junior transport minister whose remit takes in cycling. During a slightly depressing chat I had with Baker in January he insisted his action for cycling was supported at the very top of government, a line he repeated yesterday. OK, came the follow-up question, how many direct chats have you had with David Cameron about cycling? The answer: none. So there you have it. A minister for cycling who can&apos;t see the UK ever getting near Dutch levels of cycling has never discussed cycling with his ultimate boss. That tells you a lot about where we are. Away from the gloom, there were plenty of very interesting subjects given a valuable airing, for example the apparent inability of the courts to properly punish drivers who injure or kill cyclists.  It&apos;s also good to have the fallacies about cycling&apos;s risks debunked, or at least put in the context of the risks from inactivity. As Dr Adrian Davies, a specialist in transport and health, pointed out:  For every 1 pound spent on cycling initiatives they can generally return up to 4 in saved costs to the NHS and value to the economy. The health benefits of cycling outweigh the risks by 20 to one.  This was a theme echoed, to her credit, by Anna Soubry, a junior health minister, who also appeared. Arguably more telling, however, was Soubry conceding she had stopped cycling as an adult and that she didn&apos;t let her two daughters onto the roads for safety reasons. Given that her children are teenagers this a bit depressing. Infinitely more cheering was Chris Boardman, the Olympic champion-turned bike company owner, giving the inquiry his trademark brand of eloquent good sense. Encouraging more demand for cycling is not enough, he warned:  We need to address the environment on the streets to see a real culture change; cycling should be an easy choice for people.  It&apos;s worth pointing out that Boardman call the inquiry a &quot;watershed moment&quot;, so maybe I&apos;m being too downbeat.  But maybe not. One of the very first pieces of evidence came from Phillip Darnton, formerly head of the now-abolioshed Cycling England quango, a man who has seen more false dawns for British cycling than I&apos;ve had hot dinners. He summed things up very well, I thought:  We will not create a cycling culture until we have leadership that makes it clear this is a commitment for the long term. This is not a party-political thing... We need to take that stance and no political party ever questions it again. We could start tomorrow if we wanted.  And that&apos;s the crux. We could start tomorrow. But it seems like we won&apos;t.",

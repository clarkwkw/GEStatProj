    "headline": "Turning profits and tackling poverty not contradictory, insists IFC chief", 
    "text": "The International Finance Corporation, the branch of the World Bank that deals with private companies, last month announced a potential multimillion-euro investment in Lidl, the discount supermarket chain, to help it expand in Bulgaria, Croatia and Serbia. This deal would not only create jobs, it said, but also contribute to development by giving low-income consumers greater access to cheap, quality food. It&apos;s precisely the sort of proposal that raises eyebrows among critics, who accuse the IFC of backing projects that &quot;stretch the interpretation of development&quot;. Owned by the German multinational Schwarz Group, Lidl is one of Europe&apos;s largest and fastest-growing retail chains. It is &quot;Europe&apos;s Walmart&quot;, with no-frills displays, ultra-low prices and a controversial history when it comes to workers&apos; rights. Bloomberg&apos;s billionaires list ranks the man at the top, Dieter Schwarz, the 33rd richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of more than $20bn. If the IFC is the largest development finance institution focused exclusively on the private sector, it&apos;s also one of the more controversial players in the fight against global poverty. Last year, it invested more than $20bn around the world  but is arguably most famous for its involvement in projects campaigners say do more for corporate profits than the world&apos;s poor people. Recently, attention has turned to its role in controversial mining projects, airport expansions and luxury hotels. Jin-Yong Cai, the IFC chief executive, acknowledges there have been concerns about the institution&apos;s development impact. However, he insists, creating profitable companies and tackling poverty should not be seen as contradictory goals. &quot;Look, I&apos;m from China, I&apos;ve always believed if you really want to help people grow out of poverty, you have to give them jobs  sustainable jobs,&quot; Cai says. &quot;The truth is, the business world is risky, sometimes you may have companies disappear  that is always the risk, particularly in developing countries  so to have development impact does not mean you don&apos;t look at profitability. The sustainability of those engines for job creation requires profitability.&quot; Employment has shot up the development agenda as estimates suggest 600m new jobs will be needed in the next 15 years to keep up with population growth. Some experts are lobbying for a target on job creation to be included in any deal that follows the millennium development goals, which expire in 2015. Cai hopes IFC investments create more &quot;quality jobs&quot; where employees have the chance to accumulate the skills and knowledge they need to move forward. &quot;Frankly, I would love to see a lot of our clients become middle class. That&apos;s really our goal, it&apos;s not just constantly spending.&quot; Larger companies, he says, often create more, and more sustainable, jobs than smaller firms. &quot;We&apos;re very much focused on evidence,&quot; he insists. And what&apos;s important, he argues, is not only the direct jobs created by IFC investments but also the &quot;multiplier effects&quot; on supply chains and distribution networks, which employ others along the way. If these knock-on effects aren&apos;t always apparent, it is far more obvious when things appear to go horribly wrong. In South Africa, for example, campaigners alarmed by the violent protests and strikes at the Marikana platinum mine quickly unearthed the IFC&apos;s multimillion-dollar deals with Lonmin, the London-based company that runs the mine. Cai says the IFC is &quot;very, very careful&quot; in its due diligence when striking deals. &quot;I&apos;m not saying this is taken lightly. We wish there&apos;s no situation like this but I can assure you because of our involvement most of the transactions actually are implemented better than otherwise,&quot; he says. &quot;We learn from failures, trying to improve. We are very focused on the result  Sometimes we have certain investments that turn out not [to] be good, so we have to change.&quot; Concerns about the poverty-focus of IFC investments are not new. In 2011 a report from the World Bank&apos;s independent evaluation group concluded: &quot;Most IFC investment projects generate satisfactory economic returns but do not provide evidence of identifiable opportunities for the poor.&quot; A separate 2011 review, from the UK&apos;s Department for International Development, questioned why the IFC was spending so much in wealthier middle-income countries. The IFC has since increased resources dedicated to monitoring and evaluating its projects, and will this year start rolling out forward-looking IFC development goals (IDGs) to benchmark its impact in everything from health and education to financial services and broad-based growth. Cai says his team will increase its focus on low-income, fragile and conflict states, and work more closely with other parts of the World Bank to &quot;be more ambitious, effectively combine our tools and develop better, more impactful solutions&quot;. This is unlikely to satisfy critics, however, for whom change isn&apos;t coming fast enough. This month, a World Bank audit fuelled further concern from civil society with its conclusion that the IFC &quot;knows very little&quot; about the environmental and social impacts of its investments in financial intermediaries such as banks and insurance companies, which account for a large  and growing  share of its portfolio. Observers have been watching closely for signs of significant reform at the World Bank Group since Jim Yong Kim, the first physician and scientist to lead the group, took over as president last year. In an interview with the Guardian in July, Kim said he&apos;d bring a new sense of urgency to the Bank&apos;s anti-poverty efforts and step up the use of development goals and targets to benchmark success. Appointing Cai was one of Kim&apos;s first major announcements as president, hailed by some as a subtle but significant shift in power within the Bretton Woods institutions towards emerging economies. Cai is the first non-European or American to lead the IFC since Moeen Qureshi, from Pakistan, who was CEO from 1977 to 1980. There is much that other developing countries can learn from China, argues Cai, who wants the IFC to help broker increased south-south investment and the exchange of skills. &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s simple, very simple. You&apos;ve got to start from the basic building blocks,&quot; he says, pointing to infrastructure, education and healthcare. &quot;These are the things, frankly, if you focus on this, put your resources to play, things can change.&quot; His experiences growing up in rural China have given him confidence that eradicating poverty is possible in a generation. &quot;I keep telling people look, when I was growing up I was poor, everyone was poor, [now] the country has been transformed,&quot; he says. &quot;I truly believe poverty reduction is very much doable in a generation, you know, I went through that, my only experience is like that.&quot;",

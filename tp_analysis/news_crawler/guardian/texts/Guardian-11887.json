    "text": "How can students best judge educational quality? It&apos;s a question that seems fitting in light of the huge changes in the sector over the past year, with universities seeing a 8.4% fall in student applications, the unrestricted ABB+ recruitment plan, and the announcement of the Research Excellence Framework (REF)  to name a few. As partly expected, these changes have now led to many students viewing their university experience differently; questioning whether they are getting their money&apos;s worth both educationally and in terms of the wider university experience. In turn, this has placed great pressure on marketing, communications and recruitment teams who have the challenging task of not only making their universities stand out from the rest, but also reassuring students that they made the right choice. With graduate unemployment at an all-time high, the prospect of starting your career with a huge debt, and the personal pressures of completing a higher level qualification  there is a lot at stake for students. Is enough really being done to ensure students are getting all the information they need to make informed choices? And how should this information be presented? Recently universities minister David Willetts claimed that the launch of Key Information Sets (KIS)  data that gives prospective students an insight into student satisfaction, number of contact hours and quality of courses  was the reform he was most proud of. But Professor Graham Gibbs, former director of the Oxford Learning Institute, questions in his latest publication whether this information effectively communicates to students what they are likely to gain from a higher education experience at any particular institution  offering his suggestions as to what might be done to improve it. What do you think constitutes &apos;educational quality&apos; and how can the sector help students judge it better? Join Professor Gibbs and our panel of experts debating these issues in our next live chat, in partnership with the Higher Education Academy, on Friday 18 January 12-2pm.

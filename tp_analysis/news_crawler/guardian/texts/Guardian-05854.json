    "text": "Codemasters takes a sharp left turn with its latest off-roader, ditching the traditional highly polished rally racing for arcade-style, stock-car dirt tracks and destruction-derby mayhem. Despite the (mostly) unlicensed cars and tracks, Dirt: Showdown is unmistakably a spin-off of the Colin McRae Rally franchise, except with added wild handling, explosive collisions and voiceovers boomingly declaring players&apos; awesomeness behind the wheel. Single-player mode offers a variety of courses, including the gymkhana-style &quot;hoonigan&quot;, earning points for drifts and tricks with licensed cars, and the &quot;death match&quot; destruction and survival modes, where a variety of old bangers clock up points for smashing opponents. While rally fans wait impatiently for Dirt 4, Showdown offers a satisfying bang for your buck in the interim  largely, as is so often the case, in the chaotic multiplayer modes. This is bold, brash, looks magnificent and is damn fine fun.",

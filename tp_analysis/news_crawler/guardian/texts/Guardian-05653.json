    "text": "Spare a thought for the poor souls slaving away at developer Double Helix  after turning last year&apos;s messy Green Lantern film into a vaguely tolerable video game, they&apos;ve been tapped to make the game of the movie of the game, Battleship. It&apos;s a valiant effort but much like the film it&apos;s based on, Battleship struggles to find a point or purpose. Packaged broadly as a first-person shooter, the debt both movie and game owe to Bungie&apos;s Halo series is even more apparent  alien designs and technology are uncomfortably similar to Master Chief&apos;s universe. Unlike its onscreen cousin though, the game at least manages to work in some links to the original board game, with strategy elements pitting ship against ship. Overall, it&apos;s a cluttered and unfocused experience, shooting and strategy never quite blending. Movie tie-ins are rarely great, but even with that low expectation this is a sinking ship.",

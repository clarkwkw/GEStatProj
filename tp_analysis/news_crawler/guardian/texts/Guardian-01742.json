    "headline": "Apple faces its 'Nike moment' as ABC Nightline goes inside Foxconn", 
    "text": "Bill Weir of ABC News has provided pictures from inside Foxconn&apos;s assembly lines where it makes Apple devices such as the iPad. Besides the video (below), there is also a photo gallery, showing how thousands of migrant workers show up on a Monday morning, how people sleep eight to a room in the dormitories (where often some will sleep while others get up to work), how gift-wrapped items are done by hand, and the telling line that &quot;The average starting salary at Foxconn is around $285 a month or $1.78 an hour. Even with 80 hours of overtime it considered so low that the Chinese government does not deduct any payroll taxes.&quot; In an accompanying article, Weir talks to one executive at Foxconn who says it is the international pressure that has driven the change.  &quot;You being here is part of the openness, part of the learning, part of the change that Foxconn is undergoing,&quot; said Louis Woo, a former Apple executive who serves as an advisor to Foxconn CEO, Terry Gou. &quot;Of course you can argue that we should have opened up five years ago. Well five years ago, we are under the radar screen, nobody really knows us, we are doing well. Why should I open it up?&quot; I ask if it took such deadly tragedy for Foxconn to rethink the way it treats its workers. &quot;I think absolutely, absolutely, yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;You know, success is the mother of failure. Because we&apos;ve been so successful, successful in the sense that it seems everybody&apos;s happy. Right?&quot;   Weir says that access was unencumbered:   Apple promised complete access, no dog-and-pony, no Potemkin Village, but they denied my repeated requests to interview Apple CEO Tim Cook or the senior vice president of industrial design, Jony Ive. In a three-golf-cart convoy, both Apple and Foxconn reps took us around to a half dozen production lines in Shenzhen and Chengdu, and there were always five to six people with us as we toured the factories and dorms. But aside from suggesting a visit to the counseling center or canteen, they never steered us to interviews and never interrupted.  There are some other telling moments, such as when Weir speaks to a counsellor about the suicides that attracted so much attention:   &quot;So why did the horror happen?&quot; I ask. &quot;There are many reasons,&quot; she says. &quot;We had many scholars here doing research. Of course some (suicide) has to do with the management. But they had more to do with the new generation of migrant workers from the rural areas, their state of mind and how they cope with society. Also it&apos;s hard to make friends here.&quot;   And what about Apple&apos;s shift to letting people like ABC go and see its supplier lines, and letting the Fair Labor Association in to inspect them?   &quot;We call it the &apos;Nike moment&apos; in the industry,&quot; audit inspector Ines Kaempfer [of the FLA] adds. &quot;There was a moment for Nike in the &apos;90s, when they got a lot of publicity, negative publicity. And they weren&apos;t the worst. It&apos;s probably like Apple. They&apos;re not necessarily the worst, it&apos;s just that the publicity is starting to build up. And there was just this moment when they just started to do something about it. And I think that&apos;s what happened for Apple.&quot;   Kaempfer is completely expectant that Foxconn is putting on a show for its inspections, which were not a surprise, and that the visible compliance with safety standards might not be what they do all the time. But the true picture will emerge from the &quot;bottom up&quot; confidential interviews with the staff, Kaempfer says: &quot;the dysfunctionality starts to come up.&quot;",

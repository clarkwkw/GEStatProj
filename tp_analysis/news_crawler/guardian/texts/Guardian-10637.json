    "text": "If the devastating floods across the UK are keeping David Cameron awake at night, I am not surprised: this government&apos;s severe cuts to spending on flood defences are going to leave him in very deep water. The prime minister tweeted at 2.35am on Sunday morning: &quot;Shocking scenes of flooding in Cornwall and around the country. Govt will help ensure everything is being done to help.&quot; Those whose homes have been invaded by torrents of filthy water will agree with the first sentence, but they should be sceptical about the second. As I revealed earlier this summer, the cuts have meant that at least 294 flood defence schemes that were in line for funding have not been built. That clearly has a direct impact: fewer homes are protected than expected. But it also means flood home insurance premiums for those most at risk will soar or, at worst, that those homes will be completely uninsurable. Back in 2000, after widespread flooding, the government and the insurance industry made a pact that expires in June 2013. If the government&apos;s spending on defences kept pace with the rising risk of floods, then the industry pledged to provide affordable insurance to homeowners. Whatever you think about insurance companies, it is clear that the government has not kept its side of the bargain.  Everyone, including ministers, agrees that climate change is ramping up the risk of flooding in the UK as rainfall comes in more intense bursts. It will be the most damaging impact of global warming in the UK. Yet the coalition cut funding by over 25% - hundreds of millions of pounds - on taking office. Over five million UK homes are at risk of flooding, according to the Environment Agency. If it has happened to you then you&apos;ll know the deep trauma that follows your shelter from the world being inundated, forcing you out for months or even years. Without insurance, lives are destroyed. But unless Cameron and environment secretary Owen Paterson increase the funding for flood defences and agree to government support to settle a new insurance deal, as many as 200,000 homes will be left in dire straits. The human argument for doing is obvious and so is the economic argument: every pound spent on flood defences saves about 8 in future damages. The risk of flooding is rising inexorably and so is the risk to Cameron&apos;s government. One major flood in a place that should have been protected could sink his premiership just as George W Bush&apos;s presidency floundered after hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans.",

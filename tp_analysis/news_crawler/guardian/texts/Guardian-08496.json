    "headline": "iPhone 5 shows that Apple still considers NFC as Not For Commerce", 
    "text": "As Apple&apos;s marketing chief Phil Schiller ran through the specifications of the new iPhone 5 on Wednesday, talking of A6 processors and IPS displays, there were three letters that some people were eagerly waiting to drop from his lips: NFC. They were disappointed: the new iPhone does not include Near-Field Communications technology, which almost certainly means that the prospective payment system will struggle for at least another year to gain traction and users. EBay&apos;s chief executive, John Donahoe, often quotes a merchant saying NFC stands for &quot;Not For Commerce&quot;  and dismisses the prospects of NFC being used to turn mobile phones into mobile wallets. Apple&apos;s failure to include it seemed to support that view, even though many rival smartphone makers, including Samsung, HTC and Sony, do put NFC in some models. NFC proponents had hoped Apple would endorse the technology, which passes encrypted data between devices at close range without contact. The idea is that instead of swiping a credit card, shoppers can simply wave their phones at a checkout terminal to pay for their goods. But its absence in Wednesday&apos;s launch left some thinking it will sit in the doldrums until the next iPhone revision. &quot;Anyone hoping NFC would be a reality soon is disappointed,&quot; said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. &quot;Many in the industry were hoping inclusion in the iPhone would be a springboard for more adoption. This takes the impetus away.&quot; Tudor Aw, KPMG&apos;s European head of technology, commented that &quot;the lack of an NFC chip to enable mobile payments is perhaps the biggest surprise and disappointment  The interesting question is whether this omission will mean further delay in mobile payments taking off or if it presents an opportunity for its competitors to take a lead in this field.&quot; Fred Huet, managing director of Greenwich Consulting, thinks it&apos;s the latter: &quot;The decision to omit NFC in the iPhone 5 could cost Apple. It is just a matter of time before the smartphone replaces the plastic card, and by skipping this technology, Apple may have missed a valuable opportunity to take the lead in this market. With over 400m active credit card accounts on file, Apple had a prime opportunity to convert its customers using a sleek mobile payment system tied to the iPhone. Instead they could find that they have fallen behind closest rivals Samsung, Nokia and indeed Motorola, all of whom introduced the technology into their devices last week.&quot; Apple did not include NFC because it is not clear the technology solves any current problems, Schiller told AllThingsD on Wednesday. Instead of embracing NFC, Apple is developing Passbook, a mobile app that pulls together QR-based and smartcode-based loyalty cards, tickets and coupons on the new iPhone. Many analysts consider this an early version of a digital wallet, except Passbook does not let users link their credit and debit cards yet. No adoption Meanwhile, there&apos;s no evidence yet of rival phones driving NFC&apos;s use, says Benedict Evans, who follows the smartphone and tablet business for Enders Analysis. &quot;NFC has been around forever  and gone nowhere.&quot;  He says &quot;there might be half a dozen to a dozen NFC-capable smartphones on the market - Samsung Galaxy S3, new Nokia Lumias, Google Nexus range the new Sony Experia, maybe a couple of others. The key issue for a developer is that you have literally no idea how many of these have been sold.&quot; And the figure for all NFC-capable smartphones compares with 950 Android devices on sale worldwide in the second quarter of the year, according to figures from research company IDC. &quot;Nobody knows which device does have it and which doesn&apos;t,&quot; says Evans. &quot;If you&apos;re an Android developer, do you target it in the device in the expectation it will be there, or not? Of course not.&quot; He contrasts that with Apple&apos;s single-device approach: &quot;For the iOS [iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch software] developers, if Apple has it in the iPhone, they know there will be  35m  100m phones with NFC in a year&apos;s time. And all the people who might be interested in a new technology like that will have bought new phones. So for the developer, there&apos;s a clear value proposition once Apple includes it as a feature.&quot; In fact, the number of credit cards tied to Apple&apos;s iTunes account is a whopping 430m, according to Eddy Cue, Apple&apos;s head of internet software and services, speaking at the iPhone 5 launch. Apple is one of the 10 biggest holders of credit card details online, alongside PayPal, Microsoft&apos;s Xbox service, Sony&apos;s PlayStation Network, and Amazon. But even though NFC technology is backed by the largest US carriers and credit card companies, it has failed to take off in the US because merchants have been reluctant to spend money to upgrade their checkout terminals until NFC is more widely adopted. Evans says that the key point about Apple&apos;s unified approach  where each successive generation of iPhones and iPads gets all the features of the preceding ones  helps developers: &quot;Apple provides a stable target for developers, and a stable product that consumers can adopt knowing it won&apos;t disappear.&quot; He says: &quot;Other companies are just putting things into the phone to see if it will work. It means nobody has any confidence in that feature. But people know that if Apple puts NFC in the next iPhone, it&apos;ll be in the next iPad too. Compare Samsung, which has NFC in the Galaxy S3, but not the Note 10.1 tablet. The people at Apple, by contrast, doesn&apos;t put a piece of technology in unless they know what people are going to do with it. They don&apos;t just put a front camera in the phone until they have their own video calling system (Apple&apos;s FaceTime system) that they know will work.&quot; Experimental Android Android companies have more freedom to experiment, Evans says. &quot;They&apos;ll put the technology in a phone and hope there might be some software support in time. The problem with something like NFC, though, is that to be worth having, it has to be consistent. So just sticking it in doesn&apos;t work.&quot; NFC (which has uses beyond mobile payments) is being backed in the US as a payment solution by Isis, a mobile wallet joint venture in the US between Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile on the carrier side, and financial companies including American Express , JPMorgan Chase and Capital One Financial. But like many new technologies, NFC is hampered by a chicken-and-egg problem. Mobile-phone makers like Apple are reluctant to take on the extra cost and engineering effort of embedding NFC chips because many merchants can&apos;t accept payments this way yet. Meanwhile, merchants won&apos;t install NFC until more consumers have the technology on their phones. After the new iPhone arrived  without NFC  Isis said it was delaying the launch of its NFC mobile payments service for the second time this year. &quot;Isis has placed a massive bet on NFC,&quot; says David Evans, founder of Market Platform Dynamics and an adviser to companies in the payments business. Apple&apos;s continued deferral &quot;is another reason to believe that Isis doesn&apos;t have much promise of getting off the ground.&quot; Driving the market Some might find the idea that Apple can drive or hold back a smartphone technology, when it only comprises about 20% of worldwide sales, ludicrous. Yet Google included NFC in its Nexus S phone, released in December 2010, and spoke then of the possibilities of payment systems, which it is building into its Android mobile software. Other digital wallets have already been developed by companies including eBay&apos;s PayPal and Visa  with the latter pushing their use at the Olympic and Paralympic games in London this summer. Widespread adoption has not followed. The latest digital wallets, though, aim to bring together credit and debit cards, bank accounts, loyalty cards, rewards and coupons in one place so that shoppers can pay for purchases mostly online, but increasingly in stores, too. NFC&apos;s advocates argue it eliminates plastic and cash and can be more secure than magnetic strips. But that alone will not persuade consumers to stop using credit cards in stores because plastic is already so convenient, experts say. &quot;It is a new technology and one that is unfamiliar to users. So that opens up new possibilities for abuse and naivety,&quot; says Charlie Miller, principal research consultant with Accuvant. But he says NFC allows for interesting security options that traditional credit cards don&apos;t, such as account numbers that change dynamically. PayPal is betting other services that make digital wallets more useful will encourage consumers to switch  it is designing a digital wallet that helps consumers do as many things as possible from one place, including buying flight or movie tickets, sending money to other people and tapping coupons, rewards and loyalty cards. &quot;Technology is not what&apos;s going to win this digital wallet war. It&apos;s going to be about the consumer value proposition,&quot; says Carey Kolaja, senior director for PayPal&apos;s product team. Others argue NFC still has potential, partly because merchant incentives from Visa and MasterCard are expected to spark a wave of payment terminal upgrades in coming years. These upgrades will include NFC capability. &quot;It is difficult to buy a new terminal that doesn&apos;t already have NFC technology, and soon it will be impossible,&quot; says Rick Oglesby of consulting firm Aite Group. But the software and service providers behind the terminals will also have to be ready to accept and process payments that come with coupons, loyalty cards and rewards programs. At the moment, most terminals can handle the amount of the transaction and the card number and not much else, Oglesby said. Until this is all sorted out, Apple will likely wait to enter the payments business aggressively, Oglesby and others say. Apple took a similar approach to 4G LTE wireless technology, waiting until coverage was wide enough this year to unveil an iPhone that uses it, Oglesby notes. &quot;They won&apos;t do something until they know a lot of their customers will use the service,&quot; he says.This article was updated: Apple has 430m credit card details, not 43m; Benedict Evans says that his estimate of how many iPhones would have NFC within a year is 100m, not 35m; he did not suggest that 200 Android models have NFC.

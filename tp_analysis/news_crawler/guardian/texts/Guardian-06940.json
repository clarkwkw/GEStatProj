    "text": "The sight of Great Gable&apos;s battlements gathered against the azure blue of a sky feathered with whitest cirrus cloud was iconic. There they loomed above, the Napes Ridges beset by the blush of Great Hellgate Screes to one side and Little Hellgate to the other, and with features like Demon Wall, Brimstone Buttress and Tophet Wall, all quite stark as you cricked your neck to gaze upwards. Such was the view during my recent ascent of Sty Head Pass, which I climbed from Wasdale Head, chancing on young climbers lunching by the stretcher box on top, ropes peeping from under their rucksack flaps. &quot;What are our chances of doing Eagles Nest Ridge Direct?&quot; they asked. How they must have seen me as Methuselah, the oracle speaks. &quot;Go for it,&quot; was my proclamation, unable to resist a tip re the &quot;secret&quot; handhold. But if they thought Eagle&apos;s Nest exciting, then Napes Needle would be more so. Because you have to descend every wrinkle you had first scaled. Descending by the ancient pony track on the far side of the beck, which crosses the base of the huge rift of Piers Gill, the crags overhead are seen to even better advantage; it was the sight that inspired Lakeland author Graham Sutton to write The Damnation of Dr Zinkler, in which, in a dentist&apos;s chair and under anaesthetic, the good doctor dreams of climbing the Needle. As he hauls himself on to the top block, which is actually loose, he unwittingly yanks it from its socket and plunges into the depths of Hades  only to wake and find the dentist with a molar in his pincers having had a tussle to extract it. Discovering the lower slopes of my descent route  which once was sheep-cropped grass  was now trampled by cows and impassable with bracken, I was obliged to cross the glacial torrent of Lingmell Beck back to the far side, tumbling into the icy current in the process.",

    "text": "My most recent piece on comparative anatomy and what that means for palaeontology went down rather well. In particular I was delighted to receive a lovely e-mail from Merald Clark, a science teacher in Florida, with some nice words about the blog and pointing me to a rather nice poem about comparative anatomy and palaeontology. It is perhaps to my shame that I&apos;ve never come across it before, but at least I&apos;m aware of it now.  It&apos;s entitled &quot;P is for Paleontology&quot; by Milton Bracker and can be read here. Once you&apos;ve read it, head back as Merald has composed a reply (or perhaps sequel would be better) and was kind enough to let me post it here: P IS FOR  PALEONTOLOGY  POETRY Merald Clark, 1970 Consider the poets who criticize science,Especially fossils, in open defianceAnd bury them under a torrent of phrasesBecause of small details in most of the cases. And then a melodious verse compositionDegrades fossil research with eloquent dictionImplying that paleontology&apos;s making upStrange creatures that come from the rocks that they&apos;re breaking up. The poets exaggerate our knowledge of dinos,For instance, who said that two-thirds were albinos?It&apos;s hard to determine its diet or sex of itWhen missing the dinosaur&apos;s tail or the head of it. But when in the need for a subject to write onA copy of Science their eyes chance to light onI hope they do not satirize any part of itNot knowing the ads from a graph or a chart of it.* *But I did like the Milton and Brackerish art of it. I can&apos;t imagine there are too many palaeontological poems out there, and I&apos;m not aware of too many songs either (though this and this would of course be the place to start. If you do know of more, do please add them to the comments.",

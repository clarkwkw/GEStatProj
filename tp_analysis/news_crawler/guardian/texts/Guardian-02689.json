In this lovely video, we see a host of flowers from fields of wild daffodils to nectar-rich lungworts buzzing with bees, and even a spring fungus.    In this video, we tag along with Fred Rumsey, a botanist at the Natural History Museum, whilst he recently walked around the Warley Place Nature Reserve. Created by videographer Hannah Wise, who also filmed the popular winter walk video that I shared with you a few months ago, this video combines science and citizen science with beautiful music and with a keen appreciation for the natural beauty that surrounds us. I enjoyed this film because the videographer has a keen eye for detail and composition and such a light touch; she lets the story develop at its own pace, and her careful music choices help make this little video a wonderful experience as we see and learn a little about the different plants in the British Isles.

If so, here&apos;s how!       .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

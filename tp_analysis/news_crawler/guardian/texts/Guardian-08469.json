    "text": "Once again a government is making a dog&apos;s dinner of examination reform. In 2005, Mike Tomlinson wrote a wide-ranging exam review and achieved an almost impossible consensus  only to see it blown out of the water by a general election in which neither the Conservatives or Labour wanted to be the party about to scrap A-levels. This time we have a proposed English baccalaureate certificate, about which there are still many questions. We don&apos;t know for how long students will continue to do GCSEs, and we don&apos;t know what will happen to the accountability and league tables. The death of the GCSE could be much slower than Gove had wanted. One thing is clear, the proposed Ebacc has absolutely nothing to do with evidence, successful reform or standards. The regulator Ofqual has produced no evidence that the GCSE is beyond repair. Neither has it produced any evidence of difficulties with the concepts of modularity and controlled assessment. We don&apos;t know who might take the Ebacc, or whether disadvantaged groups might be adversely affected. Most pressing for a generation of children and their parents is that there seems to be no thought for the potentially lost cohort of young people who will continue to take the existing GCSE up until 2017, an exam now so traduced by Gove that employers and universities will have difficulty in taking it seriously. Despite Gove&apos;s declaration on entering government that he would liberate teachers, there has been no prior consultation with the teaching profession. The consultation is the result of the iron agreement between the two coalition parties rather than any meaningful input from teachers, academics, parents and indeed the young people who will take them. In no other profession would such a significant reform be imposed in such a way. The introduction of the Ebacc brings with it the possibility of moving from a criterion-based exam system to one based on norms, with each grade having a quota of passes allocated to it. The current grade inflation objection is that too many students are getting high grades. Would the same criticism be applied to a rising percentage of people passing the driving test? Here we have perhaps the only government in the developed world determined to drive down the percentage of high achievers. Norm-based exams have another pernicious effect: the possibility of maintaining standards over time is undermined by arbitrary quotas that obscure a consistent picture of what young people can do. Internationally, there is no correlation between this type of reform and countries with outstanding education systems. Singapore&apos;s examination system, so praised by Gove, was achieved by a consensus involving teachers, parents and industry. Finland&apos;s system of evaluation is the product of a society valuing its education system and cross-party consensus. We need to fine-tune the exam system. But this isn&apos;t the way to do it.

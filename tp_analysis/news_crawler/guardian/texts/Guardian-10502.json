    "text": "Undoubtedly destined to be one of the biggest-selling games of 2012, Black Ops II has been under the spotlight since the announcement of its release in February. Developer Treyarch has offered up a great soupy mess of a title, a comically gruff and lovable piece of what might be called war porn, mired in series lore and overloaded with gameplay options. The results veer wildly between entertaining and frustrating, but fans of popcorn thrillers will nonetheless enjoy. The single-player campaign tells a surprisingly ambiguous choose-your-own-adventure yarn about recession-hit multitudes falling under the spell of an anarchic techno-terrorist. Action flits between the 1980s and 2025 as two generations of special forces player characters attempt to bring the antihero and his minions to justice. In keeping with series tradition, player agency is kept to a minimum: shoot, move forward, repeat. Simplified vehicle, climbing and parachuting sections make respectful nods towards variation, but all the action is restricted to tight corridors. This allows for stunning scenes of scripted destruction, but leaves a familiar hollow twang as you wait for other characters to open doors for you. It is paired with Strike Force missions, which run concurrently to the central plot and can be accessed between regular missions. These are an odd mix of top-down strategy and first-person shooting. Players command small units towards various time-restrained goals and can jump in to control any asset on the battlefield while doing so. There is a set limit of units that can be expended on each mission and their demise is permanent. On paper, it probably looked like a great deal of fun, but in practice it is unwieldy and exasperating, which is a shame considering its bold addition to the formula. However, after previous drops in quality, multiplayer appears back to its former glory. Loadout option tweaks, excellently designed maps and the rewarding of all good play  instead of just kills  bring a sense of exceptional balance. Along with the redesigned zombie co-op modes of Tranzit and Grief, which take place in a beautiful retro-futuristic wasteland, there is a wealth of quality content available for the socially minded gamer. Silly but substantial and with ideas above its station  many of which are just ridiculous enough to work  Black Ops will doubtless do the sales regardless. But away from the numbers, if you&apos;re looking to switch off and have fun, this is a hard show to beat.",

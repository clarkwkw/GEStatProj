    "headline": "Will Pope Francis's appointment be a positive step for poor countries?", 
    "text": "When Jorge Mario Bergoglio gave himself the name Francis on Wednesday evening, many people assumed he was linking his papacy to St Francis of Assisi, the 13th century Italian friar known as the great protector of animals. But Chris Bain, director of Catholic development agency Cafod, points out that there are two St Francises. One was the founder of the Franciscan order and is the patron saint of the environment; the other was the much lesser-known Xavier, a Jesuit missionary who travelled the world widely, especially in Asia. Which Pope Francis will the world get? A man strong on progressive ideas and global issues, or a highly conservative one interested primarily in spreading the Catholic message? The choice of name was important but ambiguous, says Bain. &quot;He&apos;s not that well-known outside Argentina. We know he is very strong on social justice; a simple, humble man. It augurs well for global development. We would hope he can also get his message across to the rich world to live simpler lives.&quot; Cafod, one of 160 NGOs that come under the wing of the Vatican, collectively raising and distributing billions of dollars annually in poor communities, hopes the mission of the Catholic church will now move towards tackling poverty. &quot;To have a pope from Argentina, from Latin America, is a momentous decision. It demonstrates we are a universal church, one that is understanding of the fact that most of the church lives outside Europe and North America. I hope he will put global poverty, climate change and environmental degradation higher up the church agenda,&quot; says Bains. Francis may be a passionate defender of poor and disenfranchised but he is a relative innocent in global affairs. His handling of the powerful political forces at work in the faction-riven Vatican is likely to have equal influence on development. The Holy See has a unique place at the UN as a non-member state and permanent observer. The only religion to have this privilege, it has traditionally used it to directly influence policy by negotiating and voting on recommendations just like any national government. It has often used its voice to block consensus at international population and climate conferences, and mostly supports the US. But because of its formidable clout and direct reach to 1.2 billion people globally through its priests and missionaries, it is increasingly lobbied by countries and corporations. &quot;It&apos;s a small state heavily lobbied by the great powers, and seen as an easy listening post. Companies, too, know how influential it is and have been trying to influence it for years. To be fair, the Vatican has developed great expertise on the humanitarian side but not on the environmental side,&quot; says Sean McDonagh, an Irish Columban missionary, author of books on nuclear power and biodiversity, and an adviser to the Vatican. The influence of corporations and the way they try to manipulate the Catholic agenda is clearest in areas such as GM crops, where the Pontifical academy of sciences, based at the Vatican, takes positions on areas of moral and scientific importance, says McDonagh. In May 2009, after 40 scientists visited the Vatican to advise on transgenic crops and the direction of agriculture in developing countries, the Holy See concluded that scientists had both the right and the moral duty to be &quot;stewards of God&quot; by genetically modifying crops. The meeting was organised by academy member Igor Potrykus, a member of the academy, who had developed GM &quot;golden Rrice&quot;, a strain that he has worked tirelessly, but unsuccessfully, to introduce to poor countries for more than 10 years. There were few, if any dissenters or people from developing countries at the meeting and almost all the experts were well-known supporters of the technology. They included a Monsanto employee, and the heads of many organisations and academic insitsutions that have taken large sums from GM companies.Though the group&apos;s opinions were not expressions of the Holy See, the biotech industry hailed the result as a breakthrough, a signal to Catholics that the pope favoured GM. A Wikileaks cable six months later was interpreted by a crowing US analyst as the Vatican being &quot;quietly supportive&quot; of the crops. &quot;[US agricultural company] Monsanto&apos;s representatives have continually pushed the leadership of the Catholic church into giving its blessing to GM crops, and then using that endorsement to undermine local bishops&apos; conferences in Asia, Africa and Latin American that might be opposed to GM technology,&quot; says McDonagh. Whether it is GM crops, abortion, population, poverty, debt, wealth distribution or climate change, in a globalised world the Vatican&apos;s voice is massively important in developing countries. Wikileaks cables showed how the previous pope linked climate change to population. &quot;In the Vatican&apos;s view,&quot; the US ambassador to the Vatican wrote in 2009, &quot;unsustainable lifestyles in developed countries  and not population growth worldwide  is to blame for global warming.&quot;. The ambassador added that the Vatican &quot;will continue to oppose aggressive population control measures to fight hunger or global warming&quot;. The Vatican&apos;s direct influence on poverty, and its traditional closeness to conservative US politics, was most clearly seen in the 1970s and 80s, when it worked with the US government to stamp out &quot;liberation theology&quot;  a Marxist analysis of the Bible, implying preferential treatment for poor people, that became a powerful revolutionary movement to counter some of Latin America&apos;s most unjust, rightwing military regimes. Thousands of priests and bishops worked with social justice movements, landless peasants and indigenous people. More than 100 priests were murdered, including Archbishop Romero of El Salvador, believed to be one of Pope Francis&apos;s most important influences. Pope Francis&apos;s connections to liberation theology are disputed, but Leonardo Boff, the Brazilian intellectual theologian defrocked by the Vatican in the 1980s after publishing a book on liberation theology, told the New York Times: &quot;I am encouraged by this choice, viewing it as a pledge for a church of simplicity and of ecological ideals. What is more, Cardinal Bergoglio comes from the developing world, outside the walls of Rome.&quot;",

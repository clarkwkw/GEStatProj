    "text": "Asura&apos;s Wrath, PS3 &amp; Xbox 360 General Asura is an ancient demigod and one of eight leaders of the purge of the Gohma, a species of demon that&apos;s invaded Earth. When he&apos;s framed for the emperor&apos;s murder he must fight to clear his name  not in the conventional legal sense, but by physically destroying his accusers. The sci-fi-meets-melodramatic-fantasy starts early, with Asura attacking the first boss  a planet-sized beast  with his fists, spontaneously sprouting six new arms for the occasion, thereby giving an accurate impression of the game&apos;s sense of scale as well as its level of general lunacy. It&apos;s all about the fighting, and groundlevel battles are frequently interrupted by much larger ones, with Asura ploughing bodily through office block-sized opponents in his pursuit of angry justice. Delivered in TV-style episodes, some of which require no more interaction than a stray joystick or button press, Asura&apos;s Wrath is an unusual and occasionally exhilarating interactive anime with a powerful taste for the surreal. Out Fri, Capcom, 39.99 SSX, PS3 &amp; Xbox 360     SSX    In line with many Electronic Arts games, snowboarding mainstay SSX loves to whoop it up. Excitable voiceovers, sparkly trails as you pull off big tricks, vertical drops that would be terrifying in a parachute and scores that comfortably head into the tens of millions (once you&apos;ve got the hang of stringing tricks together), it&apos;s all part of EA&apos;s established extreme sports doctrine. Score-led races and trick courses are joined by Deadly Descents  levels so dangerous your character needs to carry an ice axe to avoid plunging into ravines, or wear body armour to live through jarring sets of collisions with scenery. Heli-skiing the world, from Patagonia to the Himalayas, using a wingsuit for moments of blissful flight sounds alluring. Unfortunately, for all its skyscraping tricks and the social competition encouraged by RiderNet, riding your snowboard lacks nuance and tactility. This makes the game a curiously bland experience, despite the game&apos;s habit of hurling you off multiple 1,000ft cliffs, occasionally pursued by avalanches. Electronic Arts, 39.99 Games news     Lego Minecraft Microworld    Also out this week is Final Fantasy Tactics: War Of The Lions for iOS, bringing more than a hundred hours of turnbased strategic gaming joy to iPad, the format for which it was always unknowingly destined  Mario Party 9 on Wii disgraces the world&apos;s foremost gaming mascot to a lesser degree than previous outings  The superbly unhinged Driver: San Francisco is released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in a budget-priced platinum edition, letting a wider audience find out what sort of mischief they&apos;d get up to if you could take control of any car in San Francisco at any time  Silent Hill HD Collection (PS3, Xbox 360) gets you back in touch with everyone&apos;s favourite pyramidheaded monster  Finally, the announcement of Lego Minecraft Microworld is generating considerable excitement, uniting the infinitely modifiable virtual world of Minecraft with its real world counterpart.",

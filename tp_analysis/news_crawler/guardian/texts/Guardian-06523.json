    "text": "No walk through the forest seems complete without ferns. Their varied forms are a delight to explore, their unfolding croziers enchanting and their common names, such as adder&apos;s-tongue, buckler, lemon-scented, spleenwort and hart&apos;s tongue, tease the imagination. Many hug the shade and grow as distinct plants ornamenting a cleft among the roots of a tree, or find a home in a high-up fork in the trunk. Others spread along the limbs to become part of an aerial garden. Then there&apos;s bracken, cloaking vast areas of heathland and invading woodland to the utter dislike of some, a censure that few other ferns attract. On the ground, it often seems to be spreading widely. Past surveys from the air suggest that this is perception rather than reality. When it does spread, it quickly becomes a dominant feature on the landscape, turning areas of sombre-hued heather bright green in the late spring and rich brown in the autumn when it dies down. Walkers in the forest are warned it&apos;s easy to pick up ticks that carry lyme disease when brushing its fronds. In the past bracken was used as roofing, bedding for animals, and chopped to mix in with their feed. At this time of year it makes a vital contribution to the forest&apos;s ecology. It provides cover for the wild gladiolus now starting to flower and only found in the New Forest. More slender than the cultivated varieties, and with fewer flowers per stem than its &quot;wild&quot; cousins in the West Country which are a deeper red, only a small proportion of the plants bloom in any one year. This makes finding them all the more exciting  they are so well hidden under the fern fronds. A bracken stand also makes excellent shelter for a newborn fawn which will be left within it for hours at a time while the doe feeds up after giving birth. They may seem abandoned but each mother knows just where she has left her offspring. They are a sight to enjoy but should be left undisturbed.",

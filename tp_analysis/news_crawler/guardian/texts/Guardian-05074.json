    "headline": "From the Country Diary archive: the stoning of auks", 
    "text": "The severe weather has brought a number of little auks, northern birds of irregular appearance, to our coasts. Professor Newstead* tells me that one which ascended the Dee on tile tide was ruthlessly stoned to death by boys at Chester. A note from a Whitby correspondent is published in this morning&apos;s issue stating that many of this species have been found dead on the shore, but unfortunately the value of his communication is discounted by his remark about the &quot;great black-headed gull&quot; and the &quot;ringed guillemot.&quot; To the best of my knowledge only single example of the first has ever reached Britain, and either the headed or great black-backed gull is meant, whilst the ringed guillemot has been shown to be merely variety of the common species. * Probably Professor Robert Newstead, a naturalist and archaeologist based in Chester.",

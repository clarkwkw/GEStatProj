    "headline": "Can ash dieback be stopped in the UK?", 
    "text": "  5.12pm GMT    My Verdict    All the expert opinion we&apos;ve heard today does seem to suggest that trying to stop the spread of ash dieback is now a lost cause. It&apos;s a deeply depressing thought, but we must grapple with the reality of the situation and work hard not to further aggravate it. The blame game will surely continue for months, if not years, but the focus should now be on learning lessons (for example, urgently reassessing the system/culture of importing trees) and working out what to do with the dead or dying trees (must they really all be burnt on site, or could newly modified biosecurity measures allow for any of them be used by the biomass energy/firewood industry to generate heat and/or electricity?), as well as implementing a strategy for woodland/hedgerow renewal over the coming years and decades. Just imagine the horror if another beloved native species - say, oak or beech - was to be wiped out by a new disease sometime in the future. It should be enough to sharpen our minds never to be so complacent again.       4.33pm GMT       TheDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has just issued a press release regarding this afternoon&apos;s summit:  Businesses, charities and other organisations that care for our woodlands and forests have today joined Environment Secretary Owen Paterson at a tree health summit to generate ideas on how to tackle pests and diseases attacking the countrys trees, including ash dieback. Around 100 people including scientists, campaigners and representatives from charitable groups and government agencies attended the summit where the findings of the mass survey of forests and woodlands were reported. A report on the very latest scientific information was also presented. The top ideas to tackle Chalara identified at the summit, include:  Better awareness raising and information gathering, such as on leaf litter management;  Keep surveying  develop partnerships to continue surveillance for disease and resistance and making use of volunteers; and  Focus action on newly planted trees  dont cut down mature trees. A wide range of other ideas for action were identified, which will be examined in further detail. These and other ideas will now be considered for possible inclusion in a Chalara action plan to be published on Friday 9 November. Speaking after the summit, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: We called this summit to bring together the best ideas from experts and all who care for our forests so we can urgently prepare an action plan on how to tackle Chalara and better protect our trees for the future. Many of the ideas discussed today are extremely interesting, and our scientists and plant health experts will examine them urgently and include the most effective ones in an action plan by the end of the week. The tree health summit follows on from a number of actions the Government has taken to discover the extent of ash dieback and contain its spread. Over the last few days hundreds of people from government agencies and stakeholder groups have urgently surveyed over 2,500 thousand sections of land across the country; the largest operation of its kind ever undertaken. Owen Paterson also chaired a COBR meeting on Friday 2 November to coordinate cross-government action in tackling the disease.        4.15pm GMT       This picture gallery highlighting a new ash dieback research project in Denmark has just launched on the Guardian website:  Ash trees in Denmark and the rest of Europe are being severely hit by the rapidly spreading ash disease. The forestry student Martin Slot, from the University of Copenhagen, is testing hypotheses that might save the species. If successful, Slot&apos;s techniques will be used to maintain and expand the 3-5% of the remaining healthy trees. His working in co-operation with the Danish Nature Agency.        4.05pm GMT       The summit is now under way. The Guardian will be posting a news story as soon as it can, but, meanwhile, hints of the discussions are starting to emerge via Twitter...    Don't panic, don't cut down mature trees, keep involving public - messages emerging from ash dieback summit.&mdash; The National Forest(@NatForestCo) November 7, 2012        3.46pm GMT       Here&apos;s ITV&apos;s Westcountry Tonight&apos;s video report on the Devon nursery that has set fire to much of its stock in the hope that it will prevent being hit by ash dieback.    Updated at 3.48pm GMT     3.40pm GMT       I have just received this reaction from Professor James Brown, who researches plant pathology and plant breeding at the John Innes Centre, Norwich. He is also president of the British Society for Plant Pathology:  Chalara fraxinea has swept through ash populations elsewhere in Europe but evidence from Lithuania, Denmark and Sweden indicates that there is genetic variation in the resistance of ash trees to dieback. Sadly, much of our current ash population may be seriously damaged by Chalara but perhaps the long-term outlook is not so bleak. Ash is dispersed by seed (unlike English elm) and is quite fast-growing. So I feel there are good prospects that natural selection will eventually improve resistance to ash dieback. Can scientists give Darwinian selection a helping hand? Much of the skill in plant breeding involves designing trials to identify plants with high levels of a desirable trait. Doing this for ash trees will be a very significant challenge. To design a trial for Chalara resistance, breeders will need much information about the disease and how the fungus develops within the tree. Also, to be truly effective, plant breeders need to test thousands of plants, not just dozens, so current methods of testing trees will need to be scaled up enormously. Finally, we will need to work out how to encourage resistance genes to spread in the UKs ash population. All of this reinforces the point made by Andy Bailey below, that the UK has far too few plant disease experts. Improving resistance to Chalara in our ash trees will need the combined skills of two professions which are themselves close to extinction in British academia, plant breeding and forest pathology.        3.14pm GMT       Adam Vaughan&apos;s story for the Guardian about Defra&apos;s confirmation today that the number of English counties suffering outbreaks of ash dieback has doubled is now live:  As forestry and plant health experts met at a summit convened by the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced that ash diebackhad been confirmed in the wild in six new counties: Berkshire, Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, Northumberland, Sussex and Yorkshire. The findings add to the discovery of ash affected by the fungus, Chalara fraxinea, in Essex and Kent on Monday, bringing the total number of counties where it is found in the &quot;wider environment&quot; to 10. A total of 115 sites have been confirmed now, with the number in forests and woodlands (61) now outnumbering those in nurseries and recent plantings.        2.38pm GMT       Dr Michael Pocock, an ecologist from the Biological Records Centre at the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, writes:  Based on the current evidence, it seems likely that the spread of ash dieback cannot be stopped in the UK. If this disease takes off and does kill many of our ash trees, in a similar manner to the sequence of events in other places in Europe, there is a potential for very serious impact on our countryside. Trees and woodlands are hugely important in our ecosystems, both in terms of capturing and storing carbon, within cities for decreasing air pollution, for recreation, for landscape aesthetics, and finally of course for wildlife. There are many insects and other animals and plants that depend on ash trees and ash woodland. My colleague Dr Marc Botham says: Over a hundred invertebrates have been recorded feeding on Ash in the Database of Insects and their Food Plants (DBIF), including almost 50 moths, over 25 bugs and more than 20 beetles. Over a third of these have been recorded solely on Ash trees, with a number of mites and flies in particular, entirely dependent on them. In addition, some species like the Dusky Thorn, a moth found throughout England and Wales and whose caterpillars rely on ash, have already declined significantly across their range in the UK. Colleagues at CEH have prepared a summary of data on ash tree distribution for todays meeting. The analysis was carried out using one of our existing long-term, Great Britain (GB) wide data sources, the Countryside Survey (CS). Countryside Survey is a study or audit of the natural resources of the UKs countryside, which has been carried out five times between 1978 and 2008. The ash tree distribution analysis, which can be read here [PDF], uses CS data to estimate how prevalent ash is across the countryside. It confirm that:  Ash is the most common hedgerow tree species (i.e. species growing as a full standard as part of a hedgerow) there are an estimated 2 million individual ash trees (outside of woodlands which contain tens of millions of ash trees) in GB Ash is the second most common individual tree species in GB (after the Oak) there is approx 214.4 (000 hectares) of ash woodland in GB Ash trees increased in number on linear features, which include hedgerows, between 1978 (the first survey) and 2007 (the fifth survey).  Ecological background for ash can be found within the Online Atlas of British and Irish Flora on the Biological Records Centre website including 4 distribution maps. The BSBI Tetrad Map shows that ash has been recorded from most 2km squares - the gaps in England are recording gaps rather than genuine absence. Within the last couple of hours the Countryside Survey team have updated their ash coverage density map for GB.        2.26pm GMT    Twitter reaction      @leohickman This may interest.

By enlisting and supporting members of the public to become citizen scientists, we will be able to monitor and report on the health of trees across the UK, providing a comprehensive early warning system for tree pests and diseases. We will not know the outcome of this bid until September 2013, and success is not guaranteed. Given the urgency of the current tree health crisis we can&apos;t wait for the EU bidding process to run its slow course. We want to close the one million pound funding gap and implement this project now. Growing our own: Our bold vision of doubling native woodland cover involves us buying hundreds of thousands of trees every year to plant on our own estate or to give or sell to others. Recent events have shown that we cannot have confidence in current supply chain processes - a certificate of UK provenance is not worth the paper it is written on. We intend to ensure that we can have 100% confidence that we plant only trees that are truly UK grown and are disease free. We will invest in UK tree nurseries, working closely with them over a long period of time to produce the trees we need, trees in which we can have 100% confidence. In parallel we will support, and/or invest in community and local tree nurseries to help to ensure that new tree planting is truly rooted in the community. Keeping woodland alive: We will host a major conference to bring together specialists from the UK, Europe and the wider world to share knowledge, and to help us to safeguard the conservation benefits of UK trees and woods in the face of an unprecedented wave of pests and diseases.        1.11pm GMT       Peter Marren, the naturalist and writer, has a guest post on the blog run by Mark Avery, a fellow prominent naturalist and former conservation director at the RSPB. Marren has some harsh words for the Woodland Trust&apos;s practice of planting &quot;amenity trees&quot;:  Lets leave aside the idiocy of importing a native tree whose saplings grow by the million in local woods (its a real garden weed round here). What is worrying is the apparent blindness of those who have been busy planting broadleaved trees by the square mile in the conviction that they are helping to regenerate Britains heritage of woodlands. No one is a more enthusiastic planter of amenity trees than the Woodland Trust whose aim is to support, nurture and encourage native woodland and making them more robust in the fact of climate change and disease. The Trust buys its trees from nurseries. It claims to always ask for trees of local provenance, evidently not knowing, and certainly not asking, about how exactly these trees have been nurtured. In fact, many  to judge from the official figures, most  seedlings of ash and other trees are exported to Holland and other European countries for growing on and are then imported back for planting out. This practice is widely known and condoned in the trade, and was certainly known about by Defra and the Forestry Commission. Yet the Woodland Trust admits they knew nothing about it. In their innocence they feel themselves victims (pardon me, but Id say the ash trees are the victims here)... The argument about whether tree planting was responsible will go on. The chorus of denial will be led by the zealots more committed to carry on planting than to admitting to any sense of responsibility for what has happened. It is always harder to propose something that sounds positive than to propound a negative. But can I suggest that, until we can guarantee that nursery trees are free from contagious and fatal diseases we simply stop planting trees?        1.00pm GMT       Mark Kinver, the BBC environment correspondent, has just tweeted...    BBC News website has set up a special webpage on ash dieback - all the latest info will appear here: bbc.co.uk/news/science-e #ashdieback #trees&mdash; Mark Kinver (@Mark_Kinver) November 7, 2012        12.52pm GMT       Dr Gabriel Hemery, chief executive of the Sylva Foundation, a charitable trust that aims to &quot;advance education for the public benefit in the theory and practice of sustainable forest management&quot;, has sent me his reaction:  We should advocate that all woodland owners visit their woodlands without delay and inspect them. We should encourage owners not to fell until we know more about the pathogen. This will avoid flooding the market with ash wood, and avoid the potentially-damaging long-term scenario of narrowing the genetic diversity in the species. In other words, let nature take its course and take our time to observe both susceptibility and resistance. Resistant trees will form the foundation of a future for ash in our country. I think that one of the adaption measures we should take is to accelerate genetic research into resistance in natural populations and in genetic collections that exist already. The work of the Future Trees Trust, for example, deserves our attention and increased financial support. Individual trees within infected woodlands that appear to be healthy will be extremely important. Over time individuals that remain healthy should be flagged as possible parents of a new generation of resistance ash. We can look, too, to continental Europe and build on their research and consider testing some of their material in Britain. We must look at assessing all existing seed orchards and trials to look for evidence of dieback. Genotypes showing disease/resistance should be isolated. In terms of the programme, Future Trees Trust suggest that we should then raise seed from seed orchards and plant out in areas where the pathogen is prevalent (cheaper) or under controlled quarantine conditions (expensive). Monitor every month through the growing season for signs of infection. Identify any individuals that show resistance. This maximises likelihood of finding resistant genotypes as maximum genetic recombination will be present. These are all long-term measures, however. What we need urgently is for the scientific evidence to be synthesised into practical advice for woodland owners, arboriculturists, nurseryman, gardeners and all those who deal with trees. We need clear guidance on how best to minimise infection in the most important woodlands or other sites. In some cases, for example, removing ash leaf litter is likely to reduce sporulation and reinfection, but this will be effective perhaps only for the highest value (e.g. landscape, recreation, biodiversity) sites where this is practicable. We need clear guidance on the risks from the movement of ash wood, especially firewood. Lastly, the issue of biosecurity needs to be advanced and promoted more widely with clear guidance provided to everyone; both professionals and members of the public. Today&apos;s summit and the other actions being taken by the Forestry Commission, Fera and others will address all these issues and we are confident that real progress is now being made.  Dr Hemery also has a personal blog where he has been discussing ash dieback.       12.42pm GMT       Dr David Roberts, a senior lecturer in biodiversity conservation at the University of Kent&apos;s Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, has posted this comment on the university&apos;s website:  With the rising number of sites where ash dieback has been discovered, we probably need to learn to live with it and use this event to learn lessons for the future. Previous experience has shown that governments have a poor record of dealing with these kinds of environmental challenge. We are an island and need to use this as our natural defence. It is likely that some of the trees discovered have been infected with spores blown over from the continent. However it is also clear that a significant number are the result of the importation of nursery stock. Current plant health regulations do more for free trade than actually protecting plants and the environment. We need to use our island&apos;s natural barrier to prevent certain material coming in - but also use the import bottlenecks for better inspection. While the ash trees of the UK may have some level of natural protection in their genetic make-up, maintaining high levels of biodiversity is crucial. By maintaining high levels of biodiversity, we can reduce the chance that a spore of this fungus will find an ash tree. Finally, out of this disaster we have an opportunity to support UK businesses that grow plants in the UK from UK stock. People need to ask what is the origin of any plant or animal product they buy. Many already do this when they buy sustainably harvested fish or ethically raised chicken. Further, we need to be vigilant and report unusual findings, particularly around new developments, where large numbers of big plants have been planted which tend to come from the continent. Plants, animals and their products are being shipped globally and ever more rapidly. Without effect regulation - including inspections - emerging diseases and the escape of invasive species are likely to occur ever more frequently.        11.40am GMT    Twitter reaction    Mary Creagh MP, Labour&apos;s shadow environment secretary, has just tweeted some interesting new revelations...

In summary, they said:  &quot;Gaps in tree cover caused by the loss of ash could actually be good for biodiversity&quot; &quot;It is now too late and the disease is beyond containment&quot; &quot;There are products out there to prevent the fungus, but they are not yet registered&quot; &quot;It was potentially stoppable in the early stages&quot; &quot;Slash and burn and firebreaks don&apos;t really work&quot;  A direct link to the interview can be found here. Or here.    Updated at 11.51am GMT     11.20am GMT       Here are the thoughts of Sue Holden, the Woodland Trust&apos;s chief executive:  Now that ash dieback has been confirmed in at least 33 woods in the wider environment (according to the Forestry Commission map), it could well mean it is too late to save the majority of ash trees in the UK. Questions remain over the way that pest and disease risks are managed and whether our systems are truly fit for purpose to respond to such rapidly changing and complex situations. This is a poor reflection on the degree of priority that has been given to the protection and safeguarding of our natural woodland resources and of the environment as a whole. Unfortunately, it is often the case that until a tragedy such as ash dieback becomes a reality, it is difficult to impress upon people the importance of protecting the UK&apos;s trees and the need to enforce stricter controls to prevent new pests and diseases entering the country. Ash dieback has become one more of a whole range of pests and diseases already present in the UK, all of which pose a threat to our native woods and trees. The Woodland Trust has been working to raise awareness of these issues for a number of years and has drawn attention to the need to enforce stricter measures to stop the import and spread of tree disease as part of our response to the govt&apos;s Tree Health Action Plan published last year, and as part of our report State of the UK&apos;s Forests, Woods and Trees (Dec 2011). Following the outbreak of Chalara Fraxinea, we are pleased to see government taking these issues more seriously. We are working with organisations such as the Wildlife Trusts, CLA and National Trust to ensure that collaboratively we are doing everything possible to deal with ash dieback, whilst waiting for further advice from government scientists. Going forward we will also do everything we can to help tackle the problems presented by other pests and diseases threatening the UKs trees to ensure they are afforded more robust protection for the future. While we are prepared to do everything we can to save it, we may have to accept that it is too late for the ash. It is not too late for our other native trees.        10.59am GMT       Dr Andy Bailey, a senior lecturer in molecular plant pathology and fungal biology at theUniversity of Bristol&apos;s school of biological sciences, has sent me an email highlighting thatnew plant diseases &quot;occur quite frequently&quot; and that to better tackle them we &quot;ought to teach more biologists&quot;:  Ash dieback is just one of a number of plant diseases to have hit the news over recent years. Others impacting on forestry include Phytophthora ramorum which infects larch, but also various ornamental shrubs and Dothiostroma needle blight which is starting to have severe effects in pine plantations whilst in gardens, the downey mildew disease of busy lizzies has reduced their availability. This shows that ash dieback isn&apos;t a unique event, but that new plant diseases occur quite frequently. The best way to have effective control is to have well-informed people who can identify these diseases and put control measures in place before the diseases have the chance to become established. The British Society of Plant Pathology recently did an audit of UK universities to see which ones had significant teaching about plant disease in their biology, agriculture, horticulture or forestry courses. This highlighted that comparatively few have significant teaching in this area. If we want to be able to respond effectively to new diseases, we ought to teach more biologists about them.        10.50am GMT       Louise Gray in the Telegraph is reporting the views of various experts:  The Ash Dieback crisis is now beyond containment and will have a greater impact than Dutch Elm Disease.        10.45am GMT       Tony Kirkham, head of the arboretum at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has told me:  I believe that it will now be extremely difficult to eradicate this disease from the UK. It is up to all of us, who work daily with trees, to take proactive and preventative measures and share our knowledge with each other. (For more information on how to spot the symptoms please see - http://www.kew.org/news/chalara-dieback-of-ash.htm) In most hedgerows across the UK ash trees are the dominant species, especially since the loss of the elm in the 1960s and 70s. The disease could get hold and run quickly through the hedgerow system. The one advantage of ash over elm is that most of the wild ash that we have in the UK are seed raised with a huge gene pool, compared to the elm, which is propagated from root suckers. The evidence from research in Finland is that some ash trees are resistance to the disease. This could be due to differences in the chemistry of the trees and justifies further research.        10.16am GMT       I&apos;ve received the following comment from Guy Barter, the chief horticultural advisor at the Royal Horticultural Society:  As Ash dieback appears to be widely distributed in woodland in eastern England, with the potential for re-infection from across the North Sea, current attempts to destroy infected trees and create a &apos;firebreak&apos; seem optimistic. The sheer numbers of potential trees in woods and indeed trimmed as part of hedges in rural areas are a huge challenge to monitor and, where necessary, cull. In urban areas access to ash trees is difficult; they are commonly found as self-sown seedlings on industrial sites, in private gardens and by railways for example. At this time in the season there is a very limited opportunity to detect early infections before leaves fall. Fallen leaves will, if infected, shed spores next summer. Although longer infected trees will usually show characteristic bark damage newer infections will be harder to spot until next summer. Reports from Scandinavia suggest that the disease spreads by up to 20 miles per year. In contrast infections associated with inadvertently planting infected young trees should be slightly easier to counter as there is traceability of the trees in question from nursery records. Unfortunately it seems likely that the disease will be much more widely found next summer and call into question the chances for successful control. The only hope then would be that some trees will prove resistant, as is reported from Denmark, and these would be the nucleus of a new stock of ash trees. It is unclear as yet how much hope can be put on this.        10.03am GMT       The Forestry Commission has declined my offer to provide a response to the headline question. (I spoke to Dr John Morgan, head of the Forestry Commission&apos;s Plant Health Service, in September before the fungus told hold.) But it has pointed me to its dedicated Chalara webpage, which has lots of information about the disease. It includes a link to this video produced by the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) which provides a &quot;brief history&quot; about the disease...            Fera has also produced another video explaining the &quot;life cycle and symptoms&quot; of Chalara fraxinea...                 9.34am GMT       A frantic effort by officials and volunteers is already under way to report and track locations where the fungus has been found. The Ashtag website offers smart-phone apps, an interactive Google map and a &quot;How to identity Chalara ash dieback in the field&quot; video to enable anyone to join in.                 9.14am GMT    Welcome to the Eco Audit    Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is hosting an emergency summit today to discuss with officials, scientists, landowners and conservationists how best to tackle the spread of ash dieback, the Chalara fraxinea fungus which has been detected with increasing frequency and geographic reach in nurseries, plantations and woodland across eastern parts of the UK in recent weeks. The fungus, which fatally attacks the crown of ash trees, is already widespread across many parts of continental Europe. But many experts seem downbeat about the chances of preventing it wiping out ash trees in the UK within a decade. The government has also faced criticism for being too slow to act in the period before the fungus took hold in the UK. Can it be stopped? What are the options? Please leave your thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict.    ",

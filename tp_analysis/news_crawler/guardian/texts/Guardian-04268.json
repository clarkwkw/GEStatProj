    "text": "Jean McFarlane, Lady McFarlane of Llandaff, who has died aged 86, was one ofnursing&apos;s great pioneers. Her work on what has come tobe called the nursing process is now an integral part of every nursing curriculum and every nurse&apos;s practice. In 1974 she was appointed England&apos;s first professor of nursing, at Manchester University, where she developed adegree course and established the country&apos;s first professorial nursing unit. She was also responsible for England&apos;s first nursing research programme (theStudyofNursing Care), and wasmentor tomany of those who became the nurse leaders of the nextgeneration. Although most of her career was spent in England, Jean was born inCardiff, the youngest offive children, and her pride in her Welsh roots was reflected in the title she took when she was made a life peer in 1979. Shewent to Howell&apos;s school, Llandaff, and after initial nurse training atStBartholomew&apos;s hospital, London, returned to Wales to train and then work as a health visitor in Cardiff. Theperspectives onhealthcare affordedby her six years&apos; health-visiting experience strongly influenced the nursing degree that she established laterat Manchester  afour-year programme which prepared nurses to work both inhospitals and in community settings, as either district nurses or health visitors. In the early 1960s, when Jean qualified as a nurse tutor and took a post as education officer at the Royal College of Nursing in London, the idea that nurses might benefit from a university education and even undertake research was greeted with incredulity, both inside and outside the profession. AttheRCN, she became one of a small group of educators who formed the Association for Integrated and Degree Courses in Nursing and began to try to overcome these prejudices. In the absence of any university programmes in nursing, Jean took a BSc in sociology at Bedford College, London, and amaster&apos;s in manpower studies at Birkbeck College. Then, in 1967, on the initiative ofMarjorie Simpson, a former colleague at the RCN then working at the Ministry of Health with a specific responsibility to develop research in nursing, came an invitation to lead the Study of Nursing Care. The enterprise was conceived asaseries of linked individual projects on various aspects of nursing, in which students would also learn research methodology and gain academic qualifications. In the culture of the time, the initiative was revolutionary, andtheresults were equally startling. Some ofthe studies, produced over a number of years, are today seen as classics, and from the first cohort of six students later came the new generation of professors of nursing. Over and above the massive task of co-ordinating the programme and supporting the students, Jean&apos;s particular contribution was her book The Proper Study of the Nurse (1970), which was both a synthesis of the first six studies and an argument for nurses to undertake research into their own practice and to develop the academic discipline of nursing. In 1969 Jean handed over the project to become the RCN&apos;s director of education, then perceived as the leading post in nursing education in the UK. But following an internal reorganisation, she resigned  and was immediately snapped up by Manchester University. She remained there, as professor of nursing and head of department, until her retirement in 1988. She was able not only to initiate some of the most exciting developments in nursing  the first degree in nursing, the first professorial nursing unit, the first joint appointments for nurses between a university and a hospital, the development of &quot;grand theory&quot; in nursing, the introduction of the systematic problem-solving approach known as &quot;the nursing process&quot;  but also to act as support and mentor to many who were struggling in a still-hostile environment. My personal debt to Jean is immense. I was a rebellious and arrogant young student nurse, and she took me under her wing, listened patiently to my sometimes wild ideas, supported me when those ideas got me into trouble and encouraged me to pursue them. Later, she guided and encouraged myresearch and academic career. I am proud to have been one of her &quot;babies&quot;. Jean&apos;s influence extended far beyond Manchester. Between 1976 and 1979 she served as a member of the royal commission on the NHS. She was one of the first fellows of the RCN, and the first chair of the RCN representative body (now called RCN congress). Inthe House of Lords, she was amember offour select committees. She served on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and was national president of the Girls&apos; Brigade. She was acommitted Christian, a staunch member of her local church, and between 1990 and 1994 a member ofthe general synod of the Church ofEngland. She took particular interest in the hospice movement, and was until 2008 vice-president of St Ann&apos;s hospice inHeald Green, Cheshire.

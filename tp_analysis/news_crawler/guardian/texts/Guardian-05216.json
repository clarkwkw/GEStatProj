    "text": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Google at Work on an &apos;Entertainment Device&apos; - NYTimes.com More:   The device, which exists as a prototype and will eventually be sold as a branded item to consumers, is the company&apos;s most significant venture into hardware. While the initial purpose of the device will be for streaming music, the eventual use could be much wider.  Google&apos;s Foray Into Hardware Will Be A Total Disaster -- Here&apos;s Why Matt Rosoff writes:   Google has never shown that it has any of the characteristics necessary to build, market, and sell consumer goods.  Urgent Call to Inaction from the W3C &gt;&gt; Webkit Developments Developer Dave Balmer is not pleased:   Rarely do I find a need to call out the W3C folks (or anyone, for that matter), but the recent post by Daniel Glazman (@glazou), co-chair of the W3C CSS working group, pushed me over the edge. In his article, he calls for everyone to, get this, stop using -webkit in their sites. He equates webkit, now a popular engine for most new mobile browsers, to IE6. Moreover, he calls it a &quot;threat to the open web&quot;. Seriously?  Google says it won&apos;t support fair licensing in open standards as Apple, Microsoft, Cisco have &gt;&gt; Apple Insider Don&apos;t be... anyway:   In a distinct departure from the agreement voiced between Apple, Cisco and Microsoft regarding the need for fair, transparent, understandable and consistent licensing policy for open standards, Google has promised to continue to wage Motorola&apos;s increasingly hostile patent wars.   The letter from Google is included here. It&apos;s deeply complex legalese, where you need legal training to spot the loopholes. But the key thing is that Motorola says it will claim up to 2.25% of the sale price of a device that uses its essential patents. It would only take 45 of those and your profit is zero, no matter what the price. Does the 2.25% cover every patent owned by MMI and used in a device? Would it injunct over an essential patent? Deeply complex. But Google&apos;s language is ambiguous where it doesn&apos;t need to be. Google developing home entertainment system &gt;&gt; WSJ.com Would you buy one?   Google Inc. is developing a home-entertainment system that streams music wirelessly throughout the home and would be marketed under the company&apos;s own brand, according to people briefed on the company&apos;s plans. The effort marks a sharp shift in strategy for Google, which for the first would time would design and market consumer electronic devices under the Google brand. The company has up to now mainly focused on developing the operating system that powers devices such as smartphones, tablets and televisions and allowing other companies to build and brand the hardware that uses it. Google&apos;s Android unit has led a multi-year effort to develop the new entertainment device, which is expected to be unveiled later this year, people familiar with the matter said.   Note that it&apos;s from inside the Android team - not a Motorola tieup. (Yet.) And: how big is the market for music-streaming devices? Isn&apos;t that what Sonos does at the high end and things like Logitech and others at the low end? Windows on ARM, With Next Version of Office, to Arrive With Windows 8 &gt;&gt; AllThingsD This is colossal:   Sinofsky also said that the Windows-on-ARM machines will come with several Office apps -- Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote -- that have been tuned to run in a very battery-efficient manner. But Sinofsky said that, although those applications will run in the traditional Windows desktop, they will be the only programs allowed to do so, other than components of Windows itself. &quot;There are no other compiled dekstop apps that are available,&quot; Sinofsky told AllThingsD. All of the other apps for Windows on ARM will be the new-style &quot;Metro&quot; apps. Windows 8 for Intel and AMD chips, by contrast, will be able to run all of the kinds of programs that have traditionally run on Windows, inside a Windows 7-like desktop environment.   Let&apos;s just repeat that: &quot;There are no other compiled dekstop apps that are available&quot;. It&apos;s going to be a totally new world on those tablets. Can it still be called &quot;Windows&quot;? $1 million to build a data platform &gt;&gt; ScraperWiki Data Blog Amazingly impressive: Liverpool&apos;s ScraperWiki goes from strength to strength (financially):   Today we closed our round of investment from Enterprise Ventures and Blue Fountain. In total, provided we hit certain milestones next August, and with the Knight Foundation money, this means we have a cool $1,000,000 of capital.   And also now has the Canonical CEO joining to chair the board. Bonus points: she&apos;s female, improving the gender ratio. Twitter statistics for the Superbowl as an infographic &gt;&gt; Exact Target It&apos;s an infographic, so don&apos;t blame us when it offends your tolerance for bright orange. Nokia Belle update goes live: no laser gun &gt;&gt; Nokia Connects Symbian users, behold:   This widely anticipated update for Symbian brings a load of new features. Instead of three home screens, you now will have six. This will let you personalise even more and keep all of your favourite things a press away. The improved Nokia Belle interface also adds HD video recording capabilities at 30 frames per second, a new notification bar which lets you see if you have any missed calls, messages emails or reminders etc, as well as the ability to turn on and off processes like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.   Requires connection to a PC. Seems to be available widely in the UK. (Thanks @rquick for the link) You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

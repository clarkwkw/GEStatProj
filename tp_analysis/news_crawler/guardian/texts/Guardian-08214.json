    "text": "When thinking about philanthropy&apos;s impact on higher education, it is worth considering the role of the state through the lens of Robert Musil&apos;s The Man Without Qualities, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri do: &quot;That people should love each other, and that it takes a firm hand in government to make them do it, is nothing new. So why should it suddenly be a case of either/or?&quot; The government&apos;s overarching strategy at the present moment, in many areas, centres upon erosion of its own sovereign power  the supposed big society and the small state. This is done, of course, in the name of freedom and a belief that the invisible hand of the market is the best driver of progress. On the other hand, the economic problems caused when the most vulnerable are forced to rely on this selectively bestowed freedom is their enforced servitude. At present, we cannot rely on government to ensure the background conditions necessary for equality of opportunity. If anything, previous positive developments are being eroded by a combination of funding cuts and a significant shift in the terms of discourse, both emanating from the upper echelons of power. The yellow brick road to the world of work leads to unpaid internships that turn out to be mere tricksters (the man behind the curtain) and the once flowing canal of fee-free HE has run dry. It seems that, whether we like it or not, the world needs philanthropy and, despite the many excellent arguments that point out its injustice, the university system is no exception. Certain aspects of the university have, of course, been dependent on philanthropic funding for a long time, most notably, research. Alongside the cyclical reinforcement of wealthy alumni giving back to wealthy universities, grant-makers such as the Wellcome Trust, the British Academy and a host of others have been responsible for much funding where the research councils were over-stretched. In many cases the pressures brought to bear on researchers and research managers have been positive, as seen in the Wellcome&apos;s insistence on open access publications. That said, as Alice Bell succinctly pointed out on Twitter, this model is fundamentally anti-democratic. On the other side of the coin, philanthropic efforts are emerging for those who have been refused entry to postgraduate areas of academia on the basis of economic class into which they were born. These initiatives act as a democratic (in the broadest definition of demos/kratos  power to people) correctives against the coalition government&apos;s anti-democratic efforts. For example, a nascent northern project, Minerva Pathway, is being developed with the intent of unlocking access to the broader world of work for those who face multiple personal and social barriers to entry. The project also explicitly aims to &quot;open up access to postgraduate education for those seeking a career in a strategic profession where a masters degree or a PhD is a real-terms prerequisite for an entry-level role&quot;. Although this seems like a mirror to private school scholarships, this project is taking aim at the mean-minded &quot;get a job, any job, and count yourself lucky&quot; approach which the coalition has been pitching at those who hadn&apos;t been able to access positive career development opportunities. The wider picture here is one of evening the odds and challenging the reversal of social progress that current policy and rhetoric represents. Should it attract enough initial capital, Minerva Pathway would fulfil a valuable social function by opening up access What we&apos;re seeing is indicative of a wider cultural shift. In the broader economy, there&apos;s a sea-change in the social sector and the way that wealth is channelled to good causes. As with social lending, the laudable and legitimate expectation of a measurable social outcome is sitting alongside the new, and pernicious, belief that academia and charity must also provide a financial return. That creating knowledge or providing a service to society isn&apos;t itself worthwhile enough  someone has to get rich, even though that someone will usually be quite wealthy already, certainly far wealthier than those expected to &quot;buy&quot; the service their money finances. All of this speaks directly to the kind of society we want to live in, the values we hold, and the breadth and openness of how we conceptualise relationships with those who have a surplus of money and those experiencing a deficit of money. Why is philanthropy needed, and what do philanthropists expect to see in return for their largesse? This is the struggle that we&apos;re starting to see play out in the higher education and post-HE arena, with the Wellcome Trust and projects like Minerva Pathway demonstrating positive, socially ethical outcomes even as others focus more on the money. Academia is right to be wary of philanthropy, for all the well-known reasons. However, in a time of pragmatic need, an increasing reliance upon this mode of funding seems inevitable. Furthermore, in certain, tightly defined, scenarios, these efforts can provide a regulative corrective to the problems of small-state, neoliberal government and stave off the wholesale colonisation of higher education a little longer.

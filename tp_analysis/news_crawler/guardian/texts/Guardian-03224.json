    "headline": "Country diary archive, 18 April 1912: The return of the willow wren", 
    "text": "Yesterday was the day of the willow wren; its sweet song was uplifted in every wood and spinney. There are, no doubt, many more willow wrens to come, and a few arrived before, but the first really large migration wave of willow wrens reached this district some time between Sunday evening and Tuesday morning. In many marshy spots the delicately tinted mayflower is now fully out. Some days ago I saw flowers on the flower-table in the Warrington Museum, and now I have a small but very full clump of mayflowers in my own garden. E.H. - Yes, the tree sparrow is to some extent migratory; I have one which was killed against the lantern of the Spurn lighthouse, and the bird is fairly well known at the lights. But the tree sparrow is not purely a summer visitor; indeed there are as many birds here in winter as in summer. It is, like very many other species, both migratory and resident.",

    "text": "The UN&apos;s International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that 21 million people around the world are engaged in forced labour, but what are the causes and consequences of this modern-day form of slavery? How far is globalised trade driving modern slavery as it increases the demand for ever-cheaper goods? Why does slavery still exist almost 150 years after most countries abolished it? And what should governments do now to tackle the trafficking and exploitation of people for profit?  Annie Kelly hears guests including: Beate Andrees, head of the programme to combat forced labour at the ILO; Romana Cacchioli, of Anti-Slavery International; Andrew Wallis, chief executive of Unseen; Leonardo Sakamoto, who covers slavery for Reporter Brazil, and a first-hand testimony from a Chinese person who has experience trafficking.  Relive the debates on our talk point",

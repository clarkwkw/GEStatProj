    "text": "Next week, 20 years after the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro, politicians, businesses, activists, NGOs and more will meet again for Rio+20. The UN describes the conference as &quot;a historic opportunity to define pathways to a safer, more equitable, cleaner, greener and more prosperous world for all&quot;. What does this mean to you? What message do you want to send to the summit? Perhaps you care about education and sanitation like Steven above? Maybe you think decent jobs are the key, or that urbanisation means our cities must be the focus?     Isaac John Okot, with his message to the Rio+20 summit. Photograph: Ben Parkinson    We&apos;d love to see your messages from around the world submitted to our Flickr group. We&apos;ll feature some of our favourites on guardian.co.uk and maybe in the print version of the Guardian as well. For inspiration, take a look at these brilliant galleries of readers&apos; global education messages or messages to UN Women. Maybe you have a broad hope for your life and family like Isaac. Or maybe you want to send a message about one of Rio+20&apos;s seven priority areas  decent jobs, energy, sustainable cities, food security and sustainable agriculture, water, oceans and disaster readiness. We want your messages in pictures submitted to Flickr, or to development@guardian.co.uk if you have any problems. Please note, by posting your pictures in this group, or sending them to us in response to this request, you agree to let us use them on our site and potentially in the newspaper (copyright remains with you at all times, and you will be credited). We&apos;re looking forward to seeing your pictures.",

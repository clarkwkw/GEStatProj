    "headline": "Twitter token limit criticised as Falcon Pro hikes app price to deter buyers", 
    "text": "How much would you pay for a Twitter client? Does 87.48 (or $132.13) sound like a reasonable amount - when almost all of them are free, or cost a couple of pounds? But that&apos;s the price put on the Falcon Pro for Android, a Twitter client, after its developer Joaquim Vergs ran into Twitter&apos;s policy - introduced last August - of limiting the number of &quot;tokens&quot; (in effect, users of the app) available to new third-party clients to access the service to a maximum of 100,000. The app has been on sale since November. The intention of raising the price isn&apos;t to make money from people; it&apos;s to actively discourage anyone from buying the app, while allowing those who already have to continue to use it and get updates. Though the 100,000-token limit is a problem for any Twitter app, because it puts a cap on success, the problem has been worsened, according to Vergs, by piracy of his app via Google Play&apos;s store. That has meant that the app - which used to be priced at $1 - was being &quot;cracked&quot;, copied and shared or resold by others, but with each token activation still counting against Falcon Pro&apos;s total. In addition some of the tokens may have been used by people who did buy the original app, but then decided to get a refund within the 15-minute window that Google allows.  &quot;As Twitter doesn&apos;t give any information or detail about the user tokens used, it&apos;s very hard to estimate exactly how many tokens are due to piracy or to inactive users,&quot; Vergs told the Guardian. Falcon Pro is the second paid-for app to have publicly run into Twitter&apos;s 100,000 limit. In November Tweetro, a free app for Windows 8, hit the same limit, and pulled it from the Windows 8 Store and relaunched it as a paid app: &quot;Had these restrictions not been imposed on us, we&apos;d be more than happy to continue distributing the app freely as the exposure we&apos;ve received from doing so has been amazing. Unfortunately, the circumstances have forced us to put a price tag on it to justify ongoing development. Of course, these restrictions also apply to Tweetro+ meaning we&apos;ll only ever be able to distribute it to a limited number of people,&quot; the developers wrote. Vergs told the Guardian that his app had appeared on one pirating site within hours of a new version being released, and that there seemed to be another &quot;community black market&quot; where users uploaded pirated APKs - the core of the app - and share them.  Vergs says however that he&apos;s not worried by the piracy, even though it has been an issue for a number of paid app developers. &quot;It&apos;s never been such a big issue for me until now, I believe that users that download a pirated version of my APK [app] probably wouldn&apos;t have bought it in the first place, either by choice or by obligation.&quot; Some countries still don&apos;t offer access to the paid version of the Google Play store, he points out. &quot;I write Android apps as a hobby,&quot; Vergs explains. &quot;My day job provides enough that I don&apos;t have to worry about piracy that much. The real problem here is the limitation in tokens, which gets reached very quickly when it&apos;s not controlled. If I wasn&apos;t limited in users, piracy would not be so problematic. My real concern is having new buyers complain that they bought an unusable app.&quot; Falcon Pro remain on &quot;sale&quot; at its hugely high price so that existing users will be able to get updates - while discouraging potential new &quot;buyers&quot;. Piracy in Google Play has been a concern to many big-name developers, but Vergs&apos;s experience is one of the first where it is thought to have driven an app into Twitter&apos;s tokens roadblock.  &quot;I&apos;ve learned recently that if you really want to protect your app, there&apos;s ways to prevent piracy by changing your business model (free app with in-app purchases seems to be the most efficient), or by providing critical information to enable your service via a private server. No protection is perfect, but it usually dissuades the common pirates who don&apos;t like to look at code,&quot; Vergs told the Guardian. Twitter has told Vergs that it won&apos;t extend the 100,000 limit for his app - the same approach that it took with Tweetro - despite getting more than 6,000 signatures at an online petition. Now Vergs is considering radical action: resetting the app&apos;s Twitter keys, so that every user has to log in afresh. &quot;Every user would have to re-login into the app to secure their &apos;user token&apos;, while I&apos;d enforce security to delay pirates from using it as long as possible,&quot; he explains. &quot;With that reset, I&apos;m starting fresh with a new set of 100,000 user tokens, and I&apos;m hoping this way it will free up all the unused tokens that are still active.&quot; He hopes that will allow him to keep selling the app - at the original price - for longer &quot;and at least allow a few more new users to discover and enjoy the app, while I finish the latest features I want to implement to make the app complete.&quot; He adds though that &quot;I&apos;m not entirely sure of what will happen next. I can only hope that the token cap won&apos;t be reached again in a matter of days. I really wish Twitter would give developers some insight to be able to monitor the consumption of user tokens.&quot;",

    "text": "When former Hollywood producer Alexander Ross began his doctorate on the film studio business model at London Metropolitan University&apos;s business school, he was confident he had picked the right place. &quot;My first degree was at Cambridge, but I chose to do my PhD here because it was local and offered a great deal financially. Plus I would get to work with some of the top people in my field,&quot; he says. Yet just as he was preparing to write up his thesis, everything started to go wrong. In December, Stephen Perkins, dean of the business school, announced that the school would be cutting 40% of staff and three-quarters of its courses &quot;to ensure the university&apos;s future sustainability&quot;. Shortly before this, Ross&apos;s main supervisor, whom he describes as a &quot;fantastic&quot; professor, left the school voluntarily. Ross had no idea what this meant for him  and he couldn&apos;t find anyone to answer his questions. &quot;The university never even contacted me to let me know that my director of studies had left,&quot; he says. Originally, Ross had a &quot;dream team&quot; of internal and external supervisors, including one in Cambridge and another in New York. But in November, he was told this would no longer be allowed. &quot;Overnight, the university changed the rules and said my supervisors had to come only from my department,&quot; he says. &quot;Right now, I am trying to write up as fast as I can, in the hope that there will still be someone there to examine me by the time I submit my thesis.&quot; Ross&apos;s plight is symptomatic of London Met&apos;s battle for survival. In January 2010, the university was found guilty of misreporting domestic student numbers and told to return 36.5m of public funding. The governing body resigned en masse and a new vice-chancellor, Malcolm Gillies, was parachuted in. Then last August, London Met hit the headlines again, when its right to recruit and teach foreign students was withdrawn, after the UK Border Agency uncovered a systemic failure to monitor them. On 9 April this right was reinstated. But the international scandal has taken its toll  on both student numbers and university finances. For the 2012-13 academic year, enrolments were down 43%. The ban had a &quot;big effect on income&quot;, Gillies concedes. As a result, Gillies has embarked on a radical cost-cutting exercise and this week will publish a new three-year business plan. &quot;We have to make sure [last week&apos;s decision] is a restoration of reputation  and we ourselves have an important part to play in that,&quot; says Gillies. He argues that making the sprawling university much &quot;leaner&quot; is essential. The new strategy will outline further cost-saving measures. It follows the announcement in 2011 that the number of courses on offer would be cut from 557 to 160, with philosophy, history and the performing arts among those for the chop. As a result, more than 200 academic jobs were cut last year. The business school is now consulting on plans to axe a further 150 posts this year, and the union predicts many will leave voluntarily. The University and College Union has refused to rule out industrial action. &quot;There is quite a lot in the new strategy we don&apos;t like,&quot; says Cliff Snaith, secretary of the London Met branch of the UCU. &quot;But our main problem is that it is based on a very superficial understanding of how the university works. I wouldn&apos;t rule out [strike] action as there is anger and resentment throughout the university and particularly within the business school.&quot; Gillies says the strategy is driven primarily by course popularity. &quot;Student numbers tell you something that is really very important,&quot; he says. &quot;Also you are looking at the coherence of your programme. You are saying &apos;What can the department do best so that it is most distinctive?&apos;&quot; But a young lecturer disagrees. &quot;Trying to say it is business as usual internally isn&apos;t working. Staff and students are struggling because of the lack of certainty,&quot; he says. So far, staff feel a coherent implementation plan is some way off. &quot;My impression is that the middle managers don&apos;t really know what&apos;s going to happen,&quot; says a former department head. &quot;They are asked to produce lists of who they want and who they could do without, but they don&apos;t know what will come of that.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think senior management has communicated any sort of vision. No matter what mess you are in, you&apos;ve got to have some vision that you offer to staff to make them feel you are moving in a certain direction.&quot; The restructuring and consequent job insecurity are having a drastic impact on staff morale. &quot;Everyone is very scared of talking within London Met at the moment,&quot; says another junior academic. &quot;There are lots of meetings happening in coffee shops, and it&apos;s all hushed voices. It&apos;s really quite awful.&quot; &quot;It feels like a closing-down sale and nobody knows what will be left at the end of it. People are very disheartened.&quot; As a result, Snaith says work-related illness has increased significantly. &quot;We have got ridiculously high levels of sick leave at the moment,&quot; he says. Gillies refutes any suggestion of a lack of vision and points to this week&apos;s new three-year plan. &quot;The university has got a clear strategy, but we are coming to the end of its period,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ll be coming out with a draft strategy to 2015 this week. We are having to address a variety of issues, but our commitment to affordable quality education is undiminished.&quot; He adds that foreign students are such a big part of the university that it would have been impossible to come out with any new business plan before last week&apos;s decision was confirmed. The interests of students, he says, are just as vital as those of staff. He expresses concern that PhD students like Ross are feeling abandoned. &quot;It is worrying to hear  because we have an obligation to each of those students. That obligation inevitably gets tested when we are going through change.&quot; Many students and staff fear that London Met has become a tarnished brand. Yet Gillies argues that glossing over issues would be wrong. &quot;London Met has had a number of problems and London Met plays them out publicly,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to accept the consequences of that.&quot; As for Ross, although he is angry about how he has been treated, he is also sad that London Met is struggling. &quot;What is happening now is so disappointing, because I&apos;ve really grown to like this place. It is somewhere that gives a lot of people a second chance, particularly mature students,&quot; he explains. &quot;It is a feisty, adaptable institution and lots of staff really want to believe in its future.&quot;",

    "text": "EA has announced through its Medal of Honor website that the next addition to the long-running shooter series will arrive this autumn, subtitled Warfighter. The February US edition of the Official Xbox Magazine apparently has all the exclusive details.  Right now, it seems the game will be developed entirely by Danger Close, previously known as EA LA, the studio responsible for the campaign mode in 2010&apos;s re-boot of the MoH series. The game will use the Frostbite 2.0 engine  the same tech as Battlefield 3.  Once again, it seems the story will involve so-called Tier 1 operators, elite soldiers working on special missions within enemy territory. As with the previous title, which was largely set in Afghanistan, it&apos;s likely the emphasis will be on real-world tactics and conflicts. This caused some controversy in 2010, when Labour MP Liam Fox complained about the appearance of Taliban fighters in Medal of Honor  however, his comments revealed only a passing knowledge of the game content, and the Labour party distanced itself from his statement. More details on the scenario of the latest title are expected to come to light at the GDC conference in two week&apos;s time. 2010&apos;s instalment of MoH was a critical and commercial success for EA, shifting around 5m copies, despite some criticism of the extremely short single-player mode. However, it failed to make much of a dent on Black Ops, which went on to record-breaking sales of more than 25m.  Rumours circulating at the moment suggest that Treyarch is also preparing a sequel to its own 2010 hit, Call of Duty: Black Ops. It seems the two brands will go head to head again in 2012.",

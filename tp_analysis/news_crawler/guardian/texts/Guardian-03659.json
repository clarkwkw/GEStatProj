    "text": "A little aristocrat and the woodman&apos;s friend flourished in last year&apos;s spring sunshine but butterflies are struggling to adapt quickly enough to our changing climate. The Duke of Burgundy, the second rarest butterfly in Britain, increased in number by 65% last year compared with 2010, and the endangered pearl-bordered fritillary  traditionally known as a friend of the woodcutter for its habit of colonising forest clearings  bounced back with a 103% increase. These spring species, that emerge in April, were joined by recording-breaking numbers of the unmistakable orange tip, which enjoyed its best year since the scientific monitoring of our butterflies began in 1976. Nineteen of Britain&apos;s 59 native species reached peak numbers earlier than ever before, with the majority of orange tips flying three weeks earlier than they did in 2010. But despite earlier emergences, the charity Butterfly Conservation said butterflies were being bamboozled by rapid climate change. Nearly three quarters of our species have declined over the last decade. Like most insects, butterflies are acutely susceptible to small changes in average temperatures and live in a &quot;climate space&quot;. The appropriate climate space for many species is moving north across Europe but a study published this year in Nature Climate Change showed that butterflies were not migrating north quickly enough to keep pace with it. Butterflies are lagging an average of 135km behind their natural climatic zone. &quot;Most species live in semi-natural habitats and fragmented landscapes and those species aren&apos;t able to move with the weather,&quot; said Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation, that monitors butterfly populations with the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology. The solution may be for conservationists to &quot;play God&quot; and give some southern species a helping hand by introducing them into northern areas of Britain where they have never occurred before. Mixed up seasons are disrupting butterflies&apos; life cycles and last year&apos;s midsummer species were wiped out when the hot spring gave way to the coldest summer for 18 years. Three species of our woodlands in July - the spectacular purple emperor (down 50% on 2010), the white admiral (down 51%) and the black hairstreak (down 65%) - all suffered. According to Brereton, spring species are well adapted to unpredictable weather  and can survive wet and cold spells like we are currently enduring  but climate change is causing summer butterflies to hatch out much earlier, and these die when temperatures drop. &quot;It&apos;s difficult if a species that normally flies in July and August comes out in May and then the weather changes  that disrupts it,&quot; he said. Once again this year, spring species have emerged earlier than ever, with grizzled skippers being recorded in March. But a good summer for butterflies will require a bit of rain as well as warmth and sunshine. &quot;Drought is terrible for butterflies,&quot; said Brereton. &quot;We don&apos;t want it too hot and dry because although we&apos;ll see plenty of butterflies on the wing the drought will kill the larval food plants and we won&apos;t see any butterflies next year.&quot;",

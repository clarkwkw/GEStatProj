    "text": "A conceptual follow-up to 2007&apos;s Warhawk, Starhawk places you on a futuristic frontier world in the midst of a sci-fi gold rush for Rift energy. Playing as Emmett Graves, a &quot;Rift salvager&quot;, the single-player campaign consists of defending claims with an assortment of weapons and vehicles, including powerful, transforming Hawk mechs. Starhawk blends third-person shooting with a simplified strategy element  gather Rift energy by killing mutants and you can have walls, bases, gun turrets and more deployed from orbit. Balancing the approaches simultaneously may sound tricky but both gameplay tactics work perfectly together. The real emphasis is on multiplayer, though, with a wealth of modes to explore. A twist on Capture the Flag works well with the build-and-defend elements intrinsic to the game, though the same properties cause team deathmatches to be drawn out. Overall though, it&apos;s a fantastic genre mash-up, and one of the best titles on PS3.",

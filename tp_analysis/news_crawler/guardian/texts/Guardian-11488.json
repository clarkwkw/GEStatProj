    "text": "If you ask me there&apos;s one TV Christmas special that never fails to hit the spot. Forget the Tardis visiting a frosty planet, tinsel-tinged arguments in Albert Square and Downton Abbey covered in snow. For me the real showstoppers are the Royal Institution&apos;s Christmas Lectures  they&apos;re as much a part of my holiday season as mince pies, a roast bird and twinkly lights. Better still, this year the Ri&apos;s serving of festive science is right up my street, with lectures on The Modern Alchemists or, more plainly, chemistry. Too often chemistry gets a bad rap. To some the word &quot;chemical&quot; is almost synonymous with &quot;poison&quot;. But everything we eat, drink, breathe, wear and touch is made of chemicals. So chemistry should be celebrated not vilified. And it&apos;s great to see the Ri doing just that. So in that vein, and since Christmas itself would be nothing without chemicals, I give you the chemistry of Christmas dinner. One of my favourite accompaniments to the Christmas feast (but maybe not everyone&apos;s) is red cabbage. Even if you can&apos;t stand to eat it you really should get one this year, because this particular brassica does something pretty cool. It&apos;s chock full of chemicals called anthocyanins (most red or purple fruit and veg, and poinsettias, contain them). The anthocyanins leach out of the cabbage when you cook it, turning the water purple. Before you chuck the cabbage water away pour some into two or three glasses. Then add a few drops of vinegar to one glass, bicarbonate of soda to the second and washing soda to the third. Low and behold, each glass now contains a different coloured liquid! It&apos;s all down to a property of anthocyanins that causes them to change colour in response to acids and alkalis. Next up, the candles on the centrepiece. You see a lovely decoration creating a warm glowing atmosphere. I see that too, but I also see chemistry and as a bonus a party trick for the dinner table. Candles are made from a mixture of chemicals called alkanes, which together form paraffin wax. When you light them you trigger an exothermic (heat-producing) chemical reaction between the wax and the oxygen in the air resulting in carbon dioxide and water.  Enough of the lesson, here&apos;s the trick. Blow out the candle and of course you&apos;ll see the smoke rising from the extinguished wick. But what you can&apos;t see is the paraffin vapour also rising from the hot pool of wax. That vapour is flammable, so try holding a match in the smoke an inch or so above the wick. Hey presto, the flame jumps down the vapour trail and the candle reignites! If you&apos;re reading on our mobile site, watch a demonstration here.            Don&apos;t put the candle away just yet, but do get yourself a thick-skinned orange and think of the tasty zest that turns up in so many Christmas recipes. Part of the peel&apos;s appeal comes from a chemical called limonene. It&apos;s this that generates that lovely smell you get when peeling the orange and it&apos;s the oily substance you see squirting out from the zest. It also happens to be highly flammable. So while you&apos;re munching on the fruit or making mincemeat try squeezing a bit of the limonene out of the orange peel and towards a candle flame (make sure there are no dangling decorations in the way). Get it right and you&apos;ll be treated to an impressive jet of flame.  If you&apos;re reading on our mobile site, watch a demo here.            Just when you think you can&apos;t eat another bite, out comes the flaming Christmas pudding. It looks so appetising, bathed in a blue glow as the brandy burns merrily away, but have you ever wondered why the pudding doesn&apos;t end up as a cinder from all that burning alcohol? Well, the brandy is about 60% water. So when you set it alight the energy from the burning alcohol gets absorbed by the water. The water then evaporates, which keeps the temperature of the pudding low (in the same way that sweat evaporating keeps you cool) and so stops the pudding getting scorched. And since the alcohol burns off well before all the water has evaporated, you are left with a slightly damp pudding. There you go, a little insight into the chemicals laid out before you on the 25th. When you tuck into them, don&apos;t forget to raise your silicon dioxide vessel, filled with your favourite mixture of ethanol, dihydrogen monoxide and assorted flavourings, and toast chemistry this Christmas.",

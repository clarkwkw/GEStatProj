    "text": "My friend and former colleague Maddalena Fagandini, who has died aged 83, was a pioneering television producer. In 1963 she got her big breakthrough on Parliamo Italiano, the first foreign-language teaching series on BBC television. This was the beginning of what became her life&apos;s work  producing a range of programmes teaching European languages without a single word, either spoken or written, in English. With the help, support and admiration of academics from Oxford and Cambridge universities, Maddalena devised new ways of teaching and learning foreign languages through &quot;kits&quot; combining broadcast programmes, audio tapes, discs and books. They continue to be used in schools and colleges. Her final language series, Deutsch Direkt, was made in the mid-1980s. Maddalena was born in Hendon, north London, to Italian parents, Ferruccio and Maria Fagandini. Her father had come to London from Italy before the first world war and in the early 1920s he met and married Maria, who had come independently to London via France. Music was in Maddalena&apos;s genes: her father, listed as a dressmaker in the London Gazette of 1925, was also a semi-professional singer performing in London clubs during the 1920s. Passionate about classical music and opera, Maddalena played her cherished baby grand rather well, but with some diffidence. Her career with the BBC began in 1953, when she joined the Italian section of the World Service at Bush House. Bilingual in Italian and English, she became a pivotal member of the television outside broadcast unit during the coverage of the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. That decade, she was in her element at the BBC radiophonic workshop, creating sound effects, composing theme music and jingles and experimenting with the electronic distortion of music. In 1976, she produced The Devil&apos;s Music. This took her and her director on an extensive filming trip in the US exploring the roots of blues music. They agreed that everyone in their series would be black, with no white experts &quot;explaining&quot; the music  a radical decision for the time. The book that accompanied the series is still in print 37 years later. Her final series on Mediterranean cookery (1987) is a fitting reminder to those of us who were fortunate enough to share her congenial table, where we listened, learned and laughed. She is survived by four nephews.",

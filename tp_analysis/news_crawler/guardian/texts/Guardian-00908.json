    "text": "A teenager has sent a mocking rejection letter to the University of Oxford after an interview for a place there. Elly Nowell, 19, who had been interviewed for a place to study jurisprudence at Magdalen College, turned down the university before it had offered her a place or rejected her. Nowell imitated the university&apos;s style of rejection letters by writing that she realised the admissions tutors &quot;may be disappointed by this decision, but you were in competition with many fantastic universities&quot;. She said the university &quot;did not quite meet the standard&quot;. Nowell, a student at Brockenhurst College, a further education college in Hampshire, said the grand, formal setting of the college &quot;allowed public school applicants to flourish  and intimidates state school applicants, distorting the academic potential of both&quot;. She told the BBC the interview had left her feeling like &quot;the only atheist in a gigantic monastery&quot;. &quot;I have now considered your establishment as a place to read law (jurisprudence). I very much regret to inform you that I will be withdrawing my application,&quot; the letter stated. She attacked the lack of diversity at the college. A spokeswoman from the university said the letter was &quot;a witty way to communicate her withdrawal&quot;. &quot;The irony is, though, that six out of the seven people offered law places at Magdalen were state-educated.&quot; It is not known whether the university intended to accept or reject Nowell. The teenager hopes to study at University College London.",

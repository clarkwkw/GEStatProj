    "text": "Peter Lampl says independent schools should &quot;open their doors to all young people based on ability rather than ability to pay&quot; (Letters, 15 June). But why should a child with a particular set of narrowly defined abilities at age 11 be given more opportunities than another? Lampl says &quot;[given] a clean slate, a truly comprehensive school system would be my starting point&quot;. So why not follow this logic and require schools in receipt of charitable status or state funding to admit a comprehensive intake? Many state schools already have a banding test to ensure that they have a good mix of all abilities, a system which does not disadvantage those who cannot afford expensive coaching.

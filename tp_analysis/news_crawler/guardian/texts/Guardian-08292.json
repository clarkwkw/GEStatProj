    "text": "While I&apos;m sure the majority of school students resist the conformist messages of uniforms (Suzanne Moore, 30 August), she is right and A Bentley (Letters, 4 September) wrong to insist thatsuch messagesdo not exist, at the level of taste as well as morals. The shirt, tie and blazer get-up represents not only a narrow view of work-appropriate dress (referred to as &quot;smart&quot;itis mostly simply drab) but an assault on aesthetic taste. Hideous colours left over from the 1940s (bottle green, maroon) vie with the ugly cut of clothing to deter the young from developing a sense of what suits them and how to dress attractively and appropriately.Why it should be considered a good idea for teenage girls to wear a tie (something worn in adult life only by lesbians, if indeed even by them these days) is completely beyond me. The over sexualisation of women&apos;s fashions and the influence of celebrity culture mentioned by your correspondent is certainly a problem, which did not exist even 15 years ago when my daughter attended a state co-educational comprehensive without a uniform; and certainly did not exist when I myself attended a well knownselective school at which we wore our own clothes.In any case, we both seem to have managed to develop some sense of discipline and orderliness without at a tender age having been forced to dress like a member of the armed forces.Professor Elizabeth WilsonLondon College of Fashion",

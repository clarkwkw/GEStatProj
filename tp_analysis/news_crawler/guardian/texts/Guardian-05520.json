    "text": "Gillett&apos;s lark, Mirafra gilletti, Sharpe, 1895, also known as Gillett&apos;s bushlark, photographed at Awash National Park, which has a southern boundary along the Awash River, located at the southern tip of the Afar Region in Ethiopia (Africa).

Nikon D300s, 600 mm lens, f/8, 1/800 sec, ISO 500     Question: This Ethiopian mystery bird is challenging to identify, at least partially because it resembles yesterday&apos;s mystery bird as well as several others. However, this taxon is very interesting because it gives scientists a snapshot of the speciation process as it occurs, which also makes this bird challenging to identify. What am I talking about? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult Gillett&apos;s lark, Mirafra gilletti, a member of the Alaudidae, or lark, family. All the larks occur in the Old World although one species, the horned lark, Eremophila alpestris (known as the shore lark in Europe), has successfully invaded North America, where I often saw it whilst birding semi-arid regions in the northwestern United States.  The larks are small to medium-sized passerines that are mostly drab, with brown or buffy plumage, usually with a long straight nail on the hallux (rear toe). Their bills are variable in shape and size. The larks are terrestrial birds that typically live in arid or semi-arid habitats.  Gillett&apos;s lark is a tawny bird. Its upperparts have pale brown streaks, its wings are paler than its mantle, and it has a rufous crown, a white supercilium and a dark brown stripe through its dark eye, and a horn-coloured bill. Its underparts are white or cream coloured with rufous streaks on the breast and pinkish brown legs and feet.  Gillett&apos;s lark occurs in Eastern Ethiopia and Somalia in sandy, rocky or grassy areas in dry savanna, woodland and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland between 1000-1500 m in elevation. They are terrestrial insectivores, feeding mainly on caterpillars and grasshoppers. My original question was badly worded, so it is leads you to an incorrect conclusion. My apologies. Here&apos;s an overview of the latest information about this bird&apos;s taxonomy. A number of authorities once thought Gillett&apos;s lark formed a superspecies with the Degodi lark, M. degodiensis, because these two taxa occur very close to each other -- within 50 km -- with no known overlaps in their ranges. For this reason, and due to the close resemblance between these taxa, Gillett&apos;s lark was viewed as providing a snapshot of the speciation process as it occurs. However, this is no longer thought to be the case. These two taxa are now probably the same species. [Also read this: Taxonomic status of the Degodi Lark Mirafra degodiensis, with notes on the voice of Gillett&apos;s Lark M. gilletti.].  Thanks to the good folks at Xeno-canto, here&apos;s an audio file of a singing Gillett&apos;s lark: However, there is still confusion based on the close physical resemblances between several other taxa. Some authorities also suspected that Gillett&apos;s lark forms a superspecies with the rusty bush lark, M. rufa, and the pink-breasted lark, M. poecilosterna, although current genetic evidence indicates that the pink-breasted lark should instead be shifted to the sister genus, Calendulauda. In short, these birds are confusingly similar unless you are carrying a PCR in your back pocket or you are very familiar with their voices.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

    "text": "On this week&apos;s edition of Science Weekly presented by Camila Ruz, we hear from the UK&apos;s leading conservationist Prof Kate Jones, joint chair of ecology and biodiversity at University College London and the Zoological Society of London. Kate discusses a recent TEDx conference in Washington on the power of genetic science to bring back extinct species.  The TEDxDeXtinction conference gathered leading scientists and experts, from geneticists and conservationists to ethicists and Hollywood producers, to debate the dawn of a new era in science that may allow us to bring back extinct species. Camila was joined by Observer science editor Robin McKie, who describes a breakthrough in the creation of synthetic vaccines by UK scientists this week. Finally, Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample met Anthony Challinor, Steven Gratton and Mark Ashdown, three of the Cambridge-based scientists behind the release this week of a map of the oldest light in the universe.

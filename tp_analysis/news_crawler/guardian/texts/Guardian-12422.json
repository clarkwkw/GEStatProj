    "text": "Releases this week include Wreck-It-Ralph (Wii, DS, 3DS), an appropriately retro if largely uninspired 2D platform game to complement Pixar&apos;s delightful plundering of video game history; Heavy Fire: Shattered Spear (Xbox 360, PS3, PC), which wants you to fire various calibres of weapon at absolutely everything that moves; Hitman HD Trilogy (Xbox 360, PS3) lets console owners finally find out what life was like before Hitman: Absolution while discovering what the fuss was about; Omerta: City Of Gangsters (Xbox 360, PC) makes managing a gangland empire about as entertaining as switching gas suppliers; while Wizardry Online (PC) sees the arrival of the powerfully hardcore Japanese massively multiplayer online game on our shores, with brutally hard difficulty level and permadeath intact. Fans of Dark Souls will be flaying themselves with birch twigs in anticipation.",

    "text": "Next week, thousands will travel to Doha, Qatar, for the next round of climate change talks at COP (Conference of the Parties) 18. It&apos;s a crucial time for climate change and development, coming only six months after the Rio+20 conference on sustainable development, and as discussions intensify around the post-2015 development agenda. The Kyoto protocol  the only global agreement on cutting greenhouse emissions  is set to expire at the end of this year. A recent report (pdf) commissioned by the World Bank examines the potential impact a 4C increase in global temperature could have on economic development. It outlines stark scenarios for developing countries: the inundation of coastal cities, risks for food production, which could potentially increase malnutrition, heatwaves, water scarcity and the loss of biodiversity. The responsibility for global climate change remains contentious. Brazil, South Africa, India and China, known as the &quot;Basic bloc&quot;, this week released a joint ministerial statement putting responsibility for success in &quot;the hands of rich nations&quot;, calling on them to commit to more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Helen Clark, head of the UN development programme, argues that &quot;climate change undermines gains in the developing world, threatening their lives, their livelihoods, and their countries&apos; prospects&quot;. She adds that the &quot;international community needs to make the transition to green and inclusive economies that tackle inequality, advance development and stop the ongoing assault on our ecosystem&quot;. What&apos;s at stake for developing countries at Doha? How should sustainable development be included in the post-2015 framework? What progress has been made to help countries adapt to climate change? On Tuesday 27 November we hosted a live chat to debate these questions and more. Follow the discussion in the comment thread below.  Panel  Helen Clark, head of the UN development programme (UNDP) and former prime minister of New Zealand. @HelenClarkUNDP   Alex Evans, senior fellow at New York University&apos;s Centre on International Co-operation and co-editor of the foreign policy website, Global Dashboard. @alexevansuk  Nazmul Chowdhury, manager of NGO Practical Action&apos;s Pathways from poverty project in Bangladesh, which works with communities on climate change adaptation  Michele de Nevers  senior program associate at the Center for Global Development, formerly senior manager at the World Bank environment department. @MicheledeNevers  Live chat best bits From HelenClarkUNDP:   The post-2015 global development agenda could set clear goals and targets for achieving sustainable development across its three strands  economic, social, and environmental. The MDGs do cover all three elements, but undoubtedly the environmental pillar could be strengthened in the post-2015 agenda  From alexevansuk:   No developing country is going to assent to goals on environmental limits without explicit assurances about fair shares to the environmental space within them; and nor should they. So the post-2015 framework also needs to be explicit about the need for an equitable approach   From NazmulChowdhury:  We need to include affected communities in drawing up the new sustainable development goals. And we need to see serious progress on adaptation at Doha. This means learning the lessons from communities and providing the finance for national adaptation plans  From micheledenevers:  There is an ambition gap. Many of the solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are known but expensive. For example reducing emissions from fossil fuels will require leaving many known fossil fuel resources in the ground rather than extracting them. But these fossil fuels are assets on the books of the big energy companies, and valued at trillions of dollars   From SteB1:   Local economies need to be made far more robust. They cannot rely on large-scale co-operation and big infrastructures to address these problems, simply because such large-scale co-operation will become ever more difficult as people attempt to preserve their prosperity  ",

    "text": "Since it made the leap in 2008 from developer to international publisher, Bethesda Softworks has cultivated an enviable reputation. After a growing-pains blip in 2009  when it published the rather substandard efforts Wet and Rogue Warrior  it has stuck to a policy of emphasising quality over quantity, reinforced by the acquisition of id Software, the legendary outfit which, through Wolfenstein 3D, invented the first-person shooter and brought us Doom and Quake. As ever, Bethesda didn&apos;t disappoint at E3, showing Dishonored  a definite game-of-the-show contender  Elder Scrolls Online and Dawnguard, a vampire-themed add-on for Skyrim. Dishonored     Dishonored    Dishonored has been seen at shows in the past, but at this year&apos;s E3 it looked strikingly coherent and polished  as you would expect it to, since it is scheduled for release on 12 October. The co-designers, Harvey Smith and Raphael Colantonio, talked us through a substantial live demo, with Colantonio explaining: &quot;We love first-person action games that mix story and stealth. We wanted playing Dishonored to feel like you&apos;ve designed your own experience. So you have supernatural powers that you can combine however you please, such as teleportation, possession and bending time.&quot; Smith and Colantonio proceeded to show precisely how you can take the approach of your choice, by running through the same mission twice in wildly varying manners. First time out, stealth was the watchword. The mission took place in the Golden Cat  essentially a high-class brothel  and involved assassinating the Pendleton twins, Custis and Morgan, who are corrupt MPs who own a slave-mine (their baroque names give a flavour of Dishonored&apos;s deliciously florid, Victoriana-meets-steampunk ambience). The first play-through was a stealthy one, bringing to mind the original Deus Ex (on which Smith worked). Smith and Colantonio were keen to point out that, rather than relying on scripting, the supernatural powers could be combined to unpredictable effect. We saw Corvo, the character you play, possessing a fish as a way to achieve stealthy entry via a drainage tunnel; Smith explained that you will only be able to possess humans when you acquire the highest level of the possession power. We also saw Corvo jumping from a great height but surviving, thanks to possessing a bystander below just before hitting the ground. The second play-through took more of a first-person shooter approach, with no concessions whatsoever to stealth. Even so, proceedings were far more imaginative than the average corridor-shooter: Corvo took people out with a crossbow, sticky grenades, a drop-assassination and even a plague of rats which left its victim&apos;s bones picked clean. Even with the weapons-based approach, at no point did we see a hail of bullets  ammo is clearly in short supply, so multiple enemies had to be taken out with a carefully assembled chain of attacks. Finally, another mission in which Corvo was pursued by Tallboys  spindly 20-foot-high mechs, each controlled by a human  showed off other areas of Dunwall, the whale oil-powered city, based on Victorian London, in which Dishonored takes place. Dunwall looks spectacular  its art-direction is clearly at least as good as that of the original BioShock. Clued-up, discerning gamers are already working themselves up into a state of excitement about Dishonored, and it made most people&apos;s lists of the best games on show at E3. The Elder Scrolls Online     Elder Scrolls Dawnguard    The prospect of an MMO set in the world of Tamriel  familiar to anyone who has played one of the five Elder Scrolls RPGs, which is an awful lot of gamers  is mouth-watering indeed. Unless, perhaps, you work for Blizzard  The Elder Scrolls Online clearly has ambitions to usurp World of Warcraft&apos;s crown. On the evidence of the game&apos;s first showing, it has a good chance of becoming the MMO of choice. After the Bethesda vice-president Pete Hines revealed the company has already been working on The Elder Scrolls Online for five years, Matt Firor, the head of Bethesda&apos;s sister company Zenimax Online, launched into a demo. He said: &quot;It&apos;s the perfect IP for an MMO  it has dungeons, combat and will provide the opportunity to meet people and help them. It has a real-time combat system and a quest system, so you can go through the world at your own pace. And there&apos;s a PvP system, which can support hundreds of players on-screen at the same time.&quot; Firor took us for a quick tour around the MMO version of Tamriel, and it looked pretty familiar. Not that the landscape was quite as lush and detailed as that of Skyrim, but that was only to be expected  MMOs have to take into account the demands of being played on PCs and Macs of varying specifications. But we saw a desert area and a jungle with Mayan-style architecture. He explained the basic plot: &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online is set in Tamriel 1,000 years before the events in Skyrim  right before the rise of Tiber Septim, the first emperor.&quot; The backstory dictates that three alliances have emerged  the Ebonheart Pact, the Aldmeri Dominion and the Daggerfall Covenant  and your choice of race will determine which of those you join (dark elves, for example, form part of the Ebonheart Pact). Firor hinted there will be political tensions between the alliances, adding: &quot;Cyrodiil is broken and destroyed  its history states that it made a pact to raise the undead to help defend against the other alliances, so there is also an undead threat, which is different in different systems.&quot; And the game has a common enemy: Molag Bal, the Daedric Prince, and his necromancer, Mannimarco. Dungeons An MMO wouldn&apos;t be worthy of the name without a healthy complement of dungeons, and The Elder Scrolls Online sounds well endowed in that area. Firor said: &quot;There are several different dungeon types. Including public ones  since dungeons are more challenging than most places above ground, they are good places for you to meet players in the game. You can go raiding, negotiating traps and puzzles.&quot; Combat Zenimax Online clearly hopes that one area in which The Elder Scrolls Online will have the edge over rival MMOs (even including recent efforts such as Star Wars: The Old Republic) is its combat system. Firor described it thus: &quot;We wanted to have an action-oriented combat system. Every character can block, sneak and sprint.&quot; What we saw looked  unsurprisingly  less responsive than Skyrim or Oblivion&apos;s combat systems, but similar in terms of the way it worked (with control over each of your character&apos;s hands, for example). Other elements of the game that Firor let slip include the presence of a crafting system, and the concept of ultimate skills  skills are familiar to Skyrim players, but it seems they will only be able to call on ultimate skills very occasionally. Bethesda said The Elder Scrolls Online will launch in 2013 (it refused to be more specific), for PC and Mac, and that it will be &quot;laptop-friendly&quot;. If it manages to capture the spirit of its offline siblings  which it should, since it takes place in familiar settings including Skyrim, Morrowind and Daggerfall  it could well enjoy full-blown &quot;gaming phenomenon&quot; status.",

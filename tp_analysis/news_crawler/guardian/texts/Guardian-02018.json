    "headline": "How to improve employability: Aston University's placements programme", 
    "text": "While young people with degrees remain far more likely to find a job than those without, soaring youth unemployment should serve as a wake-up call to universities and industry. As the Wilson Review into university-business collaboration highlights, the two sectors must work closer together to provide young people with the opportunities that will find them employment. This should start with universities making sure they are doing everything they can to help their students prepare for the workplace. The 2012 High Fliers survey of graduate recruiters suggested that one in three graduates will be recruited by a business or organisation they are already known by. In practice this means that they will have completed an internship or placement year. The sandwich degree, where a work placement is integrated into the course, and is structured and supervised, is proven to enhance employment prospects and even improve degree outcomes. But sadly, relatively few UK universities currently promote placement degrees. Aston has always done so, and the majority of students take a work placement or year abroad. This is why our employability ranking is so high. Placements don&apos;t just provide employment experience, they also help students develop their self confidence and ensure graduates are used to the disciplines of the jobs market  such as punctuality, organisational skills and meeting deadlines. Our ambition is to have all of our students undertaking a placement year by 2020. But the whole sector needs to take steps to maximise the employability of their graduates. Where possible, degree courses should be accredited by a professional body to give them extra weight and make it more meaningful to prospective employers. As Tim Wilson suggests, degree courses should be developed in partnership with business so that they equip students with job skills. This can also mean running entrepreneurship programmes led by entrepreneurs to inspire and encourage students to develop their own business ideas. Wilson&apos;s focus on employability skills is also welcome. Universities need to consider what more they can do, whether to integrate employability skills into degree courses from the first year. This should include formalising the preparation phase, with mock interviews and hands-on support with CV writing. There is also scope for business to take-on a greater mentoring role, so that students who join them are able to hit the ground running. And given that graduates are now competing for jobs in a global market, the ability to speak a foreign language is becoming increasingly desirable. Offering students free foreign language tuition should become the norm. Given the tough job market, current students should use the long vacations and use them to develop their skills and gain valuable work experience. And universities can work with industry to help this happen. Internships should be seen as a way of gaining valuable employability skills while still at university. The Aston Students&apos; Guild job shop provides reliable part-time and vacation work, with clear policies relating to term time working. These are paid vacancies with local employers, and they have all been vetted to ensure suitability, and they help students to build a CV that will help them to stand out in the crowd. Such support should also continue after students have graduated. With backing from the European Regional Development Fund, 10 west Midlands universities have come together to create Graduate Advantage. This is unique in the UK but could function as a prototype to be replicated across the country. Based at Aston, it is a one stop shop offering graduates the best local paid and voluntary internships, for up to a year. It has been created around the needs of small and medium sized businesses who have not historically participated in the &apos;milkround&apos; and did not fit into the university recruitment cycle. It was therefore difficult for them to know how best to access graduate talent. Such businesses, looking to recruit students, brief Graduate Advantage without having to pay any fee or subscription. They range across all sectors from IT to design. Graduate Advantage website has a search facility, where all internships are on display. More than 3,000 graduates have now been recruited through the programme. Furthermore, graduates who did not study in the West Midlands but have a home address in the region are also eligible to take part  making the placement and employability expertise we have developed available to a wider audience. After Wilson Review, the challenge now is to learn from what works and ensure all students are given opportunities to develop the skills they need to secure employment and compete in a global jobs market. This will help them succeed and benefit the economy.

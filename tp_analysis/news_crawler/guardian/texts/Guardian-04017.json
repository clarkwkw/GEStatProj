    "text": "1 Immediately present the target of your insult with asmall gift  If you are going to heap verbal scorn on someone, you ought to be ready to make amends immediately, because why should they be left feeling bad on the grounds of your hot temper? So, once you have done calling them a nasty name, present them with a small token of your apology. If you call them a berk or a dickwad, a cup cake should cover it, rising to abouquet or a gift voucher for aspa treatment if you use theC-word. 2 Learn a foreign language and insult them in that This is a win-win: you get the pleasure of learning a new language and, unless your insultee speaks, for example, Swedish, you can tell them they are a devilish pile of manure (Ditt jvla mg!) without fear of reprisal. Likewise, only a German person would be upset if you called them sitzpinkler  anyone else will have literally no idea that they have just been accused of always sitting down to urinate. Yeah, take THAT, sitzpinkler! 3 Offer a disclaimer Prefix every insult with the phrase: &quot;I am about to insult you, which says more about me than it does about you, and the fact that I have been reduced to insults first means you have effectively won this particular argument so you should not feel bad about what Iam going to call you.&quot; Self-explanatory, and to be honest, bythe time you have reached the end of the disclaimer, the target of your ire will probably have lost interest and drifted away. 4 Suffix every insult with the phrase &quot;hashtag onlykidding&quot; The perfect solution, as the instant anyone uses any phrase containing the word &quot;hashtag&quot;, you can immediately discredit them on the grounds that they are a cretin and their insults will fall to the ground and die like buckshot-riddled grouse and be reincarnated as a roundabout compliment. Note: you must be willing to make yourself look like a cretin for this to work. 5 Mime the insult  One way to take the sting out of withering opprobrium is to introduce an element of fun, and what could be more fun than a game of charades? However, bevery careful when miming phrases such as &quot;motherfucker&quot;, especially if you happen to be in the middle of a family dispute.",

    "text": "Girls are still much less likely than boys to do A-Level physics. Shame. It&apos;s a great subject that confers a wonderful understanding of how the world works. I think I&apos;d be a different, less logical person, without that training. I have to confess, though, that it was thrust upon me. At O-Grade, I wanted to do art, so I couldn&apos;t do chemistry. I wasn&apos;t doing chemistry, so I couldn&apos;t do biology. Physics I could do, because maths was compulsory  which I resented. Except that by &quot;doing&quot; physics, I learned maths wasn&apos;t abstract. From being a 14-year-old who didn&apos;t even want to understand maths, I became one who totally got it  that formulae were numerical expressions of patterns, beautiful in their perfect reliability. I still think that if maths was taught with physics from the start, the world would be better understood, and therefore simply better.",

    "text": "China&apos;s quest for natural resources has been the defining narrative of its development programme across Africa. But is that a true reflection of the country&apos;s intentions? Find out how Beijing has spent billions of dollars on development in our interactive, which uses research by AidData in the US.

What you said: some of the best reader comments We received some great recommendations for our new world library series. On Nigeria, AggieH mentioned books including Ike Oguine&apos;s A Squatter&apos;s Tale, which was described as:  A good story, nicely populated by imperfect and unreliable characters. It addresses universal themes  personal uncertainty, individual ambition, immigration &amp; emigration.  mayasethi said:  Half of a Yellow Sun was such a gripping and compelling book. [Chimamanda Ngozi] Adichie has got to be one of my favourite authors, her style of writing is gripping and she paints such a vivid picture of Nigeria.  On Colombia, Arven19 said:  I really enjoyed The Informers, The Secret History of Costaguana and The Sound of Things Falling by Juan Gabriel Vsquez. There&apos;s also The Armies by Evelio Rosero, which I think won a translation prize, and his most recent book Good Offices.

Kicking off the debate, Green, who has reservations about the process, argues that politics and the impact of any outcomes on national government policy need to be included in talks. Melamed, who is heavily involved in the post-2015 discussions, is yet to respond. And finally  Poverty matters will return in two weeks with another roundup of the latest news and comment.

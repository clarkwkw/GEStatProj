    "text": "The government has written to British universities urging them to do all they can to assist Syrian students, hundreds of whom are struggling to cope with reduced or even vanished funding amid the chaos in their home country. Vince Cable, the business secretary, whose department administers higher education, has written a joint letter with the universities minister, David Willetts, to Universities UK (UUK), requesting that its vice-chancellor members help Syrian students by deferring fees and providing access to hardship funds. The letter sent to Eric Thomas, vice-chancellor of Bristol university and UUK president, says the 670 or so Syrian students in Britain should be reassured that the government and universities &quot;are doing all they reasonably can to help them and make them aware of the support available&quot;. Cable and Willetts say the government is working with the higher education sector, the National Union of Students and Avaaz to identify who most needs help. Avaaz, the civic activism group that promotes &quot;people-powered politics&quot;, is calling for the Foreign Office to directly assist the Syrians in the way it did with Libyan students in 2011 during the uprising against Gaddafi. At that time the foreign secretary, William Hague, ensured funding was resumed via the National Transitional Council (NTC), the interim authority that replaced Gaddafi. An Avaaz online petition on the issue attracted nearly 50,000 signatures. The government argues that the situation with Syria is different, in that while it recognises the political opposition and has cut ties with the government of Bashar al-Assad, the rebels are not close to being a government in waiting, as was the case with the NTC. Additionally, only about 250 of the Syrian students in Britain were funded by the government, with the rest supporting themselves privately or by other means. The letter notes that the Treasury has set up a scheme for students to apply for a licence to have money sent to them from Syria, circumventing sanctions. Cable and Willetts write that they welcome measures already taken by many universities, for example, in stopping normal warning letters being sent when a fee deadline is missed and instead contacting Syrian students directly. The politicians say: &quot;Such early intervention has proven effective, and students themselves may not know what assistance is available to them. It is important each situation is considered on its merits to avoid the worst case scenario of expulsion or legal action as a result of a simple lack of knowledge of the specific student&apos;s situation.&quot; Their department is working with the FCO, Home Office and Treasury to see how else the students could be assisted, the letter adds. Students have already been given a grace period to extend or amend their visas without having to return home, and they will still be able to work and access healthcare, and can apply for asylum if needed. Alex Wilks, campaign director from Avaaz, said: &quot;This has been a crisis of complacency with some universities acting with compassion and others with court orders. This response from Cable and Willetts is helpful and shows the pressure of the campaign is working  UUK must act now on the laggards of Brunel, Salford, Bolton and Liverpool universities to step up and support their students.&quot;",

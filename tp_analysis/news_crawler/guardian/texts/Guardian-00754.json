    "text": "BioWare and LucasArts developed The Old Republic, their new massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, over a five-year period and it finally saw the light of day last month. But given that the real nature of any multiplayer online game is only revealed as its participants interact and shape their universe, allowing it a little time to see if it was worth the wait seems only fair. Eagerly awaited as The Old Republic was, MMOs rarely reveal their true nature on day one. TOR is subscription-based, takingplace in a continually expanding Star Wars universe, with seemingly infinite story content and engaging linear gameplay. It feels vast, a long-awaited rival to World of Warcraft  butwith even more detail and fresh, new environments  all of which adds up to some high-end system requirements. Once up and running, you&apos;ll be treated to the game&apos;s opening cinematic sequences, for my money featuring some of the most impressive lightsaber duels of any Star Wars title, both film trilogies included. At which point, and in the interest of full disclosure, I should reveal that my husband provided the voices for some of TOR&apos;s many characters  a fact that I have not allowed to colour my judgment. Gamers can choose to play for the Republic or the Empire and edit their character&apos;s visual appearance to taste. There is role play, for example as a Miraluka Jedi who has no eyes but can see by using the Force, or combat as a female Sith warrior with ice-cool diction. In-game conversations offer characters several options as replies, which can drastically affect the outcome of the story, and the consequences of which cannot be reversed. Combat may take a little time to grasp  although the self-resurrection process is pleasingly simple, and the fact that it takes a while to hone your skills means that there is an advantage in teaming up with other players when it comes to dispatching some of the tougher enemies. One month in, TOR is allying quality with quantity in a vast expanse of content backed up by immersive and enjoyable gameplay  and might even tempt staunch WoW devotees to the Dark Side.",

    "text": "London&apos;s City Hall is set to host a major exhibition of video game art. Running between 22 and 26 October, the free event will feature rare pieces donated by a huge range of publishers and developers: concept art, storyboards and digital images will all feature. The works will be auctioned off at the close of the exhibition, with the proceeds going to SpecialEffect, a charity specialising in making games accessible to people with disabilities.  Among the items on show will be game art produced by well-known developers such as Guerrilla Games (Killzone) and Media Molecule (LittleBigPlanet) as well as major publishers like Konami and Warner Bros.  The free exhibition will be part of the London Games Festival, a month-long celebration of game culture, which is being supported by The Guardian. &quot;The exhibition will be a stunning fusion of art and interactive entertainment, offering a very different view of an industry pioneered by this country,&quot; said event director Kirsty Payne. We will be hosting a series of events at the Guardian, including a workshop for prospective video game journalists and a Q&amp;A with the makers of the forthcoming stealth adventure, Dishonored. More details soon.",

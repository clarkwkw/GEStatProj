    "text": "England&apos;s public forests will be held in trust for future generations by a new and independent body, the government said on Thursday, after its embarrassing U-turn in 2011 on plans to sell off the nationally owned estate. &quot;I want to put the future of our public forests on a clear and firm footing,&quot; said the environment secretary, Owen Paterson. &quot;Our forests and woodland will remain secured in public ownership for the people who enjoy them, the businesses that depend on them and the wildlife that flourishes in them.&quot; The Forestry Commission, which currently manages the public forest estate, would be given extra funding of 3.5m this year to make up for not selling forestry land, he said. An additional 2m has been found from existing budgets to help the commission deal with ash dieback, a disease attacking the country&apos;s ash trees. The announcement confirming continued public ownership of the woodlands, made in response to recommendations from an independent panel, was broadly welcomed by conservation groups. But many criticised the lack of any timetable for setting up the new trust body and said the important work carried out by the Forestry Commission remained endangered by heavy budget cuts. Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, said: &quot;While these proposals are encouraging, they won&apos;t help if our woodlands are starved of funding and effective management in the long term.&quot; He said polling showed people valued wildlife most of all in woodland but that wildlife was declining at an alarming rate. &quot;We&apos;ve already lost three in four lesser spotted woodpeckers, nine in 10 willow tits and more than half of our woodland butterflies, and that&apos;s just a snapshot.&quot; Mary Creagh, shadow environment secretary, said ministers had cut Forestry Commission funding from 45m a year in 2010 to 33m in 2014. &quot;Ministers have quietly cut 500 [commission] staff, and a quarter of its budget. Handing our forests over to a trust is interesting but has no legislative timetable and no funding behind it.&quot; The chair of the commission, Sir Harry Studholme, said: &quot;I welcome how much the government has underlined the value of our natural resources. [But] this is only a chapter in a very long story.&quot; Paterson&apos;s predecessor, Caroline Spelman, sparked national fury over proposals to dispose of publicly owned woodlands to businesses, communities and charities. In response, Spelman apologised and set up an independent panel to examine the future of England&apos;s woodlands. This published a report in July urging the government to keep the forests in public ownership and pioneer a new approach to woodlands which valued and rewarded management, improvement and expansion of woods for all the benefits they provided to people&apos;s health, recreation, wildlife and a sustainable economy, potentially supporting 7,000 jobs. The panel&apos;s review said the public forest estate cost the taxpayer about 20m a year  around 90p per household in England  but paid back an estimated 400m in benefits to people, nature and the economy. The panel recommended that England&apos;s total wooded area should be expanded to 15% by 2060. However, the government, in its response , outlined ambitions to increase it from 10% now to just 12% in 2060. Paterson confirmed the sales of up to 15% a year of forestry land would be rescinded and sufficient funding would be provided so nationally owned woods could deliver benefits to people, wildlife and the economy. He said: &quot;A new, independent body will ensure our woods are held in trust and managed for the long term benefit of future generations, nature and the economy. Our woodland economy has the potential to create jobs and growth, and the action plan the forestry industry is establishing will set out a road map to achieve that.&quot; Paul Wilkinson, at the Wildlife Trusts, said: &quot;The public forest estate is exceptionally good value for money, especially when compared to the 85m cost of the controversial Bexhill-Hastings link road or the 33bn cost of HS2. Although it is good to hear some funding will be made available for certain initiatives, the entirety of the [Forestry Commission] will continue to need proper funding in the long term.&quot; Simon Pryor, at the National Trust, said: &quot;It is vital that the conservation work the Forestry Commission has done, restoring ancient woodland and providing woodland recreation, is sustained&quot; Benedict Southworth, chief executive at the walking charity Ramblers, said: &quot;Today&apos;s announcement means we can finally breathe a sigh of relief, safe in the knowledge that our public woodlands will not be sold.&quot;",

    "text": "Last week, I provided a list of forthcoming games events, taking in everything from big public exhibitions to intimate gatherings for developers and students of game design. I managed to miss a few key examples off the list, however, so here&apos;s a revised version. From the Eurogamer Expo to a Bafta discussion on games journalism, there&apos;s got to be something here that you really ought to go to. Have a look and get your diary ready! Games BritanniaWhen: 2-6 JulyWhere: Magna Science Adventure Centre, SheffieldWhat: An enormously ambitious event mostly aimed at schools, featuring hands-on workshops and lectures on game design from leading industry figures like Ian Livingstone. There is also a public exhibition entitled Replayed, which explores Britain&apos;s video game heritage and will include lots of classic games to rediscover. Tying in closely with the campaign to get computer science taught in schools, this should be a fascinating introduction to the games industry. Game Dev North: ReloadedWhen: 30 JuneWhere: Kash Bar, ChesterWhat: This is a really informal get-together for developers in the North West of England. It&apos;s billed as, &quot;A time to meet some new people, make some new connections, catch up with old ones and talk up your new project. Or show off your fancy business cards&quot;. Which sounds good to us. If you can&apos;t make it along this month, check the Twitter feed  @GameDevNorth  for info on subsequent events. RezzedWhen: 6-7 JulyWhere: Brighton CentreWhat: Organised by Eurogamer and Rock,Paper,Shotgun, this is a brand new event dedicated to PC and indie gaming. Over two days, it&apos;s set to offer gamers hands-on experiences with the likes of Borderlands 2, Far Cry 3, Aliens: Colonial Marines and Project Zomboid. There will also be gaming tournaments, and Valve is giving a Dota 2 beta key to every one of the 5000 expected attendees. Tickets are 12 a day or 20 for both days. Bafta Games Question TimeWhen: 2 JulyWhere: Pennine Theatre, SheffieldWhat: Okay, this is strictly part of Games Britannia, but it deserves its own entry. Starting at 8pm on Monday night, this is a chance for audience members to put their games industry questions to a panel of experts including Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil and UKIE chairman, Andy Payne. Tickets are free, but pre-booking is advised.  Develop conferenceWhen: 10-12 JulyWhere: Hilton Brighton MetropoleWhat: Britain&apos;s largest gathering of game developers continues into its seventh year with another impressive line-up of speakers including David Braben, Ian Livingstone and Dave Perry. It&apos;s mainly aimed at established development studios, hence the higher registration costs (685 for a three-day pass). However, the dedicated indie day provides lots of valuable discussions and talks for indie studios, and costs 95 for the whole day. There&apos;s also a free expo, where a selection of companies will be showing off their titles. Failing that, you can hang around in the Metropole bar and mingle with luminaries from throughout the Western games industry. If you stand still long enough, Mark Rein is almost certain to offer you a good deal on an Unreal Engine 4 license. Bafta Games Journalism PanelWhen: 16 July, 7pmWhere: Bafta, Piccadilly, LondonWhat: This promises to be a lively panel discussion about the state and role of games journalism in the modern industry. Are journalists too close to PR departments? How do you become a games writer? And what role does games journalism play in a rapidly changing entertainment sector? The panelists are great  Kieron Gillen, Naomi Alderman, Keza MacDonald, Rob Fahey and Helen Lewis. It&apos;s just a pity about the chair for the discussion. Yes, it&apos;s me. A limited number of tickets are free, the rest are 5. London Games FestivalWhen: 27 Sept - 28 OctWhere: various venues, LondonWhat: After a break last year, the London Games Festival is back, taking in a range of events around the capital. As usual, it encapsulates a series of self-contained treats including the excellent Eurogamer Expo (27-29 September, Earls Court), Future&apos;s Golden Joystick Awards (26 October) and the always fascinating MCM London Comic Con (26-28 October). more announcements are due to be made over the summer.  GameCity 7When: 20-27 OctoberWhere: various venues, Nottingham city centreWhat: The annual games event that I will go ahead and call &apos;utterly unmissable to anyone who has even glanced with ardour at a video game&apos; is now a week-long odyssey, taking in the usual selection of inspiring talks, indie game expos and amusing evening shenanigans. This year Peter Molyneux will be taking over for a whole day and you can expect lots of insight and indiscreet comments about working for Microsoft. Gamesblog will there too, albeit in a reduced capacity, hosting one of seven different mornings at the Broadway Cinema cafe. We might well find something else to do as well, if the organisers let us. Launch conferenceWhen: 13-14 NovemberWhere: Birmingham Science Park, AstonWhat: Aimed at developers, start-ups and students, this friendly and diverse conference is aimed at showcasing the most interesting work coming out of studios and academic institutes in the Midlands. There&apos;s a huge range of speakers including Rod Cousens (CEO of Codemasters and all-round industry veteran), Trevor Williams (co-founder of Playground Games, the developer of Forza Horizon) and Jo Twist (CEO of UK games industry trade body, UKIE), plus, I&apos;ll be there talking about games journalism! This is a really valuable event for wannabe developers in the region, with lots of access to movers and shakers in the region.",

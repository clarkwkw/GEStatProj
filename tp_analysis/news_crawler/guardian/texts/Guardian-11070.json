    "text": "If only my options in Tethys Petroleum were &quot;worth at least $400,000&quot; as you report (MP Peter Lilley has received more than $400,000 in oil company share options, 20 November)! Unfortunately your reporter seems unaware that the higher the price of an option, the less it is worth. The option to buy 100,000 shares at $1 is worth nothing if the shares are worth only 57p. In any case I do not understand your insinuation that my interest in Tethys Petroleum might influence how I perform my duties on the select committee monitoring the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Can you suggest any subject that the committee monitoring UK energy and climate policy has investigated, plans to investigate or might conceivably investigate that would in any way influence the profitability of a company whose operations are entirely in Central Asia? By contrast you apparently do not consider that those who have interests in UK windfarms or environmental consultancies are in any way conflicted in helping formulate or scrutinise UK energy and climate policy. Nor do I, because I believe in their integrity: they will put the national interest before any personal financial interest  as would I if I had such a conflict, which I do not.Peter Lilley MPConservative, Hitchin and Harpenden",

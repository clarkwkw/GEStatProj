    "text": "Luck, long walks and his mother&apos;s illegal beer-brewing business all helped Aggrey Otieno to avoid a life of crime and drugs, and led him to become one of Kenya&apos;s leading social activists. The boy born in Korogocho slum in Nairobi  the fourth-largest in the city  says he avoided getting into trouble in the community of 250,000 people because he used to get up at 3am to help his mother make beer. After that, he would walk 34km (21 miles) a day to and from secondary school. &quot;She got arrested many times,&quot; he says. &quot;But Nairobi has a lot of corruption and she paid off the police and never went to prison. That was in the 1980s and 1990s. It was survival.&quot; The beer paid for his schooling, but Otieno&apos;s own talents took him to university and then to Ohio in the US, where he got a masters in communications and development and a diploma in African community health  the first degree awarded to anyone from Korogocho. He could have walked into almost any job in Nairobi but he chose to return to Korogocho to improve life in the slum, setting up the grassroots non-profit organisation Pambazuko Mashinani, which works on civic health education. The team of 80 that he leads disseminates information about illnesses such as tuberculosis and Aids but, in a stroke of genius, Otieno got the criminals of Korogocho to play football. Korogocho United now tops division three of the Kenyan league and is set to be promoted next year. One condition of playing is that they must offer security to pregnant women in the slum. &quot;As a result of the football, their energy is now focused on playing soccer and by the time they are done with their matches or training they are usually too tired to steal from anyone. People are so happy that we have one person in Korogocho who is not a criminal,&quot; he says. &quot;I am a slum boy. I was born in Korogocho. It is my home. I have gone through what they have going through,&quot; he added, after winning a $100,000 Rolex enterprise award at an event in Delhi. Pambazuko will soon expand. After his only sister nearly died in labour at home, Otieno says he began to understand the problems facing women who had no childbirth education or medical facilities. In three months&apos; time, his new 24-hour telemedecine centre will begin working to save the lives of around 300 Korogocho women and 200 newborn babies who die each year because of the lack of medical facilities. In Korogocho, the maternal mortality rate is around 700 women out of 100,000 compared with 13/100,000 in the EU and elsewhere in Europe. But real change in the slums will not come from Kenyan politicians, he says. &quot;They come telling people they will do this or that. But they are different. Only when people are empowered to act for themselves can they start influencing events. When it&apos;s top down, you do not know your rights. &quot;I have come under pressure to go into politics, but I prefer to work with people in Korogocho. When I look back, I realise it was chance that I did not become a criminal or a drug addict. Education is the key to change.&quot;",

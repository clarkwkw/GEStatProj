    "text": "Outlaw racer Need for Speed is in many ways a series based on a very American love of cars  centred on noise, velocity and an almost sexual attraction to the growling muscle under the hood. A spot of irony here then, in that production of the titles has recently been moved to speed-hungry Guildford, and the offices of Criterion Games. But it was an appropriate move. Criterion is famous for making Burnout, the beautifully destructive series that culminated in the open-world ambition of Burnout Paradise, so it makes sense that Most Wanted feels as much like a follow-up to that game as it does a traditional Need for Speed title. More so, in fact  Criterion&apos;s latest might have the licensed manufacturers and street-racing cool that have always been Need for Speed&apos;s hallmarks, but underneath the hood it&apos;s pure Burnout. It&apos;s there in the explorable city of jumps and unexpected platforms, of smashable gates and billboards. It&apos;s there in the glorious, physics-defying back-end drifts and side-swiping takedowns (Criterion still has a cinematographer&apos;s eye for sleek cars, and even more so for their slow-motion disintegration). And above all else, it&apos;s there in the always-connected multiplayer, which turns the city into a playground for leaping, crashing toy-car larks, and every speed camera and jump into a high-score table. Fast and furiously compelling.",

    "text": "Earlier this month, the UN announced that the famine in Somalia was officially over, thanks to a good harvest, heavy rains and a swift response to the crisis from donors. However, the UN also warned that more than 2 million people were still at risk of malnutrition and food insecurity and would need ongoing support to prevent a return to famine conditions. Somalia&apos;s future is to be discussed at a high-level international conference in London next week, expected to be attended by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Civil society and diaspora groups have not been invited to the table, but local NGOs are due to hold their own event on Monday to discuss their country&apos;s future. Ahead of both events, we will be speaking to a panel of representatives from the Somali diaspora to gauge their views and ideas, and we&apos;d like to hear from you. Post your questions on our talk point and we&apos;ll put some of them to the panel. We&apos;ll report back with their answers on the site next week. Elsewhere on the site We reported on the postponement of the UK government&apos;s election promise to enshrine in law the commitment to give 0.7% of national income in foreign aid. Following news that the commodities trader Glencore received 50m from the World Food Programme from the sale of wheat, Felicity Lawrence discussed whether, in the absence of enough available local stock to fill the need, the WFP had much choice on where it sourced food. Annie Kelly explored what the second decade holds for the Global Fund for Aids, TB and Malaria, suggesting that it needs to make changes to regain lost momentum. Claire Provost reported on changes to the USAid procurement regulations, which mean firms in developing countries can now bid for contracts with the US international aid agency. And Mark Tran reports on schemes to help poor communities in Bangladesh. Community photo project Got a development story to tell this year? Is something in your life, work or local neighbourhood expected to change over the coming months? We want you to get involved with our 2012 community photo project to document a slice of your life. More details are on our Talk point and Flickr group. Coming up on the site On Wednesday, we&apos;ll report on research by the NGO Save the Children on the long-term effects of hunger on young people. We also highlight the impact of malnutrition on children in Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A month after Nigerians ended their protests against a 120% rise in the price of petrol, we speak to Lagos residents about the future of the country, and whether they feel confident president Goodluck Jonathan&apos;s government can deliver on development and good governance. Mark Tran reports on climate adaptation in Bangladesh. And look out for our next Global development podcast, which this month explores the progress and future of the fair trade movement.

In pictures: Solar power arrives in the Puno region of Peru Euro-Solar, together with local partners, has installed solar panels in 600 villages in the eight poorest countries of Latin America, as part of a 36m euros ($47.6m) EU-funded project. The isolated village of Pasiri and the Uros people of Lake Titicaca, in southern Peru, are two of the communities to have benefited. What you said: some of the best comments from our readers Last week we published a blogpost that discussed whether encouraging young women to delay childbirth can improve their economic prospects. The post provoked some strong reactions. We will be coming back to the issues of gender and development over the coming weeks, but in the meantime, here is a selection of your comments from the post. ameliesgnome wrote:  Its [sic] not just about reducing pregnancy rates. It&apos;s about how the society views women, and their place within it. Giving women back their reproductive systems is just one part of that.  BladeAbroad commented:  Isn&apos;t this whole &quot;girl effect&quot; being misread? Isn&apos;t it rather a reflection of the society in question and openness of mind and shared responsibility rather than simply a matter of &quot;Here you go. Here&apos;s some money and change in regulations. Now go change society&quot;? It&apos;s not just the lives of girls and women in some societies that you&apos;d need to change but the minds of boys and men.   Chewtoy said:  Of course there&apos;s nothing wrong with campaigns to educate poor women, a worthy cause in and of itself. But if the &quot;girl effect&quot; is seen as a one-size-fits-all magic solution to poverty, ignoring the many differences between the various local conditions in developing countries (cultural, economic and otherwise) then I&apos;m afraid it is destined to fail.   And Branfish added:  Good article, but I think you may have slightly missed the point. Yes, educating more girls has sometimes been sold as a means to delay parenthood, but I&apos;ve more often heard it explained that it&apos;s because if you invest in girls&apos; education, you&apos;re educating their (future) families, whereas if you invest in boys&apos; education, you&apos;re only educating that boy.   Highlights from the blogosphere The &quot;results agenda&quot; has been much discussed, but, as Owen Barder discovered, it can mean different things to different people. He dissects some of the debate. The World Bank&apos;s Vijay Pillai looks at two signifcant reforms in Sierra Leone  in the energy and telecoms and ICT sectors  that have the potential to yield economic gains in the long term. Following the opening of Somaliland&apos;s first central bank, Vijaya Ramachandran, from the Centre for Global Development, asks how international donors can further support business in the country, and what can be learned from how the bank does business. And finally  The Poverty matters newsletter will be back in two weeks with another round-up of the latest news and comment. In the meantime, keep up to date with the issues on the Global development website.

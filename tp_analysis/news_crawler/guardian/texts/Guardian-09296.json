    "text": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Raspberry Pi: RS Components struggling to ship orders from June &gt;&gt; IBTimes UK  Customers put their names down on the order lists months ago, and some of them are still waiting for their orders from RS Components. And it seems they may have to wait until November, possibly, for orders placed in July.   The supply chain challenge laid out. Indian Railways - Live! &gt;&gt; Google Maps Yes: all India&apos;s trains in real time depicted on maps. Remember when this was done for London&apos;s tube trains? An announcement about Gawker links in /r/politics &gt;&gt; Reddit politics  As some of you may know, a prominent member of Reddit&apos;s community, Violentacrez, deleted his account recently. This was as a result of a &apos;journalist&apos; seeking out his personal information and threatening to publish it, which would have a significant impact on his life. You can read more about it here  As moderators, we feel that this type of behavior is completely intolerable. We volunteer our time on Reddit to make it a better place for the users, and should not be harassed and threatened for that. We should all be afraid of the threat of having our personal information investigated and spread around the internet if someone disagrees with you. Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them. As a result, the moderators of /r/politics have chosen to disallow links from the Gawker network until action is taken to correct this serious lack of ethics and integrity.   Or &quot;Reddit discovers censorship&quot;, as it&apos;s being described elsewhere. Trolls filed 40% of patent infringement lawsuits in 2011 &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  A new study helps to fill the gap by providing systematic data on the growth of patent troll litigation. Robin Feldman, a professor at UC Hastings College of Law, teamed up with Lex Machina, a Stanford Law spinoff that collects data on patent litigation, to compile a systematic survey of patent litigation. Their results are striking: the fraction of lawsuits filed by troll-like entities grew from 22 percent in 2007 to 40 percent in 2011.  Nokia &apos;on a roll&apos; with maps after Apple woes &gt;&gt; Sydney Morning Herald  Nokia is betting that the critique Apple has received will highlight the advantage it has gained through years of investing in its maps, said Michael Halbherr, head of Nokia&apos;s location and commerce unit.  &quot;What I love and what I think has happened is that the discussion has moved to quality and moved away from &apos;I have a map app you have a map app,&apos;&quot; Halbherr said over coffee at his division&apos;s office in Berlin last week. &quot;People start looking at how precise it is.&quot;   Given the EUR8bn cost of Navteq (what is now Nokia&apos;s location and commerce unit) and that it has kept losing money, you can be sure Nokia is happy now. Google gives Street View a 250K-mile update across 17+ countries, its biggest update ever; Maps API now features time zones &gt;&gt;TechCrunch  The Street View update today, according to Ulf Spitzer, Street View Program Manager, will increase Street View coverage in Macau, Singapore, Sweden, the U.S., Thailand, Taiwan, Italy, Great Britain, Denmark, Norway and Canada. (The image here is of the Taroko Gorge in the Taroko National Park. Something that would not have been included in Google&apos;s previous coverage of Taiwan now can be toured as if you are driving through it.)  It will also see Google creating &quot;special collections&quot; -- essentially lovely, highly visual features -- in six main countries, South Africa, Japan, Spain, France, Brazil and Mexico, along with smaller collection updates in other countries. Armchair travellers, rejoice!   Wonder when Nokia will start looking to get Navteq and its street view systems onto other platforms. Might it be on BB10? (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.) No Filter: Inside Hipstamatic&apos;s lost year searching for the next killer social app &gt;&gt; Fast Company  Hipstamatic&apos;s journey over the past year has been tumultuous, to say the least. As Fast Company has learned from speaking to more than a dozen players involved, Hipstamatic has wrestled with ever-growing social competition, internal tensions, and a lack of product vision--not to mention juggling acquisition interest and worsening term sheets in a post-Facebook IPO world.  But what the startup has most struggled with is remaining relevant in an unforgiving app market dominated by one of the hottest spaces in tech: photos.   They thought Instagram wasn&apos;t interesting because it was built around &quot;social&quot;, launched a terrible limited-pictures product, and turned down overtures from Twitter. Apart from that though..  Counterfeit power supply units in the UK &gt;&gt; Raspberry Pi  We&apos;ve found that there are three specific, different kinds of fake Apple charger popping up and causing trouble in the UK. We know that Trading Standards are already aware of these fake PSUs; apparently raids on suppliers have been carried out, but there are still plenty of them out there. Here&apos;s some video which should help you check that yours is the real thing. If you find that your charger is a fake, take it back to the seller and raise a stink: and most importantly, stop using it immediately. You could damage your Pi or yourself (and anything else you plug into the PSU).   (Thanks @rubbernuke for the link.) HTC tablets fade from US market, but firm keeps options open &gt;&gt; FierceWireless  However, [HTC global communications manager Jeff Gordon] acknowledged that Apple&apos;s iPad continues to dominate the tablet market and he said that HTC would only consider returning to the tablet space if it developed a product that could make inroads against the iPad and other tablets.  Gordon said it&apos;s unclear what strategy HTC might take in a possible return to tablets. He said the company could try to tackle the lower-end of the market, as Google has attempted with the Wi-Fi-only Nexus 7, or it could build a more powerful device that would cost more.  &quot;We&apos;re very much not set on one strategy over another,&quot; he said. HTC&apos;s previous tablet entries have spanned the gamut: The company&apos;s Jetstream launched at $700 and its W-Fi-only Flyer device sold for $299 through Best Buy.

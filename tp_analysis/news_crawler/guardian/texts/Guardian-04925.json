    "text": "A report produced by the Higher Education Academy in 2009,Developing undergraduate research and inquiry, argued that &quot;all undergraduate students in all higher education institutions should experience learning through, and about, research and inquiry.&quot; Referencing what the report calls the &quot;undergraduate research movement&quot; in the United States, its authors, Mick Healey and Alan Jenkins, call for a &quot;research-active curriculum&quot;, stating that: &quot;such curricular experience should and can be mainstreamed for all or many students, and achieved through structured interventions at course team, departmental, institutional and national levels.&quot;  Fast forward two years and the call for undergraduates to engage in research has intensified, in part due to the need for universities to win students in a more competitive marketplace. Involving undergraduate students in research, adds value to the student experience and helps the institution stand out from the crowd. So, for those universities interested in exploring this option, just how do they go about developing undergraduate research programmes, and ensuring they are a success? On Friday 13 January, we bring together a panel from across HE to look at this growing trend, the range of engagement activities available, what makes for successful projects and lastly, explore the ways to ensure both academics and students can gain from the experience.

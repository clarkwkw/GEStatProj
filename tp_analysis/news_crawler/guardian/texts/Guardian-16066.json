    "text": "One of my friends, who, though busily bird-nesting, is not taking eggs but marking the young, witnessed a bad case of collector&apos;s depravity  the robbery of a merlin&apos;s nest and slaughter of the female bird. I quote his remarks, slightly qualifying his justifiably forcible expression. &quot;To an outdoor naturalist it is horrible to see the wanton destruction wrought by these unscrupulous collectors  miscalled naturalists. For the egotistical satisfaction of possessing specimens this creature hired three men with guns, who secured the female but, thanks to me, lost the male.&quot; &quot;E.S.&quot; sends a picture and record of his cousin&apos;s pigeon, &quot;Mirande cock,&quot; which has crossed the Channel fourteen times and &quot;flown over 10,600 miles in races alone, an average of 1,500 miles per year.&quot; &quot;F.J.C.&quot; sends a sheep tick which he found attached to his leg after a walk in Eskdale. It had evidently been waiting on the grass for some passing food-supply, for its blood-reservoir was practically empty.  &quot;G.P.&quot; - The plant gathered on Cobden Edge is the milkwort. Its flowers and leaves vary considerably in colour, size, and shape.  &quot;E.M.&quot; - Clarence Elliott&apos;s edition of John&apos;s &quot;Flowers of the Field&quot; (published by Routledge) will, I think, supply the want. It has nearly 300 coloured plates and many useful text figures.    ",

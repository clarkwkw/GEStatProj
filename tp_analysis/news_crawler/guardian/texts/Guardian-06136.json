    "text": "Two Conservative cabinet members have asked the prime minister to tackle the lack of growth and jobs creation, and to do more to boost investment in low-carbon energy and other green infrastructure. The intervention by development secretary Andrew Mitchell and environment secretary Caroline Spelman follows a move by the foreign secretary, William Hague, who in March urged David Cameron to do more to help green industries boost the economy, stop the UK falling behind its rivals, and avoid losing its global leadership on the environment. The government is coming under growing pressure, including from some of its own backbenchers, to do more to generate growth and jobs and improve competitiveness after the UK returned into recession earlier this year, and ministers are bracing themselves for another set of bad economic news for the current quarter next month. The arguments put forward by the Tory cabinet members reflect a growing divide in the Tory party between a vocal group of MPs who believe that a large increase in low-carbon energy and other infrastructure will push up prices and damage the UK economy, and those who believe that more &quot;green&quot; investment will create jobs and reduce costs in the long term by protecting the UK from rising oil prices and dependence on foreign powers for energy. A group of backbenchers has secured a debate in the House of Commons on Thursday 28 June on &quot;fiscal measures to promote the green economic sector&quot;, which they hope will enable supporters to challenge opponents in their own party before crucial decisions are made about energy policy. Tory modernisers are also worried that Cameron&apos;s failure to follow up on his declaration that climate change was the greatest challenge facing mankind and that he would lead &quot;the greenest government ever&quot; is one of the issues helping &quot;retoxify&quot; the party&apos;s brand  something that Tim Montgomerie, the rightwing moderniser and editor of the influential Conservative Home website, has warned about. In Mitchell&apos;s letter, seen by the Guardian, he &quot;endorsed&quot; the four key arguments for green growth put forward by Hague: improved productivity, an opportunity to export new technologies, protecting UK businesses from price shocks from oil and other declining commodities, and creating jobs. UK research and investment in such industries could also help spread them to help low- and middle-income countries, and would help UK &quot;soft power&quot;, Mitchell said. Thursday&apos;s backbench debate will be introduced by Laura Sandys, who had support from 25 Conservative colleagues and three other MPs. Sandys has a history of campaigning on environment issues, including climate change, and persuaded MPs such as Conservative eco-campaigner Zac Goldsmith and Green party MP Caroline Lucas to sign the motion. However, the South Thanet MP, who represents some of the most deprived wards in the country, said she wants the debate to be on economic issues, and eight of the signatories on the motion are among the 100 Tory MPs who earlier this year signed an open letter urging the PM to stop supporting onshore windfarms, something that should help separate opposition to wind power on planning grounds from wider support for (or opposition to) clean energy and the green agenda. &quot;What we&apos;re looking at is energy resilience and re-engineering our economy to be less dependent on expensive imports; it&apos;s not green, it&apos;s good business,&quot; she said. &quot;In a strange way, the green aspect creates an ideology rather than a pragmatic business rationale.&quot; The latest interventions have come to light after the government&apos;s recently departed climate change envoy, John Ashton, warned MPs that failure to take more action to invest in a low-carbon economy was a threat to the future &quot;prosperity and security&quot; of the British people because of the risks to food, water and energy. &quot;Internationally we must resolve the false choice, exacerbated by the current crisis, between economic security and climate security,&quot; Ashton told the energy and climate change select committee. &quot;A rapid shift to low-carbon growth is essential for security, competitiveness and prosperity, not an intolerable risk to competitiveness, jobs and growth. Politically we must address this not as a distraction from our current problems, but as part of the solution to them.&quot; However, committee member Dr Phillip Lee said there were still hundreds of millions of people who wanted a better standard of living in developing countries such as China, and in the UK during the recession, who would not support policies that pushed up the price of energy and thus of the goods and services they wanted to buy. &quot;It&apos;s seen that going green is going to slow down the growth that we need,&quot; said Lee.",

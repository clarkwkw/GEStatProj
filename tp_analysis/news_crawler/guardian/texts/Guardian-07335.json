Read Apps Blog&apos;s interview for more details on Smule&apos;s plans.

Meta It&apos;s late to be getting into competition with Instagram, given its 80m+ users. Still, Meta is intriguing: a photography app that places great emphasis on the &quot;handcrafted&quot; nature of its filters. Plus it works with Instagram, Facebook and Twitter anyway. TuneWiki Music-playing app TuneWiki has been available for years, but a brand new version - as in not just an update - was released this week. It still enables you to play music from your iPhone with scrolling lyrics, but social features are now a bigger part of the mix. Little White Lies Stella Artois and Little White Lies magazine have teamed up for a film-focused app in the UK. Users can read reviews, find out where films are screening near them, and get details on Stella&apos;s own film-related events. Bloc Party As British band Bloc Party prepare to release their Four album, they&apos;ve launched an official app. The usual news, music clips, videos and social features are included, but more eye-catching is a weather &quot;fourcast&quot; that checks your location, then delivers a video weather forecast from the band members themselves. That&apos;s this week&apos;s selection, but what have you been using on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch? Make your recommendations in the comments.",

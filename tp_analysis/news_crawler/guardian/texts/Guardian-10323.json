You&apos;d probably laugh: surely people renowned for their smarts, who can solve the mysteries of the universe and find cures for deadly diseases, couldn&apos;t possibly be so stupid.  Unfortunately, this is no parallel universe. We scientists are not stupid, but we&apos;ve somehow ended up drinking the Kool-Aid. Modern academic science is comprised of jobbing scientists, collectively vying for a tiny number of positions and competing for an ever-dwindling pot of money to fuel their experiments. Success on both the job and grant front is dependent on one main metric: the value of one&apos;s research. Albert Einstein once said, &quot;Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.&quot; But what if the only easy and universally acceptable way to measure value is success? And what if that &quot;success&quot; is assessed using a system known to be deeply flawed? Nowadays, scientists are judged almost solely on the papers they produce. This focus on papers is already misleading, since people can contribute to science in many other ways. But even so, it wouldn&apos;t be quite so bad if the paper judgement were at least fair.  Unfortunately, it usually isn&apos;t. The current system typically involves giving a paper a number based on the success rate of the journal in which it&apos;s published  the so-called impact factor, which is a metric administered by one commercial company, Thomson Reuters. &quot;Success&quot; in this case is measured by the average number of times papers in that journal are cited. Many people have pointed out why journal-level metrics like this are wholly inappropriate for assessing individuals  if you&apos;re unfamiliar with the history and arguments, a rousing piece by my fellow Occam&apos;s blogger Stephen Curry is a great place to start.  Just to illustrate the point, I have a paper in the Journal of Virology which has been cited 90 times, and a paper in Oncogene, published around the same time, cited 55 times. Yet the impact factor of Oncogene is higher than that of the Journal of Virology  so clearly impact factor can be misleading. (The &quot;number-of-times cited&quot; metric also has flaws, by the way, but at least it&apos;s based on my work, not on the average quality of a group of other random people whose papers happened to appear in the same journal.) How much damage can one misplaced little number do? Impact factors are still widely used to choose whom to shortlist, hire and promote, and on whom to bestow grant money.  But the stakes are higher still. In 2014, the entirety of UK higher education will be evaluated by a process called the Research Excellence Framework (REF), in which individual universities are assessed by the quality of &quot;outputs&quot; of the researchers they employ. The results of this survey will decide how to apportion money to each institute: the better your researchers appear, the more money you get. The exercise is so Herculean that preparations began two years in advance.  Clearly aware of the growing backlash against impact factors, the REF14 committee made a huge deal of the fact that (a) an individual&apos;s worth should be measured by more than just their paper output, but (b) when you do evaluate someone&apos;s papers, you must not use impact factor or journal ratings  you must assess the impact and quality of the actual research. Here&apos;s the official policy (third to last FAQ):  No sub-panel will make any use of journal impact factors, rankings, lists or the perceived standing of publishers in assessing the quality of research outputs. An underpinning principle of the REF is that all types of research and all forms of research outputs across all disciplines shall be assessed on a fair and equal basis.  Sounds positively enlightened, doesn&apos;t it? Unfortunately, it seems that the mandate is being widely ignored by some universities. Not necessarily at the very top, but by the people who have been deputised to decide the importance of individual researchers&apos; papers. I have seen evidence at my own university, and heard many stories from colleagues at other universities across the UK.  Lists of publications are being drawn up, and papers are being sorted into piles based solely on the titles of the journals in which they&apos;ve appeared. For people who work in important niche areas where the best route of dissemination is through uncelebrated specialist journals, such a practice will hit disproportionately hard.  The most astounding thing, to me, is that people in charge of the bean-counting at some universities aren&apos;t even hiding the fact that they are breaking the rules  they feel comfortable enough to state in an email (I&apos;ve been shown several) that they are using simple journal rankings  as if they are unaware of the zero-tolerance policy against such practices.  Unaware, or perhaps just confident that they won&apos;t be punished, because everyone else is doing it too. A poor report of REF output can have consequences for one&apos;s career. I know someone whose papers have been under-ranked by a bean-counter who is completely unfamiliar with her field and with her prominent standing in it, and who is currently being overlooked for a promotion as a result. She is currently trying to get her papers independently assessed by an expert in the US, but it&apos;s by no means certain that her appeal will be heard.  Despite the consequences of a badly handled REF assessment, some individuals feel they cannot complain or blow the whistle for fear of career-damaging reprisals. As a result, hard evidence of journal ranking abuse in the REF is difficult to quantify.  As a very crude first step, I thought an anonymous poll, naming no names or institutions, might shed light on whether the experiences of colleagues I know are reflected more widely. I&apos;d like to ask any person in a university who has experienced REF paper assessments to take part. It&apos;s not scientific, but it&apos;s a start.  How bad it is? And if it&apos;s as bad as I suspect, what can be done? Click here to take part in the poll",

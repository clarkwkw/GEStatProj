    "headline": "Cull could wipe out badgers in some areas", 
    "text": "The government&apos;s plan to cull badgers could wipe out up to 79% of the animals in their heartland of the west and south-west of England, according to documents seen by the Observer, and up to almost a third of the national population. Local extinctions &quot;cannot be ruled out&quot;, warned Natural England, the government&apos;s statutory wildlife advisers. Officials also told ministers that there was a &quot;significant risk&quot; that the culls would break European wildlife protection law. The shooting of up to 130,000 badgers is intended to curb tuberculosis infections in cattle, which led to the slaughter of 25,000 cattle in 2010 and cost taxpayers 90m. But Natural England told ministers: &quot;We have a low level of confidence that the predicted benefits [of the cull] can be delivered consistently.&quot; Officials wrote: &quot;Reducing the badger population on the scale permitted under this policy has not previously been sanctioned for any protected native mammal species in modern times.&quot; The highly controversial plans are already under legal attack from the Badger Trust through the high court, but the environment secretary Caroline Spelman and farmers have defended them as necessary to tackle bovine TB, which has been increasing rapidly. Opponents argue that better security on farms and vaccination are a more effective and less costly solution to the problem. The newly revealed documents constitute official advice given by Natural England to Spelman and released, with redactions, under freedom of information rules to Labour&apos;s shadow environment secretary, Mary Creagh. She said: &quot;Ministers have ignored scientists&apos; advice that a cull will have a marginal effect on bovine TB. The scientists also confirm that the cull could spread TB in cattle if farmers fail to oversee an effective cull. Ministers should listen to the scientists and can this cull, which is bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.&quot; A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: &quot;Nobody wants to cull badgers. We took on board all comments received in response to the consultation on licensing. Culling will only take place in the localised areas where it will make a difference, the number of licences will be limited, the licence will specify the maximum number of badgers that can be controlled, and the number of animals controlled will be monitored to guard against local disappearance.&quot; Under the plans approved by Spelman, up to 40 different cull areas would be licensed by Natural England, following two pilot studies. In its advice, Natural England estimated the number of badgers that would be shot over the four-year culls at between 90,000 to 130,000. Its highest estimate, of the proportion of badgers that this represented in the west and south-west of England, was 79%. Its main estimate for the regions was 25% to 54%. &quot;That is a credible and objective assessment of the industry&apos;s aspirations for badger control, and is not the maximum extent to which culling could occur,&quot; Natural England officials wrote. Across England, the cull would destroy 14-27% of badgers. &quot;It is our view that the local disappearance of the badger in some areas cannot be ruled out.&quot; Humane Society International has already brought a complaint against Spelman under the Bern Convention, which protects European wildlife. Mark Jones, the executive director of HSI UK, said: &quot;The Bern Convention states there should not be &apos;significant disruption&apos; of badger populations, and we don&apos;t think the government&apos;s culling plans can possibly avoid this. It is certain that whole clans of badgers will be wiped out.&quot; Natural England expressed other concerns, in particular that the planned cull deviated from a landmark 10-year trial which ended in 2006. The new cull areas will be much larger and will have no upper size limit. Badgers will be shot in the wild at night, rather than being trapped first, as in the 10-year trial. Most crucially, the culls will be led by farmers and landowners, rather than the government. The government accepts that culling has to kill at least 70% of the badgers in an area and continue for four years. But Natural England stated that, if farmers did abandon a cull, there was no detailed plan on how it would be completed. The advisers also warned that there was no up-to-date estimate of the national badger population, and that farmers would not have to conduct surveys before or after shooting. A new 1m national survey has been commissioned but will not be completed until 2013. &quot;Badger culling has become a costly distraction from the important business of controlling cattle TB,&quot; said Rosie Woodroffe, a badger ecologist at the Institute of Zoology in London, who worked on the 10-year culling trial.",

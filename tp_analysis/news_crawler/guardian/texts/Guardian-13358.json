    "headline": "Which processor for a laptop, and will it be throttled?", 
    "text": "I&apos;m choosing my new laptop to run Microsoft Visual Studio, among other things. My first choice has one drawback: a Core i5 rather than a Core i7. What would I miss? Also, I gather some manufacturers throttle the CPUs to reduce heat and the need for fans, too.Steve Lamb Short answer: you won&apos;t see any difference in general use, but there might well be a difference if you run a demanding test, such as a long compilation in Visual Studio. Otherwise, you can regard all laptop chips as &quot;throttled&quot; in the sense that their performance is optimised for particular configurations, both to reduce heat and prolong battery life. The long answer is that the choice depends more on the specific processors in question than on Intel&apos;s branding, and that laptop processors are now less about performance and more about &quot;performance per Watt&quot;. Intel has designed its Core range of PC processors to target different market segments. The Core i3 is for &quot;value&quot; systems, the i5 for the mainstream, and the i7 for prestige products and tech enthusiasts, especially gamers. There are also versions branded with the old Pentium and Celeron names for PCs where users are looking mainly for a low price. The Core i3 lacks the SpeedStep turbo feature of the i5 and i7 so it&apos;s at the bottom of the posh range, but it&apos;s also top of the cheap range. Part names are not just random numbers. The rule of thumb with Intel (and many other manufacturers) is that bigger numbers are better. A Core i7 is generally better than a Core i5. Similarly, a Core i7-3xxx (third generation Ivy Bridge) is better than a Core i7-2xxx (second generation Sandy Bridge), while a Core i7-3540M (3.0GHz Mobile) is better than a Core i7-3520M (2.9GHz Mobile).  As an ordinary user sitting at a PC, it&apos;s unlikely you&apos;d be able to tell the difference between any of these chips, so it&apos;s tempting to describe this as a marketing exercise. However, the chips have real technical differences that lead to different performance characteristics.  Processors generally perform better if they have more cores, if each core can run more than one process (a technique Intel calls Hyperthreading), and if there is more cache memory to feed instructions to the processor. The Core i7 chips, for example, usually have more cores (up to six), Hyperthreading, bigger caches and better HD 4000 integrated graphics.  However, not every i7 chip is faster than every i5. The situation is complicated by the thermal design power (TDP) in watts. This is the amount of heat the cooling system has to dissipate. If the processor gets too hot, it will have to be throttled or shut down or it will melt. Performance per Watt As mentioned above, with today&apos;s laptop chips, you&apos;re not paying for speed but for speed per watt. For example, a Core i5 with a TDP of 35W may run faster than a Core i7 with a TDP of 17W, but it will run hotter. It will therefore need a bigger battery to get the same battery life, more stuff to cool the processor, and so on. Low-power parts enable PC manufactures to build thinner laptops, but you may be happy to trade some bulk for a lower price or a faster chip. If you really want speed, buy a desktop tower (lots of cooling space) that can handle a hot processor such as the 3.5GHz Intel Core i7-3970X EE. (In Intel-speak, X means extreme and EE stands for extreme edition, so it&apos;s an extreme extreme.) This has six cores, 15MB of SmartCache memory and a TDP of 150W. It also costs $1,059 for a retail version, but obviously there are much cheaper desktop processors. Intel&apos;s mobile (M) chips typically have TDPs of 25W to 45W, while the ultramobile (U, UM) versions are 17W or less. Below those there&apos;s the 1.5GHz Core i7-3689Y, which has only two cores, 4MB of cache, and a TDP of 13W. It&apos;s slower than some Pentium chips, but it&apos;s probably intended for tablets rather than laptops. For this sort of use, the Core i7-3689Y has a &quot;Scenario Design Power&quot; (SDP) of 7W.  Intel is suggesting that, in a tablet, you can run the Core i7-3689Y much more slowly to generate less heat and get more battery life. This is unusual, but all manufacturers have their own scenarios when they design laptops for different markets (workstation, desktop replacement, entertainment system, portable, ultraportable etc). Given all these complications, the best thing to do is to narrow the choice down to two or three laptops and then look up their processors on NotebookCheck&apos;s  CPU Benchmarks table. They are listed in speed order so you can see whether there are big gaps between them or whether they will actually have pretty similar performance. Throttling All this assumes that each manufacturer is following Intel&apos;s TPD recommendations but they don&apos;t have to. Some manufacturers may want to fit extra cooling and &quot;overclock&quot; the chips to make them run faster. This appeals to gamers. Others may choose to limit the performance to fit a processor into a thinner, lighter laptop, while also ensuring that the case doesn&apos;t get too hot to the touch. It&apos;s a balancing act. Windows laptops allow users some degree of control through the power settings. There will be &quot;high performance&quot; options where the processor runs at more or less full speed, preferably on mains power, and &quot;long battery life&quot; settings where the chip&apos;s speed is reduced, the screen brightness turned down and so on. You may even get a slider control that lets you decide how fast to run the processor to achieve a certain battery life. Today&apos;s Windows machines are so powerful that the CPU spends most of its time doing nothing very much, and as I type this in Microsoft Word, I&apos;m using less than 1% of my dual-core processor. The only people likely to notice throttling are the ones doing heavyweight tasks such as encoding videos or playing high-end games that use the full power of the processor for extended periods. In these cases, the key temperature is not the core of the chip (Tcore) but the top surface of the processor packaging (Tcase), where it meets the heat sink. For example, Intel lists the Tcase of the Core i7-3970X EE as 66.8C. Beyond that, you can expect the CPU to be throttled or shut down. Sometimes users dispute the settings with manufacturers. In one case, Dell said it learned from &quot;a small number of customers who have reported issues related to throttling&quot; that &quot;we could improve thermal algorithms that dictate throttling thresholds on our mainstream business-class product line&quot;, so it revised its BIOS chips. I&apos;m not a Microsoft Visual Studio user, but it seems to be quite a heavyweight program, so more cores and more memory would help. However, a Core i5 with 4GB can certainly do the job. Microsoft&apos;s Scott Guthrie reckons the processor isn&apos;t the main bottleneck with Visual Studio: the real blocker is a slow hard drive. In 2007, in Tip/Trick: Hard Drive Speed and Visual Studio Performance, he suggested getting a 7,200RPM or 10,000RPM drive rather than a slow 5,400RPM model. Today, I expect he&apos;d recommend an SSD (solid state drive) or at least a hybrid drive such as a Seagate Momentus XT.",

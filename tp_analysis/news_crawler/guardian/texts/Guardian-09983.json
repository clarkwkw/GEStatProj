    "text": "In the shadow of Halo 4 and next week&apos;s Call Of Duty, publishers are erring on the side of caution, leaving a slightly anaemic release schedule that includes Mass Effect Trilogy (Xbox, PS3, PC), a box set of all three of Commander Shepard&apos;s outings and downloadable content; Saints Row The Third: The Full Package (Xbox, PS3, PC), last year&apos;s wilfully nutty Saints Row episode along with all its post-release add-ons; and Tropico 4: Gold Edition (Xbox, PC), yet another accessorised 2011 game. Marvel Avengers: Battle For Earth (Xbox) is at least new if not very good, adding head-shakingly poor Kinect interaction to repetitive superhero battles. Also available to download is The Greatest Video Game Music 2, which has the London Philharmonic performing old favourites like the themes from Chrono Trigger, LittleBigPlanet and Skyrim among others.",

Image: Dan Logen, 10 February 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. D300, 600 mm lens, ISO 1250, 1/3200 sec, f/4    Question: This African mystery bird species is characterised by a physical character that is visible in this photograph. This character is consistent with the bird&apos;s taxonomic family but at the same time, it is distinct from its family members. What physical trait am I referring to? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult female Tacazze sunbird, Nectarinia tacazze, a lovely bird that gets its common name from the Tacazze River in northern Ethiopia where this species was reportedly first collected. The male of this dichromatic species is a stunning iridescent purple and green, and this species probably forms a superspecies with its closest relatives, Bocage&apos;s sunbird, N. bocagii, and the purple-breasted sunbird, N. purpureiventris.  This species is placed into the taxonomic family, Nectariniidae, the sunbirds and spiderhunters. The nectarivorous sunbirds are the ecological equivalent of New World hummingbirds and Australian honeyeaters. The sunbirds are small with colourful, often iridescent, plumage and long, thin, decurved bills.  Like all sunbirds, our mystery bird has a long, thin decurved bill, but its bill is comparatively straight when compared to other sunbird species (although this is not be apparent in our mystery bird due to the angle of the photograph).  The Tacazze sunbird lives in open highland and bamboo forests, in heathlands and even in cultivated areas from 1750 to 4250m in elevation. For this reason, the Tacazze sunbird is the largest of all the sunbirds. Its elongated central tail feathers make it seem even larger. Their east African range includes Eritrea and Ethiopia as well as parts of Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Similar to hummingbirds, Tacazze sunbirds aggressively protect their feeding territories from all other birds.

    "text": "Jessica Guiver, international development officer, York St John University Manage students&apos; expectations from the outset: As a recruiter, it is my responsibility to encourage students to apply to my university, but it is equally my responsibility to paint an honest picture of the university. We as institutions are setting ourselves up for failure if we allow students to get very high hopes or expectations based on information that is in any way inaccurate. The international student experience begins even before the student has applied to the university, and it&apos;s very important to remember that. We must also manage expectations when overseas students are looking for part-time work while they study. While they might want to find a job within their intended field so that they get career experience, this is not often the case even for British students, who will usually work in hospitality or retail. Always be clear about the employment options available, speak about the wider benefits of gaining experience, unless of course a placement in industry is part of their course. Beatrice Merrick, director of services and research, UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) Government policy matters: The Prime Minister&apos;s Initiative, a five year strategy to increase the number of international students in the UK, was a great example of how national governments can add value to what individual institutions are doing with only a modest investment. Current immigration policy is certainly making life harder for international students though the Scottish government, unlike its Westminster counterpart, is still investing in these sorts of initiatives. The experience of individuals is much more affected by what happens at the local level, but national policies can provide a supportive framework and allow for shared innovation and experimentation Responsibility for overseas student experience lies ultimately with the university: Studying abroad is inherently challenging and builds independence and maturity. While international students are very effective at building their own support groups (see Catherine Montgomery&apos;s research on this), that doesn&apos;t absolve institutions of responsibility to help, especially recognising that international students are generally further from their families and existing support networks, in what may be an unfamiliar language and culture. Christina Yan Zhang, international students officer, National Union of Students  Understand the decision-making process for international students: As a Chinese student, I can speak from personal experience. Like most overseas students, I was not able to come to attend an open day so my choice to study at Loughborough was based on the following:  Overall ranking of the university: I checked the Times Higher Education tables, Sunday Times and the Guardian [university guide]. Loughborough was ranked sixth the year I came to do my master&apos;s degree.  Subject ranking for the course: My media course has been among top three in the UK for many years. The department had also received a Queen&apos;s Anniversary Prize for excellence in research.  Alumni: A Chinese talk show host graduated from my department. Well known alumni give prospective students some idea of what job opportunities might be available to them when they return.  Overall prestige in home country: Loughborough University is well known in China, with graduation ceremonies held there as well.  Quality of overall students experience: I wanted to have a holistic experience of studying in the UK. Loughborough University was voted by their students to have &quot;the best students experience in the UK&quot; for many years. The students union also matters for overseas students. Dave Burnapp, national teaching fellow, The University of Northampton Be honest and give quality of information: Making honest promises is fundamental. A problem can occur when universities do not have direct communication with overseas students but use intermediary agents (who sometimes then have sub-agents). There are good intermediaries, but universities should always practise what they preach, and apply critical examination to any work with agents. Overseas students allow for &apos;internationalisation at home&apos;: We should be matching our concern and guidance for students who arrive here with an equal curiosity to explore other cultures of learning. This, of course, raises the issue of what is often called internationalisation-at-home, and how to generate this type of curiosity concerning &apos;other&apos; cultures amongst our domestic communities. Jo Attwooll, policy adviser, Universities UK Ensure that services for international students form part of support services available to all students: Students from certain countries may be more familiar with rote systems of learning and may need support to develop critical thinking skills commonly expected within the UK education system. But these services should not be targeted only at international students but are freely available to any student wishing to use them, as instruction differs at schools within the UK also. Plan for a future of overseas campuses: Many countries which have traditionally sent large numbers of students to the UK are improving their own HE provision which will change the nature of how the UK might educate international students in future, for example through partnerships with universities overseas, through establishing branch campuses in other countries. This will all have a bearing on the experience of international students studying UK degrees but not necessarily in the UK. Emelie Helsen, training and development co-ordinator, City University London Learn from others: Japan has a Global 30 programme funded by MEXT, the department for education. The university representatives we met have some reservations in reaching their targets, because of the global crisis, the tsunami aftermath and the language barriers, but we have seen some great efforts and examples of them in trying to recruit international students to Japan, predominantly in relation to promoting outgoing exchanges. At Doshisha University, the promotion of a student exchange was clear from the onset, embedded across the university - in both academics and support staff. They supported their home students to take the English proficiency tests and provided English classes to prepare them for particular technical use of the language before the students went abroad. A lot of effort goes into providing information to parents, pre-application and pre-departure information such as homestay recommendations. At Kansai and Waseda universities, the academic and support staff stay in touch with their students while they are abroad so they can ease back into life upon their return. Other countries worth learning from include Australia, the third most popular country for international students and the Netherlands. Australia&apos;s focus on the whole student experience (and not just the learning one) is one to be noted. Their student survey, the NSSE, is more comprehensive that our NSS. Mary Churchill, special assistant to the vice president of institutional advancement at Queens College, City University of New York Develop &apos;global champions&apos; among staff to help break down barriers: We needed to find a way to get all relevant offices on campus to realise that the success of international students was their responsibility, to see themselves as key players in a student&apos;s success. To do this I established Global Champions, staff who like languages, travelling and embracing global diversity. With them, we set up a framework that allowed us to focus on what was working rather than on what people were doing wrong. It also allowed Global Champions to take a leadership role in sharing best practices and personal success stories. Priorities for US institutions:  Comprehensive internationalisation: moving from ad-hoc offices that deal with international issues to a mainstreamed internationalisation where every person in every office has some level of skill and knowledge with regards to internationalisation.  Being strategic: developing a global strategy that also gives an institution a mission for why and how you do what they do when it comes to global initiatives. Kenny Nicholl, director, Hobsons PLC, a leading specialist provider of techonolgy products in HE The keys to successful international student recruitment: The key things that you need to get right are timely and quality responses to enquiries, personalised communication (never underestimate the value of a phone call) and comprehensive orientation programmes pre-arrival. One of the things that often gets forgotten is support on arrival; international students are not the same as home students, the cultural differences and often expectations on them from their families to succeed are not to be underestimated and should be acknowledged. The internet allows you to know your students before they arrive: I&apos;m working with a number of institutions to develop an online orientation system. This is based on the feedback from some of our international university partners who want to have an early insight into knowledge gaps of their students before they even arrive for the first time on campus. The key emphasis being to prepare them for campus life and this does not mean academic life. Noomi Weinberg, account manager, i-graduate, the International Graduate Insight Group Set up buddy schemes and involve your alumni: We keep seeing complaints from international students saying that they are not meeting enough British students. A good welcome programme, with a buddy scheme, will help to make international students feel more integrated in the university community from the start. Societies and clubs are crucial to the social experience that students have, both internationals and home students.Promoting inclusive societies could prove a very effective way to engage international students and make them feel more integrated. Sam Redhead, international student adviser, University of East London Adaptation across the university is essential: At UEL we have workshops that are popular with staff, such as &apos;building cross-cultural understanding: supporting international students&apos;. We also have Country Explore Guides available to enable staff to gain a better perspective on a variety of countries and cultures. The international student advice team runs regular workshops with staff around basic immigration issues, to ensure that academic advice doesn&apos;t clash with a student&apos;s responsibilities whilst they are in the UK - and also to work closely with staff to adapt to immigration changes in a way that will have the least negative impact on the student experience.

    "text": "Today is the 10th anniversary of the start of trade negotiations between the EU and 76 of the world&apos;s poorest countries. And this morning senior figures in the Trade Justice Movement, representing over 7 million people, will hand in a letter to Vince Cable, warning the deals the EU is pushing these countries to agree would consign many more people to dire hardship. In a white paper last year the business secretary pledged to ensure trade delivered the best results for development. Yet Europe&apos;s negotiations with developing countries continue to be fraught with contentious issues that the EU has failed to address. The deals proposed threaten the loss of significant income from tariff revenues and to undermine agriculture and industry in developing countries. Swaziland, for example, will see duties on its sugar exports rise from zero to 339 per tonne, crippling their sugar industry. Unfair trade rules prevent millions of poor people around the world from escaping poverty and lead to environmental destruction. It is time for new thinking from our political leaders on a better way to structure the global economy for the benefit of people and our planet.Ruth Bergan Trade Justice Movement, Paul Chandler Traidcraft, Deborah Doane World Development Movement, Michael Gidney Fairtrade Foundation, John Hilary War on Want",

    "text": "The Prime Minister once promised to lead &quot;the greenest Government ever&quot;. Today, the government can  and must  live up to the David Cameron&apos;s rhetoric by supporting the European Commission&apos;s proposal to protect bees and other pollinators by suspending the use of neonicotinoid insecticides. Neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides. They are generally applied as a seed treatment, which means the chemical permeates the plant whether or not it is being attacked by pests or being visited by friendly pollinators. In her seminal book, Silent Spring, Rachel Carson vividly described the damage that can be done by systemic insecticides: &quot;The world of systemic insecticides is a weird world, surpassing the imaginings of the brothers Grimm. It is a world where the enchanted forest of the fairy tales has become a poisonous forest. It is a world where a flea bites a dog and dies  where a bee may carry poisonous nectar back to its hive and presently produce poisonous honey.&quot; Remarkably, 50 years have passed since Carson wrote those words. My committee investigated this issue this year, and not one of our many witnesses challenged the idea that wild bees and other pollinators have experienced severe declines in the UK. Emerging peer-reviewed science suggests the use of neonicotinoids may well be responsible for those declines. At the start of our inquiry, government ministers argued it would require &quot;unequivocal evidence&quot; of harm before taking action. That is of course notoriously difficult to produce. But it is also inconsistent with the precautionary principle, which the government belatedly remembered that it had already signed up to in European treaties. We could wait indefinitely for unequivocal evidence, but why take such a big risk with bees when we know they are so vital to food production? Albert Einstein is reputed to have said that &quot;if the bee disappeared off the face of the Earth, man would only have four years left to live&quot;. Inconveniently, it is unclear if the great scientist actually made that remark. But the contribution that insect pollinators make to UK agriculture is crystal clear. Hand-pollinating crops, if bees vanished, would cost 1.8bn a year, dramatically pushing up prices and the world would face a food crisis. At Prime Minister&apos;s Questions last week I tackled David Cameron over whether he would back the European Commission&apos;s precautionary ban. He dodged the question, saying he was the life patron of the Oxfordshire Beekeepers&apos; Association, but had &quot;been neglecting his duties recently&quot;, to which someone shouted &quot;resign!&quot;. He did, however, promise to look very carefully at the issue. For the future of farming, Britain&apos;s biodiversity, and indeed Oxfordshire&apos;s bees, I hope he doesn&apos;t neglect his duties as prime minister and ignore the mounting weight of evidence indicating these pesticides are posing a serious problem for pollinators. The government must take precautionary action before it is too late and back the EU vote for a moratorium today.  Joan Walley MP is chair of the environmental audit committee",

    "text": "The UK government&apos;s reliance on the UN to deliver support for elections overseas has left the British aid programme &quot;uncomfortably exposed&quot;, the Independent Commission on Aid Impact (Icai) warned in a report published on Wednesday. Over the past decade, the Department for International Development (DfID) spent 197m supporting elections in 26 developing countries. Just over 70% of that (140m) was spent through the UN Development Programme (UNDP). In a report evaluating UK funding for UNDP-led projects, Icai said the UN agency may deliver &quot;technically sound assistance&quot;, but tends to prioritise short-term projects over the development of local capacity. In some cases, it said, this has left countries in need of continuing aid. Working with the UNDP has often meant dealing with short-term planning, according to the report, along with delays in aid delivery, an emphasis on fundraising over cost control and attention to &quot;value for money&quot;, and a tendency to support overly complex technical solutions at the expense of developing sustainable systems. It said UK aid through the UNDP has contributed to the successful conduct of individual elections, but that DfID should seek other partners and reduce its dependence on the UN agency. The Icai chief commissioner, Graham Ward, said UK assistance has helped reduce the risks of conflict and political crises. &quot;There are, however, tensions between the imperative to deliver elections successfully and the goal of long-term capacity building,&quot; he said. &quot;DfID needs to consider more carefully how to balance these two goals.&quot; The report cites the example of the May 2009 elections in Malawi, which fell short of international standards according to some observers, including the EU. DfID contributed 4.5m (36%) to the UNDP&apos;s 12.5m project to improve the management and technical capacity of the national electoral commission and help deliver the elections. Although peaceful elections were held, and considered an improvement on those in 2004, with voter turnout rising to 78% from 54%, the report criticised UNDP technical assistance for failing to sustainably transfer knowledge and skills to local authorities. Icai found &quot;no sustainable impact on capacity for running elections&quot;, and warned that future elections in the country are likely to need similar levels of support. The 2008 parliamentary elections in Bangladesh are cited as an exception  the UNDP had supported the national electoral commission for 10 years before the elections. But even here, Icai said it found little evidence the country could manage future elections without international assistance. The report says the UNDP is too often constrained by its political mandate to maintain relationships with the government of the day. &quot;This makes them reluctant to deliver hard messages on behalf of the international community,&quot; it says, adding that the agency tends to limit its engagement with opposition parties and civil society groups critical of the government. Icai remained unconvinced that the UNDP maximises &quot;value for money&quot;. It said it found no evidence of effective cost controls and that it instead saw examples of where the UN agency seemed to measure its success based on how much money it raised. &quot;UNDP&apos;s chief concern is to mobilise funding from bilateral donors for its electoral assistance, rather than to control costs,&quot; it said. According to the report, a tendency to choose complex or technologically advanced equipment is a key problem in how UNDP-led election support is often delivered. The report questioned the use of UK aid for projects in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to use biometric technology for voter registration, requiring laptops, webcams, fingerprint scanners, colour printers and mobile generators. Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, said his department was working closely with the UNDP to &quot;ensure their projects are well-planned and deliver constant value for money, especially in fragile and conflict-ridden states. I fully support the commission&apos;s findings and will continue to work with the UN to implement them.&quot; Last year, the UK multilateral aid review concluded that the UNDP delivered good &quot;value for money&quot; but raised concerns about the UN agency&apos;s financial management and ability to demonstrate results. DfID says it will support 300 million voters in elections in 13 countries by 2015  including those in Kenya and Sierra Leone this year. Past electoral assistance has included support for the design of voting systems, the determination of electoral boundaries, voter registration and education projects, and training for political parties and the media.",

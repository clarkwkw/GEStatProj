    "text": "    Due to its Swedish-derived name, this week&apos;s element has a name with a gloriously finger-twisting spelling. Its name, ytterbium, rhymes with those of its &quot;sister&quot; elements as Tom Lehrer has so delightfully demonstrated.  Ytterbium&apos;s atomic symbol is Yb and its atomic number is 70. In its pure form, it is a lustrous silver-coloured element that is soft, malleable and ductile. It is one of the rarest of the rare earth elements, but even still, it&apos;s roughly twice as common in the Earth&apos;s crust as tin.  Although it is present in miniscule quantities in the human body, ytterbium doesn&apos;t appear to be essential for life (although lichens do have comparatively high levels in their tissues). Thus, I don&apos;t have much to share from a biological viewpoint except to point out that direct contact with its salts can result in a nasty a skin and eye irritation, and there is some evidence to indicate that ytterbium chloride causes developmental abnormalities, particularly birth defects [doi:10.1002/tera.1420110308] Despite its relative rarity, ytterbium is finding some uses as a dopant in high power and wavelength-tunable lasers, and in stainless steel. However, the chemistry of this element is still poorly known.  Possibly the most interesting characteristic of Ytterbium is the variation it shows in its electrical conductivity as pressure increases. At 16,000 atmospheres, it behaves as a semiconductor. Its electrical resistance increases with increasing pressure. But at 40,000 atmospheres, this trend suddenly reverses and ytterbium once again becomes increasingly more conducting. For this reason, ytterbium is used in stress gauges to monitor shock waves and deformations in the earth&apos;s crust from nuclear explosions and earthquakes.  Here&apos;s several of our favourite chemists telling us a little more about ytterbium:            [video link] .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

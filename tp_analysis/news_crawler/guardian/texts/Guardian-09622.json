    "text": "My nine-year-old has called me at work. &quot;Mum, it came and it&apos;s so cool.&quot; We had been eagerly anticipating the arrival of a review copy of the new Moshi Monsters game for the Nintendo DS. For a nine-year-old well-versed in the world of Moshis  we&apos;ve got the posters, the stickers, the magazines, the cuddly toy, the lampshade  sorry, stop me there - this is Christmas come early. The last game, Moshi Monsters: Moshlings Zoo, spent 23 weeks at No 1 in the UK DS chart, so I&apos;m guessing my daughter is not alone in her excitement. So, how does Moshi Monsters: Moshlings Theme Park stack up? Allow one overexcited expert to tell you: &quot;What I really like about it is that it is so different to the last one. It&apos;s got different graphics and a really good story. Basically, you&apos;re taking all your Moshlings from Moshling Zoo on holiday to a fun park. &quot;You have to travel through worlds and make the Moshi fun park even bigger and more fun. You play lots of fun games along the way like Katsuma&apos;s Bounce. It&apos;s so different and exciting, it&apos;s like a world of its own. You don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen next. &quot;I gave the first game six out of 10 but this one has really improved. I give it 9 out of 10. Next time they bring one out it&apos;s probably going to be a tenner.&quot; Kitty Croft, age nine Moshi Monsters: Moshlings Theme Park for Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS is out now",

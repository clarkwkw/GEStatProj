    "text": "The scale of migration is striking: more than 215 million people are living and working outside the countries of their birth, with many more moving within their home country. What does this mean for developing countries? South-south migration has eclipsed south-north movement, with India among the top 10 destination countries. Climate change, food security and job prospects are just some of the reasons why people move. According to the World Bank, remittances to developing countries reached an estimated $406bn last year (pdf), with unrecorded flows thought to be much higher. In this month&apos;s podcast we look at trends in migration, asking whether it can  and should  be seen as a tool for development. John Vidal, the Guardian&apos;s environment editor, is joined in the studio by Sylvie Aboa-Bradwell, executive director of African Peoples Advocacy, which provides a platform for African engagement in the UK. Michael Clemens, from the Center for Global Development thinktank, who argues that human mobility is central to a strong global economy, is down the line from Washington. Theodora Xenogiani, economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&apos;s Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs, contributes from Paris and we have inserts from Aajeevika, an organisation that works with migrants in India, and Professor Mariama Awumbila of the University of Ghana. What&apos;s the relationship between migration and development? Do people who migrate from developing countries have an obligation to support development at home? Should migration reform be seen as aid 2.0?",

    "text": "Jan Perry, landlady of the Old Mill House Inn in Polperro, pulls open the double doors of the fridge-freezer in the kitchen. The stream of water passing through her pub runs over her rubber boots and continues down the corridor past the pool room into the beer garden. &quot;With the electrics out, all this food will be wasted,&quot; she says. &quot;There are 200 fresh scallops here. All ruined now.&quot; Since Perry took over the pub 10 years ago, she has got used to the river Pol topping over during intense downpours and wetting the wooden floors of the saloon. A quick mop up in the morning and a blast of the heater cures it, she says, but she&apos;s never seen flooding like the torrent that swept through her pub on Saturday evening. Two foot of standing water now blocks the pub&apos;s entrance and at the peak of the flooding at 11pm, a stream a foot deep was pouring through the ground floor of the building. &quot;We had two guests staying with us,&quot; says Perry. &quot;We gave them a bottle of wine each and told them to just stay in their rooms upstairs out of danger. They were wonderful about it all. In the morning, they crawled out of a downstairs window and wished us luck.&quot; Cornwall had two inches of rain on Saturday and the emergency services said they had responded to more than 350 incidents. Towns across the county were affected with the most significant damage reported in Mevagissey, Polperro, Helston, Millbrook, Perranporth and Newlyn. The Environment Agency issued &quot;severe&quot; (danger to life) flood warnings for both Helston and Polperro. In total, police said, about 80 properties were flooded across the county, with a handful of roads and trainlines closed due to landslips and localised flooding. Perry says she does not know how long it will take to clean up the flood damage in her pub, the worst-hit property in Polperro. &quot;All the flooring will have to be replaced for starters. Luckily, I&apos;m insured for flooding. But how much will that cost to renew now? This makes me angry, though, as we&apos;d already been having discussions with the council and the Highways Agency about the problems with the drain in the street outside.&quot; A flood in 1976 killed the elderly father of the pub&apos;s former owner when he was swept away. The 1993 flood reached the first floor. Perry says: &quot;The flood tunnel built to protect Polperro after the 1993 flood worked well last night. It&apos;s the runoff from the hills to the side of the town that has done the damage. Everyone knew we were at risk. But, as usual, it has to take something like this to get anyone to take proper notice. The funny thing is that we were actually meant to be going to see our MP about it next week.&quot; PC Helen Libby and Sergeant Russ Hall of the community policing team for south-east Cornwall put their heads through the window and ask Perry if there&apos;s anything they can do to help. Perry pleads with them to get the fire brigade to bring a vehicle down to the town to pump away the standing water outside the pub. Her morning-long effort to reach them on the phone has so far failed. The officers radio for help and continue on their round of the flood-stricken town. Perry looks at the sodden, muddy floor and sighs. &quot;The only thing I know with certainty at the moment is that quiz night on Tuesday is cancelled.&quot;",

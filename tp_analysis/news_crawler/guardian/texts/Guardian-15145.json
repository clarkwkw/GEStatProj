    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Dead Island: Riptide begins with an escape from the original game&apos;s zombie-infested holiday island. Your bunch of feeble-minded caricatures are then captured by the army and shipwrecked on a neighbouring island, which turns out to be identical in every respect, with the same huts, badly drawn jungle and nasty case of the undead. As before, you&apos;re there to do favours for people, which amount to fetching items that have zombies hanging about nearby. It&apos;s a mechanic that wears thin very quickly and is further undermined by the game&apos;s almost skill-free combat. Enduring some of the quickest-to-fail weapons ever implemented, you&apos;ll pour far too much time into repairing useful ones. Apart from a few innovations, this is the same game as Dead Island, complete with dated visuals and some head-shakingly terrible voice acting.",

    "text": "Last November I wrote a news story about how a register of meetings released by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) under freedom of information legislation had exposed the extent to which senior civil servants had been wined and dined by nuclear industry lobbyists. The register was revealing on two levels: first, it showed how there had been dozens of meetings since Decc&apos;s Office for Nuclear Development (OND) had been formed in 2009; second, it showed just how lavish the hospitality offered by the lobbyists had been with meetings regularly taking place at some of London&apos;s most luxurious restaurants and hotels. Craig Bennett, the director of policy and campaigns at Friends of the Earth, remarked at the time: &quot;What the taxpayer should be asking is whether this succession of lavish hospitality has resulted in lavish subsidies for nuclear.&quot; There was, unsurprisingly, a strong reaction from readers to the story. But some, rightly, asked me via the comments or Twitter if comparable registers of meetings were available for the senior civil servants working with other sectors such as oil and gas (known as the &quot;Energy Development Unit&quot;), and renewables (&quot;Office for Renewable Energy Deployment&quot;). It has taken more than two months to get hold of them, via a freedom of information request, but they are now in my possession. What they reveal is that lobbyists from the renewables sector and oil and gas sector do indeed have meetings with senior civil servants at Decc  as you might expect  but that the nuclear lobbyists are in a different league when it comes to the lavishness and frequency of meetings. Here is Decc&apos;s note of explanation I received alongside the registers:  Decc have defined hospitality as including the acceptance of meals and drinks, provided by external organisations at events. The definition does not include, however, minor refreshments or sandwich lunches at such events. Tables of relevant entries from the hospitality registers are attached at Annex 1 and Annex 2. The latter schedule relates to a retiree from the Energy Development Unit. Job titles for the individuals and additional notes under the column titled &apos;purpose&apos; have been added as necessary to help put the information into context. Please note that the expenses of and hospitality received by Senior Civil Servants at Director General level and above are published at https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/business-expenses-senior-officials in accordance with Cabinet Office guidance.  And here are the registers so you can peruse them yourselves... Annex 1Annex 2OND Register (released last November) My own view of lobbyists is that they are not a &quot;bad&quot; influence, per se, as some view them. Governments need to hear a wide range of views when formulating, then implementing, new policies, including the views of vested interests. But I do think full transparency is required if we are ever to trust this process. There have been too many scandals involving lobbyists working in the shadows to allow the status quo to continue. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and this is never truer than with the influence of lobbyists. Why aren&apos;t these hospitality registers published on ministry websites as a matter of routine, as is now the case with ministerial &quot;meetings with external organisations&quot;? (For example, such lists allowed me to ascertain last July that ministers at the Treasury have held meetings with representatives from energy-intensive sectors seven times more often than with green sector representatives.) As a general rule, lobbyists want to meet with ministers when policies are being formulated. But when it moves on to policy implementation, lobbyists would rather get the ear of the senior civil servants charged with this particular task. The public deserves full transparency across both these policy stages. In fact, we deserve to know about every point of contact between ministers and civil servants and &quot;external organisations&quot;, as was illustrated by the revelation last August - again, extracted via freedom of information legislation - that Shell was laying on &quot;training courses&quot; for senior civil servants. Furthermore, these lists need to be maintained across departments using a standardised format. For example, with the OND list released last November we got to know the precise venue of each meeting. That a meeting took place over a one-to-one dinner at the five-star Berkeley hotel in London possibly holds a different significance to one that took place at a chance meeting at an annual awards event. But such detail is missing from the lists I have just obtained related to the renewables and oil/gas sectors. (I have asked for it to be supplied and will update this article later if I secure it.) And why has hospitality that entailed &quot;minor refreshments or sandwich lunches&quot; at events provided by outside groups been omitted from the register? To achieve full transparency and accountability, we need to know about all meetings with lobbyists and outside groups, regardless of whether the civil servant was served a Chateaubriand steak and a bottle of the finest Pomerol, or just a limp cucumber sandwich and a glass of tap water. The need-to-know information is that a meeting and a conversation took place. We also need to know the Who, When, Where and Why. Even greater transparency would be achieved if the register actually included meaningful detail about what precisely was discussed. At the moment, the best we seem to get are bland declarations that the purpose of the meeting was &quot;to discuss energy related matters&quot;. You don&apos;t say... Finally, here are just a couple of my own observations from the newly released registers. First, it seems that the interaction between senior civil servants and the renewables industry  and to a lesser extent, the oil/gas industries - largely took place at awards events. This contrasts with the nuclear lobbyists who prefer, it seems, to meet with senior civil servants in the more intimate, luxurious surroundings of a fancy restaurant. I know not why. Second, the hospitality enjoyed by Ian McKenzie, head of coal liabilities at the Energy Development Unit, particularly caught my eye. He had five meetings with the law firm Nabarro. The two meetings last year were to, firstly, &quot;mark the conclusion of the COPD Compensation Scheme&quot;, and then, four months later, to &quot;discuss forward programme of work&quot;. COPD stands for &quot;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot; and the compensation scheme referred to was set up to deal with the claims of 760,000 miners who have suffered from the condition. But the scheme has been been dogged by reports of law firms &quot;exploiting&quot; the scheme. As one legal journalist put it last year, &quot;the exploitation [of the scheme] by a few solicitorshas been arguably the profession&apos;s darkest hour&quot;. &quot;Exploitation&quot; is a particular allegation and a separate debate, but it is certainly true that some law firms have earned millions from the scheme. As my colleague Damian Carrington wrote in 2010:  The legacy of ill health suffered by British Coal miners is also costing taxpayers millions. Since May, DECC has paid 7.3m to legal firms fighting compensation claims from miners. Nabarro alone received 3m.  Readers can judge how appropriate it was for McKenzie to be enjoying &quot;drinks and canaps&quot; with Nabarro to mark the end of the scheme and then a few month later to be meeting with them again - this time for &quot;lunch&quot; - to &quot;discuss a forward programme of work&quot;. But the wider and more important point is at least we now know those meetings took place. Now we need government departments to publish this information as a matter of routine, rather than force people to use freedom of information legislation to extract it from them.",

    "text": "It was not my first pike of the year. Earlier this month I had found the monster in miniature, 5in long and inert aside from the restless to and fro of the anal fin, the creature&apos;s outline broken by the shade of surface weed, when the tiger stripes were perfect camouflage. However, this new one was the real thing. It weighed several pounds, and behind the gills its girth was so great that it would have taken both my hands to measure the body&apos;s circumference. But at this point the flesh of the body had been scooped out and eaten. From my position on the opposite bank, it looked as if the neck bones had also been severed. In fact, the pike&apos;s whole head, showing the signature smile of this guiltless killer, lay at an acute angle to the curving line of its body. I imagined the fish&apos;s final moments: the otter, possibly only four times the weight of its victim, must have manoeuvred the huge prey out of the reeds and on to thebank. The pike would have been clamped by those long, lutrine teeth and, while the tail fin might have lashed and the gills pumped, it would have been to no avail. The reason for the otter&apos;s failure to complete the meal I pieced together from the circumstances of my discovery. Just before I&apos;d spotted the fish, a man had cycled past and, I realised, must have disturbed the otter&apos;s feast, forcing it back into the water and downstream. I arrived at the scene of the killing just minutes later, when the pike&apos;s body scales were already acquiring the pinkish-brown mottling of a fish carcass in sunlight. While I stood puzzling on the tableau,I caught the head of the otter returning. I instantly backed away andthen a dark shape emerged from the grass. I could sense the electric sensitivity of those wire-like vibrissae as they sampled the air. Alas, the wind was blowing directly from me to the otter and itnever appeared again.",

    "text": "In 2010, only 40% of modules at the University of Huddersfield could boast a reading list. No longer. It might not have reached every single module quite yet, but it&apos;s anticipated that MyReading, the interactive reading list software developed by a 10-strong in-house team dedicated to the project will soon have 100% coverage. MyReading fulfills a range of functions. It provides access to reading lists and journal articles, and links to videos, art and music websites. It&apos;s directly linked to the library&apos;s automated purchasing system, so texts are bought based on constantly updated numbers of those on a course roll. Academics can see in real time how their students are engaging with recommended texts, and live statistical information on software usage is prominently displayed. It also gives enhanced access to full texts online as well as allowing interaction between students and staff. Students can feed back on their user experience, and staff can add notes, receive alerts of new editions of their suggested texts, and can update their lists instantly as required. &quot;Research has shown that there is a direct link between degree classifications and library useage,&quot; says Eileen Hiller, head of academic services for Huddersfield&apos;s computing and library services. &quot;MyReading, by enhancing and easing the process, is poised to play a role in improving qualifications and the career prospects of students from all backgrounds.&quot;",

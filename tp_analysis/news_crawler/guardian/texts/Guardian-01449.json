    "text": "Luluvise describes itself as &quot;a social network for women&quot;. It&apos;s loved by the technology media, racking up plenty of friendly articles since its launch late last year. Its founder, Alexandra Chong, even has a regular column in the Sunday Times about life in a startup. Luluvise&apos;s PR team frequently spotlights one particular feature: WikiDate, in which women on the Luluvise network  who must sign in using their Facebook account  can rate the men that they&apos;ve dated. Facebook&apos;s privacy page has the innocuous statement: &quot;People who can see your info can bring it with them when they use apps.&quot; This means that when your friend signs into an application, they don&apos;t just share their own data  they can share some of your data as well. And if you haven&apos;t looked through the deep parts of Facebook&apos;s privacy settings, that could be a lot of personal information: by default, it includes your status updates, photos, birthday, family details, and biography. A truly malicious application could happily store all those details  and while Facebook has policies in place to cut off rogue applications, detecting abuse isn&apos;t the easiest of tasks. Luluvise&apos;s site was in violation of Facebook&apos;s policies for at least a month. When a Facebook user joins Luluvise, it pulls in the names of the men that they know; if a user decides to rate any of them, it then generates a public-facing page announcing that the man has been reviewed. Originally, that page featured more than just a name: it included the man&apos;s photograph, pulled from his Facebook account. I asked Joelle Hadfield, Luluvise&apos;s head of PR, how that complied with Facebook&apos;s Platform Policies, which prohibit using users&apos; friends&apos; data for anything public. She said: &quot;We are pleased to work closely with Facebook, and so naturally we are committed to abiding by their Platform Policy.&quot; However, after I contacted Facebook for comment, Luluvise altered its site. At Facebook&apos;s request, it&apos;s no longer showing the profile photos of the men in its system. However, it is still showing name and location details publicly  along with a &quot;dating score&quot; for those logged into the site. It&apos;s questionable whether the Data Protection Act allows Luluvise to keep that information. Sensitive personal data  including details of someone&apos;s sex life  is handled under Schedule 3 of the Data Protection Act, and can only be processed under certain strict conditions or with the subject&apos;s explicit consent. I asked the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office if WikiDate violated the act; they were unable to answer immediately, but said they&apos;d get in touch with Luluvise to &quot;better understand how their service works and to ensure compliance with the law&quot;. That process may take several weeks. Even if it does end up with significant changes to this one particular site, the act doesn&apos;t apply to any companies outside the UK. Facebook, however, has confirmed to me that Luluvise is now compliant with its policies. That&apos;s startling  because it means that maintaining a public page, accessible to search engines, announcing that a Facebook user has &quot;WikiDate reviews&quot; on a site that they&apos;ve never joined and will never be allowed to, is permitted by Facebook. There are some big issues here I&apos;m not qualified to comment on. WikiDate doesn&apos;t care about anyone who&apos;s gay, or anyone who doesn&apos;t fit strictly into &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;. There&apos;s also Luluvise&apos;s stereotyping of women (&quot;We know what girls talk about when they discuss their latest crush&quot;), and the fact that switching WikiDate&apos;s two genders around would make the site a pariah rather than a media darling. Other writers can talk about those issues with more insight and experience than I ever could. I can, however, talk about privacy. Here&apos;s the bottom line: if you use Facebook, and your friends sign up for social applications, your name and details could appear in unexpected places. Of course, you could always not have a Facebook account  that&apos;s the catch-all answer frequently trotted out by the site&apos;s detractors. For many people, though, that&apos;s not an easy option. When your friends run their social lives through the service, not having a Facebook account is like not having a mobile phone or an email address. Yes, you can live without it, but it&apos;s a serious inconvenience that means you&apos;re very much out of the loop. So check your privacy settings, under &quot;Apps and Websites&quot;. You may be surprised what data your friends are giving away  and where it&apos;s ending up.  Tom Scott&apos;s website is tomscott.com; he&apos;s on Twitter at @tomscott",

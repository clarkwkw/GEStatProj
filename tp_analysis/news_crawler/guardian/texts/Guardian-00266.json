    "text": "Efforts to curb global corruption risk being seriously hindered by the UKs failure to persuade its overseas territories to improve their transparency, a high-level report by British MPs warns today. Accusing the UK government of missing an opportunity to build on a major anti-corruption summit that took place in London in May, it calls on Britain to persuade the territories to create public registers of beneficial ownership. A lack of transparency in the entities  nominally still under the UKs auspices, but in practice self-ruled and sometimes operating as controversial tax havens  will continue to damage Britains reputation as a leader on anti-corruption, according to the House of Commons International Development Committee.   Related: Conflicts of interest mar scheme to help poor countries curb tax loss, claim NGOs    Attempts by Britains Department for International Development (DfID) to reduce corruption in developing countries are in danger of being undermined by a lack of policy coherence and the pursuit of different policies by other sections of government, the MPs warn. While commending the UK for showing leadership in the past six years, it adds that the scale of the challenges when it comes to tackling corruption have been underlined by revelations such as those contained in the Panama Papers, an unprecedented leak of millions of documents showing the myriad ways in which the rich can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. It is essential that momentum is not lost in the wake of the decision to leave the European Union, when laws, regulations and trading arrangements are reviewed, says the report, which adds that the UK government must consider the ramifications of Brexit on EU provisions designed to curb corruption. As much as $240bn (195bn) in tax revenue is lost each year due to tax avoidance, according to OECD estimates, with developing countries hit the hardest. The report asks the British government to reconsider whether the best forum for its pursuit of discussions and decisions on international tax matters should actually be the OECD, whose membership is mainly composed of developed countries and which it accused of not adequately reflecting the needs of the poorest countries. The MPs say it is clear from the evidence they received that companies and individuals in the UK as well as in Britains crown dependencies and overseas territories play a major role in facilitating global corruption. By way of example, they quote the evidence of Professor Paul Heywood, an anti-corruption expert at the University of Nottingham, who told the committee the role of banks and the City of London in allowing corrupt money to flow should not be underestimated. It also notes that approximately half of the companies  more than 113,000 in total  that featured in the files released as part of the Panama Papers revelations were registered in the British Virgin Islands, a UK overseas territory. In other findings, it says the registration of large numbers of major oil, gas and mining companies in the UK mean that the British government could play an important role in rooting out the corruption that impacted on resource-rich developing states such as Nigeria.

The report comes after a cross-party group of British MPs claimed a victory last week for corporate tax transparency following the governments acceptance of a legal amendment to legislation that could force multinationals to publicly declare where they do business and the tax they pay. The amendment to the finance bill allows, but does not commit, the government to publication of country-by-country reports produced by multinationals. The committees chair, Labour MP Stephen Twigg, says it has previously called on the UK government to get its own house in order, and this remains the case.  Ministers must address the role of some UK companies and individuals in facilitating global corruption, including the vast amounts of money laundered through the UK, he adds. Huge amounts of money are lost every year through illegal tax evasion, money laundering and bribery. The people most at risk from this scourge are the worlds poorest, who lose out on education, healthcare and infrastructure  not to mention the impact of petty corruption on their daily lives. A spokesperson for DfID said: The UK is a global leader in the fight against corruption, and this report rightly recognises the governments summit in May as a significant moment in international efforts to tackle corruption.  Helping the worlds poorest stand on their own two feet by tackling poverty overseas while stopping organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion is firmly in the UKs interests. The UK is fully committed to delivering on the promises made at the anti-corruption summit.",

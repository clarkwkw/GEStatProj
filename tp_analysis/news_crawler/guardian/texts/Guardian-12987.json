    "text": "Fiona Kirton (Letters, 22 February) is right that the availability of parental support has a huge impact on access to post-compulsory education. Our research project Pound in Your Pocket into the finances of 14,000 students found that over half received support from their family for costs ranging from accommodation and transport to groceries. Those whose families are unable to support them are much more likely to report financial factors in considering discontinuing their studies and more than half of those who receive no family support worry about not being able to meet basic expenses such as rent and utility bills. Meanwhile, the cost of student accommodation has doubled in the past decade after inflation-busting rent increases. All this means that, if students are unable to return home for the holidays due to parents having to downsize their own housing, the cost implications of the government&apos;s austerity agenda and the bedroom tax are likely to be even more severe than Fiona suggests.Liam BurnsPresident, NUS  Build, build, build, Polly Toynbee tells Labour (19 February). At the bottom of my street is a large site with an office building and scruffy coach park that has been derelict for 30 years. The Stokes Croft community and the planners want affordable housing there. If the government and our enlightened new (independent) mayor adopted a land value tax, the owner would have to pay a commercial rate, so he would probably be forced either build to the planners&apos; requirements or sell for others to do so. All over the country are similar derelict sites. The policy would enable planners to see thousands of affordable houses built without their councils paying a penny.James BrugesBristol",

    "text": "The irony could hardly be richer. Big Pit, Wales&apos;s national coal museum and a vivid, living reminder of the country&apos;s most famous heavy industry, has announced the installation of 200 solar panels. About 6% of the museum&apos;s energy will be generated thanks to the photovoltaic panels set up on the roof of its main museum building in Blaenafon, south Wales. Eyebrows have been raised among some of the former miners who now lead visitors on underground tours of the mine, but the consensus is that this sign of the times is good for the museum, good for the environment and an emblem of Wales&apos;s determination to become a world leader in green energy. Peter Walker, the museum manager at Big Pit, said: &quot;Coal is such an important part of Wales&apos;s heritage, and yet green energy will play a major part in its future. A solar-powered coal mining museum is a fantastic way to celebrate this national journey.&quot; But there is also a practical side to it. &quot;It&apos;s far from just symbolic  the museum will benefit from huge reductions in energy bills,&quot; said Walker. Any surplus energy would be fed into the national grid  though as the museum opens throughout the year, there is unlikely to be much left over. Craig Anderson, projects director at the community interest company Warm Wales (Cymru Gynnes), who project-managed the scheme, said he was delighted that the thousands of children who visit the award-winning museum every year, would get an insight into the part that Welsh coal played in the industrial development of the world, but also see how new technology could replace the reliance on fossil fuels. &quot;It&apos;s a nice contrast between our industrial heritage and our desire now to harness renewable energy. I think it all makes perfect sense.&quot; Anderson said he hoped the museum would continue to invest in green technology. Mark Richards, deputy director general of Amgueddfa Cymru  National Museum Wales  said: &quot;As a working coal mine we are here to celebrate one of the world&apos;s oldest energy sources and an enormously important aspect of Welsh heritage. But it is important to look to, and plan for, the future  which is why we are delighted to be generating green electricity here at Big Pit. The new solar PV systems will help us cut both our bills and our carbon footprint, allowing us to reinvest the savings and earnings back into the museum.&quot;",

    "text": "PlayStation Vita&apos;s games library expands with two niche yet addictive digital releases hitting the PSN storefront. Orgarhythm (Xseed Games, 11.99) puts you in control of the God of Light, leading elemental warriors into battle. Gameplay blends rhythm action with real-time strategy to inspired effect, tapping out commands for your squad in time with the music. With each level no longer than a three-five-minute song, it&apos;s perfect for short bursts of portable gaming. However, the tiny top-down visuals and oft-demanding tempo may frustrate. Those seeking something a touch more sedate may prefer Dokuro (Gungho Online, 11.99). Controlling the eponymous hero, a trod-upon skeletal underling of the Dark Lord, players must guide a kidnapped princess out of the underworld. To navigate the perils ahead, Dokuro can drink a potion, turning into a handsome prince to fight monsters or carry the princess out of harm&apos;s way  poetically, tragically, the only time she notices him  or use magic chalk (and the Vita&apos;s touchscreen) to draw directly into the game world. Each stage segues seamlessly into the next, creating a lengthy and charming tale of escape, with enough hidden treasures toensure replay appeal. Puzzle platforming at its finest, all presented in a beautiful gothic storybook style.",

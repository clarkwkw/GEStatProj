    "text": "The Queen&apos;s diamond jubilee has been marked by a new Google Doodle featuring her silhouette, two diamonds in place of the &apos;O&apos;s&apos; from the tech company&apos;s name and two of her beloved corgies. A gold-bordered blue robe with a diamond pattern flows from the silhouette, which is reminiscent of postage stamps, while the &apos;E&apos; from Google sits on top of her crown. Events staged in tribute to the Queen&apos;s 60-year reign will be held across the UK during the extended four-day bank holiday, with spectacular public activities planned for the capital. The Royal Navy warship HMS Diamond signalled the start of the festivities in dramatic fashion by firing a 21-gun salute that boomed across Portsmouth harbour. The Queen starts her celebrations in earnest on Saturday with her traditional visit to the Epsom Derby to watch the thoroughbreds race. Preparations for a spectacular diamond jubilee river pageant on Sunday are also in place with up to a million people expected to line the banks of the River Thames and nearby open spaces to watch a 1,000-strong flotilla sail down the Thames, led by a royal barge. A special musical tribute to the Queen  diamond jubilee concert  will take place on Monday night, with pop veterans Madness performing on the roof of Buckingham Palace. A St Paul&apos;s Cathedral service of thanksgiving will be the highlight of Tuesday, ending with the Queen appearing on Buckingham Palace&apos;s balcony to acknowledge the tens of thousands expected to fill The Mall.",

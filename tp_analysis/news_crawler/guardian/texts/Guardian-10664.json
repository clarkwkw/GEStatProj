    "text": "Campaigners threatened to sue the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday in an effort to push Barack Obama to make good on his re-election promise to act on climate change. The formal notice calls on the EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson, to take immediate steps to begin regulating carbon emissions from cars, planes and off-road vehicles. It was the first attempt by campaigners since Obama&apos;s re-election to compel the agency to use its powers to act on climate change. And, once again, it puts the EPA at the centre of the political struggle over climate. Obama is under growing pressure to take the lead on the environment, after ranking the issue among the top three challenges facing the country following his re-election. &quot;Obviously it&apos;s clear that we need to keep moving on climate change,&quot; said Michael Livermore, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity, which is threatening the lawsuit. &quot;Hurricane Sandy and the discussion in the media in its aftermath raised the profile of the issue and delivered a stark reminder that climate change is not going away  the political dynamics of the US Congress not withstanding.&quot; Environmental groups have long complained that the agency was dragging out the process of setting rules on carbon. The EPA faces a number of other suits from environmental groups trying to push it into action. But the agency faces far greater legal pressure from opponents of climate action  including the states of Texas and Virginia, and industry groups  all trying to block the agency from regulating power plants and cars. A federal appeals court dismissed the industry law suits in June. But industry groups are continuing to put pressure on the EPA. The main oil industry group, the American Petroleum Institute, filed its own lawsuit against the EPA this week, seeking to overturn rules requiring petrol stations to add in biodiesel at the pump. Amid such pressure, Livermore argued the EPA sometimes needed a push in the opposite direction. &quot;A suit like this is really made to prod the agency in right direction,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes the EPA really does need a little kick.&quot; The institute originally pressed EPA to regulate car and plane emissions in 2009. &quot;More than three years have passed,&quot; the formal notice to Jackson said on Wednesday. The notice said the EPA had a legal obligation to enforce the Clean Air Act. &quot;Given the clear link between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, EPA&apos;s delay in acting and in responding to Policy Integrity&apos;s petition is inconsistent with the agency&apos;s legal requirements and scientific determinations,&quot; it said.",

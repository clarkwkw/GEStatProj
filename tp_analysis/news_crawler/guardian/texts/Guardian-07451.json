    "text": "As we head east from Benham Marsh towards Newbury, the Kennet and Avon canal is wide, still and greenish, a contrast to the interwoven, swift-flowing and braided river Kennet. Cycles zip up and down the towpath where once the heavy horses plodded, hauling barges. Between the towpath, the canal to the south and a strand of the river to the north, stand tall clumps of hemp agrimony with abundant, fluffy pink flowers. There are also the greenish-white flower-heads of hogweed and angelica, the first with an umbrella-shaped flower cluster, the angelica with a rounded umbel made of marble-sized balls of flowers. Surveying flower-heads is a window into insect life and Eristalis droneflies abound: doubtless the aquatic larvae have flourished in the wet summer. Also present are many honey bees, helped through cold, wet periods when foraging was impossible, by their honey stores and attendant keepers. There are scattered bumblebees, but thin on the ground. The usually huge variety ofother nectaring insects, from flies andparasitic wasps to beetles, is unusually sparse. Butterflies are having an annus horribilis, absent other than a few meadow browns and transient whites. The highlight is the musk beetle: dark, thin, an inch long with cumbersome antennae and a splendid body with a glittering green and bronze metallic sheen. The canal is edged with glorious, chest-high clumps of sedge; tussock and spikes of purple loosestrife, through which flit banded demoiselles, the sun reflecting electric blue from their broad wings and twiggy bodies. We get to the noisy A34 Newbury bypass that straddles the canal and turn into the setting sun, enjoying the backlit mayflies swirling back and forth on the surface of the water.",

    "text": "The first thing to do is to realise that there is no quick fix. We need to take a step back to go forward. It is tempting to see the 50-month countdown as a race against time, and the only way to win it is to run as fast as possible. The trouble is that we are paying no attention to the finishing tape, which gets inexorably further and further away. Someone else is writing the rules that govern the rules of the race, and we need to get control of the rule book. So many of the decisions that determine the rate at which the climate clock ticks are taken well beyond democratic control  in the boardrooms of energy companies and in the banks, which have done so much to bring half the world to the brink of financial ruin. It is no coincidence that the sense of powerlessness over climate change has coincided with an attack on the state, combined with an overweaning influence of the market and profit on social and political life. Money must be brought back under democratic control, and control of the state must be wrested from those whose interest lies in diminishing its democratic potential for reining in the market and acting in the common interest. The changes that have so severely blunted the political and cultural instruments for confronting the climate crisis have been 40 years in the making, and may take half as long again to put right. But better that than spend the next 20 years wasting time on short-term, small-scale gestures that play into the hands of business-as-usual by giving people the sense that &quot;something is being done&quot;. Political and cultural reconstruction takes time and we are starting almost from scratch. We have been deprived of the language we need  above all the idea that there is a common good beyond the unco-ordinated actions of millions of self-interested individuals. And collective action in the common good is stymied at every turn by markets and their agents  the credit ratings agencies  that exert such a malign and self-serving influence on our political and economic panorama. What does this have to do with climate change? Everything. We need to discard the ideological trappings of an increasingly discredited neo-liberalism  such as the fetish of consumer choice, or the notion of the small state. The financial tsunami that has caused bankers to fear, depositors to panic, and governments to act reflect an economic system that plays with our future as if it were a number on a roulette wheel. An active eco-state will never be the whole answer to the epic challenge of climate change, but it surely forms a big part of it.  Andrew Dobson is a professor of politics at Keele University",

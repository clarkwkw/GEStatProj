    "text": "The nationwide protests in Turkey started with the story of the people who lay down in front of the bulldozers to resist the destruction of our open spaces, the drying of the streams and the felling of the forests. The pressure on the country&apos;s environment and people, which began a decade ago under the slogan of &quot;urban transformation&quot;, has increased in recent months with a string of new environmentally destructive laws and regulations. When people protested against the building of hydroelectric and coal power plants there was no media attention, nor did it constitute a popular movement. Yet the seeds of today&apos;s resistance were planted in Bergama, Hopa, Munzur, Gerze, and Amasra. The laws to protect the environment from unchecked construction and development have been systematically undermined in order to allow grand government-favoured projects to go ahead without effective controls or regulation, and with no regard for human and environmental considerations. Compulsory &quot;environmental impact assessments&quot; for new projects have had their rules changed so decisions are far more likely to favour the investor. Forest laws have been transformed. The law known here as &quot;2B&quot; redefined some forests as &quot;not forests&quot; allowing them to be felled and turned to construction sites. Recently the government added the category of &quot;forests that won&apos;t benefit from protection&quot;. This change, along with the policy of &quot;urban transformation&quot; fuelled a period of seemingly uncontrolled construction across Turkey. In an Orwellian masterstroke the government has recently put to parliament a new law &quot;on the protection of nature and biological diversity.&quot; The draft bill would open the way to almost unrestricted exploitation of our natural environment. Twenty years ago a popular protest against a new gold mine turned into a call for local democratic rights. For years protesters against hydroelectric and coal projects along the Black Sea coast have faced similar intimidation to that seen today. Two years ago protesters at a coal plant were attacked for 12 hours by police with tear gas, pepper gas and water cannons. Today that gas has come to the heart of the republic and Gezi Park in Taksim, Istanbul. What we are hearing today is the voice of a people whose struggle has been ignored for a decade. It is born from years of past conflict in defence of the belief that nature and human rights are essential to life. A movement that started peacefully to defend the only remaining green space in the heart of Istanbul was met with riot police and tear gas. It was a protest in defence of article 56 of the Turkish constitution which states that we are entitled to live in a healthy and balanced environment and that it is the duty of the state and its citizens to ensure that our environment remains healthy and clean. That is why we gathered in Gezi Park on 27 May in order to protect the last remaining green space in our district. This is a struggle for rights which was started by hundreds and now encompasses millions. Its legitimacy comes not from any political viewpoint, or from Twitter, but from the shared moral value attached to our environment. Today sees the formation of a popular movement in support of the environment and rights. This movement is made out of people of all ages seeking their rights without any ideological guidance whatsoever. Decision makers ought to take into consideration the wishes for change and concerns expressed legitimately and with large popular support.  Pinar Aksogan works for Greenpeace Turkey.

    "headline": "Can Nate Silver's example save political journalism?", 
    "text": "In 2010 the New York Times did something quite remarkable: they licensed a statistician&apos;s blog, and asked him and his co-writers at FiveThirtyEight to provide non-partisan, evidence-based, statistical analysis of the race for the White House. It turned out to be an inspired decision: in the days before Obama&apos;s 2012 triumph, Silver and co.&apos;s math-laden posts were accounting for up to 20% of the traffic to one of the biggest newspaper websites in the world. To the carefully-ignorant world of political punditry, Nate Silver is a one-man zombie apocalypse. Someone on the internet once wrote: &quot;Zombies are scary because they are relentless and fearless. They don&apos;t feel pain, they can&apos;t be reasoned with. They never get tired. No matter how fast you run, in the end the plodding zombie will win the race.&quot;  Replace &apos;zombies&apos; with &apos;Nate Silver&apos;s numbers&apos; and you have a pretty accurate description of the last few months in the political bubble. Pundits clung stubbornly to the easy and convenient narrative that the race for the White House was on a knife edge; that the candidates were neck-and-neck. It helped that it was clearly in their interests to do so: Democrats played up the closeness of the race to get supporters to turn out, Republicans did the same, and the exaggerated excitements boosted ratings for everybody. Add a culture of statistical illiteracy to the mix, and it would be hard to create a less qualified group of people to inform the public if you tried. They wailed and cried as the numbers lurched slowly but steadily toward them, but ultimately they were overtaken and defeated with ease. No brains were eaten though.  The embarrassing truth is that there was nothing remarkable about Nate Silver&apos;s model, as the man himself freely admitted. He understood that the swing states are the ones that matter, he had a good understanding of the reliability of the sophisticated polling operations in those states, and he could see that when the polls were aggregated the public consistently favoured Obama. None of this was rocket science, yet to political commentators and their &apos;conventional wisdom&apos; it was as alien as witchcraft.  Leading the anti-reality charge in the UK were the Telegraph&apos;s Tim Stanley and Janet Daley. On November 5th, Stanley could be found patiently explaining that Mitt had the X-Factor, as polls showed even Florida slipping from the Republican&apos;s grasp. His &apos;methodology&apos; relied on cherry-picking three polls out of the hundreds available, all put in the field by Republican supporters, while misunderstanding a Pew study by apparently assuming it failed to account for likely voters. Janey Daley failed to meet even this standard a day later, declaring &quot;I believe Mitt Romney will win tonight&quot; on the basis that &quot;Obama&apos;s campaign does not look or feel like it is winning  and Mitt Romney&apos;s does.&quot; That this is considered an acceptable standard for a broadsheet newspaper columnist speaks volumes. In fairness to British pundits, our polling simply isn&apos;t good enough to support a Five Thirty Eight of our own: Nate Silver&apos;s preternatural success owed a great deal to the accuracy of extensive daily polling by multiple organisations in several swing states. In the UK, the Conservative Party&apos;s &apos;40 Group&apos;  the forty MPs holding the most marginal constituencies  have no equivalent information to draw on. Still, the information from national polls ought to be enough for political pundits to say something intelligent... surely? Apparently not. One of the most tedious narratives in recent months has been the idea that UKIP might overtake the Liberal Democrats to become Britain&apos;s 3rd party; an analysis which falls apart as soon as you ask basic questions, like &quot;which constituencies will they win?&quot; or &quot;what percentage of people would vote for them?&quot; The dull reality is that the Lib Dems have been flat at around 10% for yonks, while telephone polls rarely see the UKIP squeak over 5%. Even if they were level in the polls, political geography makes it very unlikely that UKIP would gain a seat - in their top target, Buckingham, Farage trailed John Bercow by almost thirty percentage points. The perception that UKIP and the Lib Dems are close is simply a myth, and has come about largely through reporting bias, as UK Polling Report explained recently:   &quot;polling companies that show UKIP in third or challenging for third tend to include them in their topline figures. Polling companies that have them in a distant fourth don&apos;t really bother. This is understandable enough, but means the good figures get far more prominence than the bad ones (it is further exacerbated by the reporting of polls  UKIP in third place is a news story worth reporting).&quot;  This may shock you, but opinion polls are actually really boring. The UK Polling Report aggregates information from all polls, and you can see a graph of voter intention (roughly: who would you vote for if an election were held today) on their website. By the end of 2011, the Coalition honeymoon had come to an end, with the Tories and Lib Dems declining to around 35% and 10%, and Labour establishing a solid mid-term lead in the low-40s. It&apos;s been more-or-less the same ever since, with the exception of a blip at the start of 2012 when the Tories briefly closed the gap before falling back slightly further to the low-30s. This may be the least interesting paragraph I&apos;ve ever written, but to see this dull reality reimagined by the press you&apos;d think Cameron and Miliband were carving chunks of flesh out of each other with pick-axes, battling to the death in a vat of political custard. The central premise of the book Moneyball was the idea that &quot;the collected wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the front office) over the past century is subjective and often flawed.&quot; In taking an evidence-based, analytical approach to data, the Oakland Athletics baseball team were famously able to embarrass their richer, traditional-minded competitors, and ultimately trigger a revolution in the game.  It&apos;s easy to see the parallels with political journalism, a culture living in an unhealthy bubble where politicians and journalists are rarely challenged in any meaningful way, and where evidence and science are treated with suspicion by those who prefer to rely on some intangible sense of their own expertise. The most important difference is that while poor performance in baseball is ruthlessly punished, poor political journalism encouraged by a culture in which editors aim to tell people what they want to hear, and audiences are increasingly free to choose the reality that best fits their world-view.  Nate Silver&apos;s greatest achievement has been to prick that bubble, but in spite of his success, he has not yet demonstrated that reality is popular - the real test will be whether liberals still visit in their millions when his model swings against them. Whether evidence-based punditry can have a lasting impact depends whether readers and viewers will ultimately choose to reject the misinformation, or the reality. @mjrobbins",

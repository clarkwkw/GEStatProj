    "text": "Who doesn&apos;t love skimming stones? Standing on the side of a tranquil expanse of water, launching a perfectly weighted projectile and watching it hop from point to point before disappearing beneath the surface. Indeed it&apos;s a surprise that it&apos;s taken an app developer so long to latch on to the idea but developers Halfbrick (of David Cameron-favourite Fruit Ninja fame) have added a pescetarian flavour in Fish Out of Water! (iOS, 69p). The aim is to throw three fish out on to the ocean, before being judged in marks out of 10  based on number of bounces and distance travelled  by a trio of expert crustaceans. Depth is provided by a choice of six marine animals to skim, including a hefty whale and a dolphin. These all have different strengths and weaknesses, suited to different angles of attack and specific weather conditions, as the climate changes from hour to hour, varying the experience. Goals are set, such as travelling a set distance with a specific fish. When three goals are completed players level-up, providing bonus gems to aid progress. These jewels unlock further add-ons to boost the score. With online leaderboards to test yourself against friends, Halfbrick have delivered another addictive slice of portable gaming.",

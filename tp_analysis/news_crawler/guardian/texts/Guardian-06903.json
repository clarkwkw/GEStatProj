    "text": "Suffer one too many snakebites and your character will die. A venomous spider drops on you and death ensues. Fall down a hole from too great a height, the same. Misjudge a leap over a deadly set of spikes and well, you get the picture. Yet despite the often brutal difficulty curve, indie game Spelunky somehow avoids being infuriating and instead positions itself as one of the finest action platformers around. Armed only with a trusty whip, players descend into an ever-changing labyrinth of subterranean locales, hoarding treasure and rescuing damsels while tackling or avoiding an endless stream of lethal obstacles  and you will die. A lot. Perhaps it&apos;s Spelunky&apos;s cutesy aesthetic that alleviates frustration or its wry sense of humour  visual gags aplenty, with more than a few aimed at a certain cinematic academic-cum-archeologist  but either way, you&apos;ll succumb to its siren call of &quot;one more go&quot; well into the early hours of the morning; each small progression will feel like an accomplishment well earned. Upgraded from the PC version of a few years prior, this Xbox digital download also boasts a Bomberman-style multiplayer survival mode and massively enhanced graphics. Easily the most addictive indie game available.",

    "text": "Games out this week include iPhone classic, Jetpack Joyride (PS3) retooled for play on a bigger screen; Outdoors Unleashed: Africa 3D (3DS), which has you shooting up the Serengeti&apos;s wildlife in a non-stop safari of death. Far more excitingly, Ace Of Spades (PC) brings guns and ammunition to a Minecraft-style world, so you and your team can build, maintain and extend a fortress as you exchange pixelated pot shots with the enemy. The other new content out this week is Halo 4: Spartan Ops Episode Five, the latest instalment of Halo 4&apos;s weekly heavily-armed soap opera, which sees you leading teams of Spartans in assaults against the Prometheans. It contains a neat plot twist, effectively reframing some of the events of the campaign, and offers a nice fresh challenge for those still getting back in touch with their inner genetically altered super soldier.",

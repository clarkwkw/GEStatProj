    "text": "What&apos;s your favourite piece of technology, and how has it improved your life?Any computer that can play illegal streams of football matches. I love the iPad, but they&apos;ve got to get over their problem with Flash so that I can continue to watch football games illegally while on tour. When was the last time you used it, and what for?I watched Arsenal being beaten 4-0 by Milan in a hotel in Disney World, via a website I know. It was not the happiest place on Earth, that particular afternoon. Is there any particular piece of technology that you have owned and hated?No, I can&apos;t think of one. If you had one tip about getting the best out of new technology, what would it be?Buy every second generation. Do you consider yourself to be a luddite or a nerd?I&apos;m a nerd  phenomenally nerdy. But then, that&apos;s such a badge of honour these days. What&apos;s the most expensive piece of technology you&apos;ve ever owned?Probably a desktop  it used to be a couple of grand for a computer. God bless Moore&apos;s Law. What is your favourite gaming system, and why?The Xbox, just for its versatility  but the PS3 probably has a bit more oomph. And the HD is better on the PS3. I&apos;m in the luxurious position of having them all. What game are you currently playing?Batman: Arkham City. But it should be presumed that at any stage I&apos;m playing all of them, because I haven&apos;t finished anything. I got to the end of Dead Space, and I will do with Batman, but I only finish one or two a year. I do like the blockbuster games. Do you still buy physical media such as CDs and DVDs, or do you download?I don&apos;t download games. With movies, I&apos;m moving more toward Netflix and Sky Go. New music I gave up on ages ago  I&apos;m all about Spotify. So if Netflix turns into Spotify, that will be the end of DVD. Robot butlers  a good idea or not? Can they do stairs? Can they get into corners? Children will fulfill many of the same functions. And I&apos;m yet to meet a robot who can fix a daiquiri as well as a small child can. What piece of technology would you most like to own? The best invention ever would be a straight to bed button  where, if you push it, you end up snuggled up in bed. You wouldn&apos;t have to negotiate the travel home, or anything. I&apos;d pay any amount of money for that.  Dara O&apos;Briain will host the 2012 Bafta Video Game Awards on 16 March",

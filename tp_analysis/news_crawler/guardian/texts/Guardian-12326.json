    "text": "The formatting of these opening paragraphs sucks It may seem random and confusing as your eyes adjusta little  and you pick out the bold text. Yes it&apos;s a bitweird. And sadly these lines are all the wrong width, brokenand probably incoherent on a mobile screen. I&apos;m compressing all the meaning into the top lines and down my pants. Sorry, that was childish. I mean downthe sides - particularly on the left, where the time stampsusually go for the 80% of Guardian big pants postswith a  traffic-grabbing live blog on them. There&apos;s also bit more at the bottom.  Don&apos;t like it? Well tough - this wasn&apos;t my idea. Ohno. This, travesty of a mobile-app breaking blog post dear reader, and the billion angry comments I&apos;ll get about it,  is your fault . Nothing to do with me. This is how you read.And it&apos;s stupid. For writers, this rude behaviour is infuriating. I want to write enjoyable, rich, wordy pieces, but youbutcher them with your distracted, tired eyes. Even children seem to have better attention spans than you do. It feels as if any attempts at decent writing are doomed. Eye-tracking studies have revealed that people don&apos;tactually have eyes, we just assumed they did. For similar factssimply read from the hard-right wiki &apos;Conservapedia&apos; frombeginning to end. Today I learned Muslims don&apos;t run straight,but follow a distinctive F-shaped pattern.     Eye-tracking heat-maps show how a reader's attention wanders over the page. By Nielsen Norman Group.    On average, it seems people only read about 20% of the words on the title screens of TOWIE and readinga page would be too much for the sort of degeneratemind that can watch ITV2 for any sustained period of time; spending hours watching tedious, numbing shows withonly 4.4 seconds of actual, meaningful content broadcastper episode and a script of about 100 words.     Graph of reader attention spans, created by Jacob Nielsen of Nielsen Norman Group, based on data from Weinreich's paper. People spend 25 seconds on a page, plus an addition 4.4 seconds per 100 words.    This is especially bad when it comes to irony. DeanBurnett attempted a spoof CiF post on Israel to showthis yesterday but was restrained when editors realisedhis &apos;reveal&apos; was a giant antisemitic penis hidden belowthe line  in the seedy bowels of the content systemwhere only 20% of you go. Now many people believe, wrongly, that our Dean thinks Brian Cox is a useless presenter. That clearlyis a big fat lie, but in the angry realms of Twitter, spluttering readers have made up their minds on the basis of a fifth of the facts. The F-Pattern is an arse.  Twitter is the ultimate enemy of irony. Rattling through words at breakneck speed, people like torespond, and talk about their shitty breakfasts andrespond to celebrities even though they get no responses back and turn to mob justice and angerfaster than me at a buffet. Twitter&apos;s heat can be the nemesis of thought - hundreds of silly, agitated folk engaging in arguments that don&apos;t really exist. On Twitter, people can have strong opinions about articles of clothing worn by tacky celebs who go outwithout their pants on, ironically judging them withouthaving to bother putting their own pants on. Shrieking into the void, since nobody is reading them at all. The F-pattern unconsciously informed the development man, filling all this in is getting tedious of the crappy &apos;inverted  ever have an idea that seemed pyramid&apos;  really clever about two hours ago?approach to journalism. Who, why, what, where, and when are crammed at the top under this bland and tedious model, before the story the very first comment on this will be &quot;tl;dr&quot;Weirdly Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur peters out.  Interestingly, the inverted pyramid model evolved decades before we even discovered sex in 1962, orhad the ability to create porn for the first time on theInternet, let alone the first iPhone enabled genital and--eye-tracking &apos;cyber-romance&apos; technology. You can read a little more about the history and scienceof inverted pyramids - one of Egypt&apos;s less successful projects - and web reading, which Ancient Egyptians were shit at becausethey used Internet Explorer 4 and active desktop sucked.Here  is a link I can&apos;t be bothered summarizing and over here. But for now, think about how crappy this is to readand how smug and annoying and &apos;arty&apos; I am, and howcrappy it is that I get paid for this, and how easy this placemust be to write for. I&apos;d carry on, but after 50 long seconds, is anyone still there?Hello? Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur sit amet Anyone? adipiscing elit. Nulla fermentum massa nulla sem Hello?  Oh... you&apos;ve pissed off already, lured by a stray Facebook notification or an alluring news-related SEO term or an exclusive &apos;pic&apos; of a &apos;celeb&apos; showing off a well-turned-out pair of shins. Well I never really liked you much anyway. Run along back to Twitter where people type words in small enough quantities for your tiny little child-brain to cope with. I&apos;m off to play bloody Scrabble.  @mjrobbins",

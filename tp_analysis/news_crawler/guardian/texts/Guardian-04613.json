    "text": "Birds in the Amazon are under increasing threat from deforestation, while large populations of duck have disappeared from northern Europe, and vultures are under intensifying attack in Africa, according to the latest survey of the world&apos;s birds. The Rio Branco antbird has been singled out for particular concern  it lives in the Amazon, but its relatively long lifespan makes it more vulnerable than some other species to even moderate deforestation. The hoary-throated spinetail is predicted to lose more than 80% of its habitat in the same region, putting it on the &quot;critically endangered&quot; list, meaning the species faces serious risk of extinction. According to BirdLife International&apos;s update for 2012 of the IUCN red list of threatened species, close to 100 species of birds across the Amazon region are now at a greatly increased threat of extinction. &quot;We have previously underestimated the risk of extinction that many of Amazonia&apos;s bird species are facing,&quot; said Leon Bennun, director of science, policy and information at BirdLife. &quot;However, given the recent weakening of Brazilian forest law, the situation may be even worse than recent studies have predicted.&quot; In Africa, the white-backed and Rueppell&apos;s vultures have been classified as &quot;endangered&quot;, after their numbers have decline rapidly. Vultures have been suffering across the globe, particularly in areas such as India and south-east Asia, because of poisoning from pesticides, loss of habitat and harassment from farmers. The decline in their numbers has raised fears for the future of other species, as vultures play a key role in the food chain by feeding on dead animals. But this year&apos;s list  based on a review that takes place every four years  shows that it is not just tropical species that are facing serious threats. In northern Europe, more than one million long-tailed ducks have mysteriously disappeared from the Baltic region over the past two decades. No one is sure why this has happened, and the species is now classified as &quot;vulnerable&quot;, while another northern European sea duck, the Velvet Scoter, has been listed as &quot;endangered&quot;. BirdLife called for conservation efforts to be increased, as birds across the globe face mounting threats from habitat loss, hunting and predation, pollution, and other environmental problems. Stuart Butchart, global research coordinator for BirdLife, pointed to the success of some conservation programmes as a guide to future efforts to ensure the survival of some of the world&apos;s rarest species. For instance, in the Pacific, the Raratonga Monarch of the Cook Islands has returned from the brink of extinction, owing to a concerted attempt to control predators such as black rats, which are not native to the islands and the proliferation of which created havoc for nesting birds. In Brazil, the restinga antwren, which lives in the coastal south-east of the country, has been found to be more widespread than previously thought, while a new protected area covering some of its key habitat should help to ensure its long term survival. Butchart said: &quot;Such successes show the remarkable achievements that are possible where effort and dedication by conservationists and local communities are backed up with political support and adequate resources.&quot; But he said more efforts were needed, and on a wider scale, to ensure more species stay off the critically endangered list.",

    "text": "The big banks just don&apos;t get it do they? Not content with causing the near-collapse of the global financial system and triggering a recession, many of these banks are still arrogantly rewarding their staff with obscenely bloated bonuses. The good news is that there is an alternative to unethical banks. Ethical Consumer magazine&apos;s banking report, published this week, includes comprehensive buyers&apos; guides to ethical personal banking including current and savings accounts, cash Isas and mortgages. With more than 340 branches, leading the charge for ethical current accounts on the high street is the Co-operative Bank and Smile, its online banking arm. The Co-op has been setting the agenda for a more sustainable and responsible form of banking since it launched its customer-led ethical stance in 1992. This bars the Co-op from lending to companies involved in a range of activities from the arms trade and animal testing to genetic engineering and global warming. Building societies including Nationwide, Coventry, and Cumberland are another option to consider for a more ethical current account. They are judged to be ethical by virtue of the fact that strict regulations limit the amount of money building societies can invest in certain industries. The other plus point is that building societies profits are ploughed back into the business for the benefit of borrowers and savers rather than shareholders. The other option for ethically minded consumers are credit unions. With more than 400 now active across the UK, credit unions are run as financial co-operatives owned and run by their members helping those on low-incomes get affordable credit and 25 credit unions presently offer current accounts. Savers can now also benefit from a range of specialist ethical alternatives for both savings accounts and cash Isas. Launched 10 years ago, Charity Bank is the UK&apos;s only bank which is also a registered charity. It only lends to charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises and so is ideal for savers who want to use their money to support a bank whose ethos focuses on generating social and not just financial profit. Triodos Bank offers ethically themed savings accounts and cash Isas and only lends to businesses and organisations that promote or provide long-term positive change. For example their saver account links your savings with groups involved with fair trade, organic food production and renewable energy. Another option for savers are the UK&apos;s 57 building societies which are all judged in the report to be an ethical best-buy for savings accounts. On the face of it, the only specialist ethical mortgage on offer is that provided by the Ecology Building Society which also offers savings accounts and cash Isas. The West Yorkshire-based Ecology only lends on properties that have a clear environmental benefit such as renovating a derelict or run-down property, , borrowers looking to fit energy-saving kit or surprisingly, people looking for mortgages for back-to-back terraces which are by design highly energy efficient. However, good ethical alternatives for mortgages exist in the form of those offered by any of the 57 building societies referred to earlier as well as those offered by the Co-op Bank and the Co-op owned Britannia Building Society. Our report comes alongside the launch of the Move Your Money campaign, which is encouraging people to move their accounts from the failed and disgraced big banks to more ethical alternatives. Supported by a coalition of groups including Co-operatives UK, us, and the New Economics Foundation, we want to get people to move their accounts by the end of March. Friday has seen Move your Money actions take place in both Leeds and London where people have queued outside Barclays to close their accounts with the bank that has just announced pre-tax profits of 5.9bn and a total bonus pool of 2.9bn. With neither the banking sector nor the regulatory authorities or government showing any interest in overhauling the current flawed banking system it&apos;s clear that it&apos;s up to us as consumers to do something about it ourselves. Now it&apos;s over to you.  Simon Birch writes for Ethical Consumer  Read the Money section in Saturday&apos;s Guardian for more on the Move your Money campaign",

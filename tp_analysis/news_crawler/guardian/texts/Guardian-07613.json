    "headline": "My antidote to celebrities who promote homeopathy", 
    "text": "The sad fact is, when it comes to science, you can have as much data to support your claim as you like, you can have it rigorously tested, repeated, peer-reviewed, published, referenced copiously and awarded a Nobel prize, you can do all this, but if a competing theory has any element of celebrity endorsement, that&apos;s the one most people are going to hear about. Even if it&apos;s scientifically ludicrous. Actually, especially if it&apos;s scientifically ludicrous. Just look at Power Balance wrist bands. Celebrities promoting dubious science and scientists getting annoyed about it are nothing new. I guess this is understandable to a certain extent when you consider the sort of lives celebrities must lead, which must distort your world view somewhat. This is probably doubly true for famous actors, as their job is basically pretending that fictional worlds are real. That&apos;s got to rub off on you at some point. But it&apos;s a depressingly common tactic for those who benefit from promoting or selling things contradicted by science to cite the supportive famous person as a substitute for genuine evidence. The latest example of this is a gushing puff-piece in the Mirror about celebrities who use homeopathy.  For those not yet familiar with homeopathy, it&apos;s essentially a form of alternative medicine that argues that if you are suffering from an illness, then you take a substance that is known to cause the same symptoms as the illness or malady (eg if you have insomnia, use caffeine), dilute this substance down to the point where there&apos;s none of it left in the water, then shake that water or slap it with a leather book (depends on who you ask, it seems), then sprinkle drops of the shaken/slapped water onto sugar pills and sell it to the general public as medicine. Thing is, I&apos;m not even slightly exaggerating for comic effect, that&apos;s how homeopathy supposedly works. This isn&apos;t mentioned anywhere in the celebrity article mentioned above, which I think is very telling. It does claim that &quot;more than 10 million people in the UK&quot; swear by it though. That&apos;s around 15% of the entire UK population. Can that be right? I&apos;ve never met anyone who swears by it in my 30 years. I&apos;ve known plenty who swear about it though, are they counting them as part of that number? I&apos;m not going to devote an article to criticising homeopathy, there are plenty of people who can do that better. There are plenty of people who argue in favour of homeopathy, for numerous reasons, but it seems to be running into a lot of adversity these days, and it would be easy to interpret this latest media outburst as an attempt to boost support. I&apos;ve been known to make fun of homeopathy before now, so obviously I&apos;m not impartial. But in all seriousness, people are influenced by celebrity endorsements, and if this leads to choices that could negatively affect people&apos;s health, that&apos;s not good at all. Ergo, I feel duty bound to present an antidote for these potentially damaging celebrity testimonials. Homeopathy argues that like cures like, but science states that for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. So what would be an equal-but-opposite reaction to an article which is essentially real celebrities endorsing a fictional medicine? Obviously, it would be endorsements of real medicine. From fictional celebrities. So, without further ado  Darth Vader, Sith Lord and father, 48 (maybe) The health of what remains of my body is one of my top priorities, and I ensure this via any and all means necessary, from a suite of personal technological apparatus to regular sessions in my life support pod.  Destroying planets on a whim and choking people without actually touching them would take its toll on anyone&apos;s body, let alone a particularly ravaged one like mine. Luckily, medical science has ensured that my life has been preserved, so that I can end many others.      Without inhalable steroids Darth Vader would be fighting for breath. Photograph: Allstar    As well as the life support system and prosthetic limbs, my suit also helps control more minor ailments. For example, my helmet dispenses inhalable steroids and beta agonists to help limit the effects of my obvious asthma, ensuring my booming voice can bring terror to whole star systems without an undermining wheeze. Some say traditional medicine is dangerous or a scam. I find their lack of faith disturbing. Sleeping Beauty, Princess, 116 (allegedly) When I was 16 years old, I accidentally cut my finger on an archaic sewing machine which someone had left lying around. The infection I got from this rusty device ended up triggering an autoimmune response which attacked the areas of my brain that produce hypocretin, which lead to me developing my pronounced and persistent narcolepsy.     It's not kisses from princes that keep Sleeping Beauty awake but narcolepsy medication. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Disney    My being a princess meant my parents explained this embarrassing illness in someone of royal blood via some elaborate propaganda about fairies and a worryingly non-consensual &quot;awakening&quot; by my arranged husband, but the truth is that medical science came to my aid and helped me deal with my condition. I now take regular dexamphetamine sulphate to alleviate the symptoms, and have a prescribed sleep regimen to help me cope better with the disorder. I am now a functional adult, thanks to medical science.  Admittedly, there is the possible side effect of hallucinations, but when you live in a fairy tale castle it&apos;s hard to tell whether that&apos;s happening or not. Edward Cullen, vampire and heartthrob, 111 As a vegetarian vampire trying to integrate into normal society while involved in a relationship with someone nearly a century my junior and being constantly harassed by surprisingly smooth werewolves, it would be fair to say that I experience a lot of stress. And as I&apos;m stuck in the body of a perpetually broody 17-year-old, stress often takes its toll on my skin. Being prone to acne for decades would be bad enough, but due to my bizarre physiology my acne is weirdly sparkly. After particularly difficult events, my skin breaks out and I look like I should be sold in Claire&apos;s Accessories, and this risks both my survival in human society and my fan base.     Teen heartthrob Edward Cullen uses antibacterial facewash to keep acne and werewolves at bay. Photograph: PR    However, thanks to an experienced and reassuringly discrete dermatologist, I can keep my skin under control. Regular washing and topical creams that contain active ingredients like benzoyl peroxide help reduce bacteria and clear dead skin (or in my case, deader skin). When these prove ineffectual in cases of severe acne, there are stronger medications like Roaccutane to help. The occult chaos in my life takes its toll on my perfect skin, but medical science is there to help preserve it. My doctor has also suggested iron tablets for my anaemia, but one thing at a time. Lara Croft, archaeologist and thief, 44 (apparently) As someone who essentially defiles ancient crypts in inaccessible locations for a living, my chosen profession involves a lot of acrobatics, such as somersaults, flips and long distance leaps. Regular activity of this sort would lead to tremendous physical stress on anyone&apos;s body. But when you have rather disproportionate breasts like mine, it meant even an greater strain on my neck and back. Thankfully, medical science has refined breast reduction surgery to the point where it is a relatively safe and common procedure, so I was able to reduce my breast size before I did some serious damage to myself and put a premature stop to my adventuring.     Cognitive behavioural therapy helped Lara Croft to chill. Photograph: PR    On the advice of friends, I am also undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy to help me deal with my psychological issues. My traumatic past has left me with a lot of anger and paranoia, which I used to express by gunning down endangered species, even going so far as killing things that were already extinct. Thanks to medicine and counselling, rare animals now have a greater chance of survival. Morbo the Annihilator, broadcaster, interviewer and warlord, age Unknown Puny human medicine will be useless when faced with the wrath of Morbo and his mighty brain. But Morbo&apos;s brain can prove even too mighty for Morbo. Morbo&apos;s brain risked swelling to such a size that Morbo&apos;s head could no longer contain it. Hoping to earn favour with their future conquerors, feeble human doctors fitted Morbo with a Cerebral Ventricular shunt, which eased Morbo&apos;s mighty head pressure and allowed him to go about his duties, gathering information to make the conquest of Earth by his people even easier. Although Morbo&apos;s life was clearly never at risk, Morbo is grateful to the pathetic human medics and will reward them with a mercifully quick death when their race is subjugated.  Morbo&apos;s celebrity colleagues originally suggested he try homepathy to ease his headaches.  WATER DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY!! GOODNIGHT! Pac Man, yellow circle, 32 I first found fame in the mid 1980s, and I&apos;m not too proud to admit it went straight to my head. I didn&apos;t know how to deal with the sudden wealth and popularity, and I just spiralled. As well as choking down so many pills that I was regularly seeing colourful ghosts, I was indulging in every sort of vice you can name. But eventually I hit rock bottom and had to seek help.  Thanks to medical science, there are a number of options for people like me. Counselling and sedatives for the pills addiction, Disulfiram for the alcoholism, and many other treatments that saved me from myself.     Evidence-based medicine came to the rescue of Pac Man when he was at his lowest ebb. Photograph: Sinibomb Images/Alamy    I was lucky enough to get my new job as an emoticon, which gave me another chance at life, but we&apos;re all lucky that medical science is there, and able to help people like me when we&apos;re at our lowest ebb. Maybe I can&apos;t waka waka like I used to, but at least I&apos;m alive to remember it. Sauron, Dark Lord and jeweller, 50,000+ Raising an army of pure evil to conquer all of Middle-earth is a demanding task, particularly when you&apos;re just an eye, albeit a giant fiery one. As my eye is all I&apos;ve got, I make sure it&apos;s well cared for by the best medicine available. This is doubly important when working with hot metals and other substances (as I do regularly), as you risk photokeratitis, so I always endeavour to perform these tasks in a safe manner (ie getting orcs to do it. I&apos;ve always got plenty of those). Being a flaming eye means I&apos;m prone to all manner of eye injuries and conditions, but medical science has created remedies for the majority of these, from antibiotics and creams, to a simple Optrex wash. All help to keep me a watchful and aware force of pure evil. Some minions in the past have suggested alternative medicine to me. They&apos;re all dead now. Using magic to heal ailments? Do I look like an elf? Aaaaand  cue furious comments",

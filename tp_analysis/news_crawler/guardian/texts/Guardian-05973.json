    "text": "   Fred Mwesige, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    My understanding of sustainable development is that it is all about access to basics needs. If I am able to have a daily income to enable me to get basic needs for my family, then to me, sustainable development has been attained. This is possible as long as there is good infrastructure to facilitate my business. As a dealer in agricultural produce such as beans, maize and rice there is nothing more important than being able to transport my produce to the market. I buy produce from the villages and sell it at a slightly higher price at urban centres. In the past 20 years, my country has been able to register tremendous changes both positively and negatively. From political instability, poor health service delivery, high inflation to stability, and improved communication technologies. I have also seen my life change. After dropping out of high school because I was unable to pay the fees, given the poverty levels in my family, I managed to work hard until I raised money that enabled me return to school, where I have been able to attain a diploma in business management. It is because of education that I am able to run my business. I have also been able to enjoy the benefits of new technology. My only worry lies in the delay in discovering an HIV/Aids cure. I am tempted to think that the western world seems to be benefiting from the scourge. My message to the Rio+20 summit is that they focus on devising strategies to eradicate diseases, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. By focusing on improving health, and addressing issues such as malaria and HIV/Aids, poverty levels could tremendously drop.",

    "text": "Bloomsbury is an area of west central London, incidentally not far from Guardian HQ. Famous for its academic and literary connections, Bloomsbury&apos;s notable history includes its role as the namesake of a group of early 20th century intellectuals, the Bloomsbury group, who met there. Bloomsbury&apos;s scientific heritage is perhaps less familiar. Modern-day scientific connections are immediately apparent: the imposing glass frontage of theWellcome Trustheadquarterson the Euston Road greets visitors to the area. Away from the railway station, the streets are peppered with buildings hosting University College London&apos;s laboratories, and the associated teaching hospital, University College Hospital, is close by. However, Bloomsbury&apos;s scientific connections are diverse and go back centuries. Walking along Gower Street, the observant can spot the plaque commemorating the home of Charles Darwin. More recently, the concept of the nuclear chain reaction was conceived on Bloomsbury&apos;s streets. The Wellcome Trust primarily funds biomedical research, but it takes its remit to support science outreach seriously. The trust funds projects that aim toengage the public in issues concerning science and its place in society. One such project,funded in part by the Trust, is coming to Bloomsbury on Saturday 20 October.            94elements is a film project that aims to tell human stories that consider our relationship with the elements that make up our world. The project was launched in May this year, and has already produced short films about both well-known elements and those that are less familiar. While 94elements engaged professional filmmakers, the spin-off projectMix-Labinvites contributors to combine elements into compounds and submit their own short films to the site. Local to Bloomsbury, OneKXis a centre for young people. The centre aims to offer opportunities to explore the arts, technology and science, and is funded by Central YMCA. Mixlab seemed like the perfect project for OneKX&apos;s remit, and this summer the centre sought a group of young people to make a short film to contribute. The project brings together young people with diverse backgrounds, from scientists to dancers and actors. The culmination of a month and a half&apos;s work is a pair of short film on Oxytocin that will premiere on Saturday 20 October at the Bloomsbury Festival. The Bloomsbury Festival presents the range of creative activity that takes place in the area, and encompasses science as well as dance, music and film. From mathematical buskingto taboo-busting in the animal kingdom (&quot;suitable for adults&quot;), the Bloomsbury Festival will capture the diversity of bright minds connected to these few streets of London, from the past to the present day. And if you miss out on the event itself, you can follow the progress of the 94 elements project at 94elements.com. With thanks to Matt Brown for help on the scientific history of Bloomsbury, and a declaration of interest: Ant Cule brought 94elements to my attention through his involvement with Mixlab.",

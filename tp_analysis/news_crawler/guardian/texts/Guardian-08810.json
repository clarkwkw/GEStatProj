    "text": "An entire generation of children could lose the cultural skills both they and the UK need if the government goes ahead with its English Baccalaureate plans without the arts as a core subject, the Tate director, Nicholas Serota, said on Thursday. Serota used the launch of his organisation&apos;s annual report to urge ministers to rethink their plans for the EBacc certificates, which will replace GCSEs. He said the arts should be a fourth &quot;R&quot; alongside reading, writing and arithmetic. &quot;The proposals do not provide for the arts as being one of the core subjects and the way in which the proposals have been formulated makes it very clear that art, design, music, drama and dance will be pushed to the margin with very little time in the curriculum for those subjects. &quot;We regard cultural learning as being more important than ever and we think that the arts have a primary role to play in a world that is dependent on literacy of all kinds, including visual.&quot; Serota said it was a more important matter than even the debate about public cuts to arts spending because it affected every child in the country and &quot;it is about the kind of society that we want to have in 20 years&apos; time&quot;. He added: &quot;There is a real risk that fewer and fewer schools will provide learning opportunities in the arts. The UK&apos;s leading edge in creativity may be lost. We cannot deprive an entire generation of children of the cultural skills that they will need.&quot; Serota is the latest of many to express concern at the proposals as they stand. Among the many voices Deborah Annetts, the chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians, said: &quot;It is as if the Olympics never happened. Design  gone, technology  gone, music  gone. This shortsighted, wholesale attack on secondary music education will emasculate not only our world class music education system but also our entire creative economy.&quot;  Earlier this year Darren Henley published a well received report into cultural learning after which the government said it would publish a national plan by early autumn. That plan is still awaited. Serota said: &quot;Everyone recognises there have been many things on the plate of the DCMS [Department for Culture, Media and Sport] over the summer of the Olympics, but we earnestly hope that the national plan will be published before Christmas.&quot; Tate&apos;s annual report highlighted some of its 516 acquisitions to the collection over the past year. They include works gifted by artists, such as Martin Creed giving a neon work with the words &quot;DON&apos;T WORRY&quot;, and works purchased, such as nearly 10 cubic metres of Ai Weiwei&apos;s sunflower seeds and 58 photographs by Lewis Baltz, which make up a series called San Quentin Point 1982. The chairman of trustees, Lord Browne, said Tate now got the majority of its funding, 61%, from private and not public sources. &quot;Over the past five years Tate has increased its self-generated income by 15%, compared to the 5% increase in grant-in-aid.&quot; It was also announced that it has raised three-quarters of the capital costs for its ongoing 215m extension while all the money was raised for the 45m Tate Britain redevelopment that will, among other things, allow the first floor to be opened to the public for the first time since 1928.",

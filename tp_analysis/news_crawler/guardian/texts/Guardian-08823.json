    "text": "     Millions of Android handsets including the Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy S2, HTC One X and HTC Desire can be wiped just by visiting a malicious website that embeds particular code in weblinks, security experts have warned. Update: HTC has issued a statement saying that &quot;our devices do not support a USSD code to factory reset option.&quot; This means that they should not be vulnerable to the exploit described below. A user with a vulnerable handset who visits a page and clicks a link containing the malicious code would see their phone wiped, losing personal data such as photos and texts as well as repleaceable data such as contact details and apps. The flaw is caused by a security hole in some versions of Android&apos;s dialler software, which allows the &quot;tel:&quot; URL prefix to be used on a webpage to perform functions on the phone&apos;s dialling software. Normally that is useful for functions such as initiating a call on the handset directly from a site. But the tel: prefix can also be used to pass a string of non-numeric data to the dialler.  Special strings of characters can perform other functions; for example typing #06# on the dialler will display a phone&apos;s IMEI number.  The flaw exploits a string that activates a factory reset of some phones because they do not force a user interaction before carrying out the function encoded in the string. The code would have to be embedded as a link to cause the user to activate it - but it would be easy to represent it as an innocent link to Google or any site. Pressing the link would initiate the wipe. Users of vulnerable handsets may be able to install a third-party dialler and make that the default as protection against the &quot;remote wipe&quot; attack. Experts also pointed out that not all Android handsets have the capability for a remote wipe built in - although the number of models discovered with the vulnerability has grown since it became known on Tuesday. Dylan Reeve, a New Zealand-based TV editor who first brought the flaw to wide notice, says that Samsung Galaxy phones which use Android 4.1 will be safe from the hack. But that still leaves millions of Galaxy S2 and some S3 models which will not have had the correct revision of the firmware rolled out to them and which could be hit.  The number of phones that could be vulnerable potentially numbers millions. Samsung has shipped more than 20m Galaxy S3 handsets and at least as many of the S2 handset, released in 2011. HTC has similarly sold millions of Desire and One X handsets. But many will have shipped with versions of Android which are vulnerable to this attack, and there are no figures to show what proportion have been updated. The vast majority of the 480m Android devices in use at present have versions of Android which could potentially be vulnerable to this attack. Though the vulnerability was fixed in Android&apos;s core code earlier this year, that code has not been propagated to every handset in use. The fact that the flaw existed in handsets from Samsung and HTC - the two biggest vendors of Android handsets - also suggests that a huge number of existing handsets could include the outdated code. Samsung said in a statement that it has already provided a patch for the Galaxy S3, but it is not clear how long that will take for operator approval and rollout. In general software updates to any phone have to first be tested and approved by the carrier supporting the phone. Samsung said it is testing a patch for the Galaxy S2, but had no information on when it will be available or how it will be distributed. At first it was thought that only Samsung phones were vulnerable. But some HTC devices, including the HTC One X running HTC Sense 4.0 with Android 4.0.3 and the Motorola Defy (running Cyanogen Mod 7 on Android 2.3.5), have also been shown to suffer from the flaw. Commenting after the discovery that multiple makes and models are vulnerable, Reeve commented: &quot;it is very poor design to allow a passed value to execute as if it were keyed in interactively.&quot; Paul Ducklin of the security company Sophos said: &quot;The bottom line here is this: get into the habit of backing up your phone. Whether you choose to trust the cloud, or synchronise to your laptop, or just copy important files to removable storage, don&apos;t take the long-term data integrity of your phone for granted.&quot;  The video at the top of the page shows the attack being carried out. Reeve has created a web page that allows people to test whether their phone passes on and processes the tel: prefix automatically. If the phone allows the automatic processing of tel: codes, Reeve&apos;s page displays the IMEI code.  This article was updated on 28 September 2012 to reflect a statement from HTC that its phones do not have the security weakness described here.",

    "text": "The contrast between the farmers&apos; milk price dispute and other trade disputes revealed in the coverage in the Guardian and elsewhere could not be more marked (Dairy farmers step up pressure at plants over milk price cuts, 21 July). There are blockades of milk plants, but no restrictions on numbers of protesters. There is no requirement to hold a ballot. Ministers rush to arrange meetings with the parties within 48 hours, with no condemnation of the action. Strangest of all, there is no sight of those usually so quick and loud to criticise any trade union action involving people trying to protect their livelihoods. Kelvin McKenzie, Digby Jones, the Taxpayers&apos; Alliance, and the CBI, where are you?Peter SkyteLondon Your editorial about milk prices (Dairy industry: milking the market, 24 July) implicitly supports (possibly illegal) picketing action by farmers in the runup to the Olympic Games. No condemnation of action that could lead to shortage of milk in the shops. Your leader could be reworded easily to attack short-term profit-making in many other areas including job cuts in the civil service. I look forward to reading of your support for workers in the UK Border Agency who are to strike against short-sighted job cuts that put our borders at risk or those in HM Revenue and Customs that risk collection of billions of pounds regardless of the timing. History will reflect on government motives as we are now over the Thatcher/Reagan policies that led to the current practices in the financial sector, where bringing the country to its knees is punished by a slap on the wrists.Paul KennedyGuiseley, West Yorkshire The state of the dairy industry and its consequences for all of us  let alone cows  surely mean we should question our apparent dependence on milk and ask whether that should continue. Your editorial did neither  not even in passing.Dr Alex MayManchester",

    "text": "It is the talk of the cafes in Kasserine, a town set in an arid plain overlooked by the Jebel ech Chambi mountain that separates Tunisia from Algeria. A year ago, as Tunisia rose up against the regime of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, the town&apos;s young people won heroic status by facing down police bullets. There were 20 deaths. One of the protesters&apos; main demands was for jobs, but now local officials are speaking out against the dangerous infiltration of local job schemes by racketeers. &quot;It&apos;s not a little mafia, it&apos;s big mafia,&quot; emphasises Maher Bouazzi, 38, a lawyer who, since May, has headed the town council. &quot;Investigating the scale of this racket, I have received threats. People come to me from Hay Zuhur [a poor neighbourhood] to say they have been asked to warn me that &apos;other people&apos; may burn my car.&quot; Town hall officials who are investigating have received even more violent and graphic threats, he adds. &quot;Even the ministers in Tunis know that when they move to unseat this mafia, they will have to move carefully.&quot; After the revolution, the publicly funded work schemes were expanded by an interim government desperate to respond to the demand for jobs. But with central government exercising only shaky control over Kasserine, a new level of corruption has flourished around the schemes, which are known as chantiers (work yards) in French. Those milking them for profit have also bought influence among the lower-ranking staff at the regional governor&apos;s office, according to Bouazzi and other sources in Kasserine. There are signs that Tunis is aware of the problem. Hocine Dimassi, the finance minister in the Islamist-led government that took office in December, has criticised stopgap measures to ease unemployment, which he said have so far cost 767m dinars ($509m) while &quot;circling around the problem without really homing in on it  This is a useless waste, at a time when the country lacks means to face up to the explosion of needs.&quot; The chantier system was introduced under Ben Ali. As people drifted in from the countryside to swell the poorer neighbourhoods of provincial towns, his Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD) party used the schemes to defuse tension and build up networks of patronage. In the countryside, the revolution has uncovered a huge need for better housing, transport, health services, water supplies and nutrition. Families still tend to be large, and often struggle to survive on what one or two wage-earners bring in from the odd day of low-paid work. The patchy coverage of the previous regime&apos;s welfare safety net remains in place, but newly vocal communities are increasingly impatient for change. In Kasserine, unemployment was more than 36% before the revolution among those with recent higher education diplomas  and has risen since. Workers lucky enough to be accepted on to a scheme by a chantier foreman are sent to work as cleaners or in other unskilled jobs in local government offices, hospitals, schools or forestry projects. Around 18,000 people are now estimated to be registered in chantiers across the Kasserine region. They are each paid about 250 dinars ($166) a month out of public funds. Corrupt foremen handing out the wages take upwards of 50 dinars ($33) off each person, local people confirm. If the worker stays at home, the foreman may skim as much as 100 dinars ($66) off the pay packet, and he also pads out the payroll with non-existent workers. Local figures speaking out against the scam include former RCD members who now argue for a clean-out of a network that is believed to overlap with well-known local contraband operators previously protected by the family of Leila Trabelsi, Ben Ali&apos;s wife. Most worryingly, officials believe that some of the funds raised are ploughed into the smuggling of Algerian hashish and petrol, and arms bound for Libya. Dr Mahjoub Kahri, a departmental head at the local hospital who is also a correspondent for the national newspaper Ach-Chourouk, calculates that a corrupt chantier foreman can &quot;easily&quot; cream off 60,000 dinars ($39,800) a month from his payroll of hundreds of people. But any governor moving against the racketeers risks seeing them mobilise their client networks for another bout of looting and attacks on public buildings  as happened when a previous governor was ousted in July. Kahri said the risk is that &quot;when the authorities move against these bandits, Kasserine will burn again&quot;. No interior ministry official was available for comment in Kasserine last week. Bouazzi, however, was cheered by the news last Thursday that a magistrate had opened a judicial investigation into allegations of embezzlement against one leading chantier foreman. &quot;This is a first for Kasserine. It is very significant,&quot; he said.",

    "text": "EA&apos;s latest in its much-lauded city-building series hasn&apos;t fared too well so far. The need for the internet always to be on has led to chronic server problems, with many owners simply unable to log on and play the game. Several community and sharing features have been stripped out to help server load, making it hard to get a feel for everything the game offers. It could be great, though  once connected, SimCity proves to be complex yet accessible, with citizens&apos; demands on your resources proving a satisfying challenge to meet. However, I&apos;d wait for server glitches to be fully dealt with  and hope for an offline mode to be introduced  before visiting this particular metropolis.",

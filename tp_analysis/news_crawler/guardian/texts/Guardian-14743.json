    "text": "Depending on who you talk to, Deadly Premonition is either a joke or a masterpiece. Essentially Twin Peaks refracted through a Japanese survival horror prism, the game first hit the Xbox 360 back in 2010, where its off-kilter character interactions and bizarre optional activities (shaving! Peeping through strangers&apos; windows!) sealed its cult status. Now it&apos;s arrived on the PS3, in the form of a revised and expanded &quot;director&apos;s cut&quot;. Plenty of rough edges remain  the characters look like refugees from an airline safety video  but for the most part these add to the eeriness. Capable of swinging from zany to nasty, inspired to absurd within the course of a single sequence, it remains a must-play for connoisseurs of kitsch.",

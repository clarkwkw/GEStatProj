But the garden is land locked and the ducklings can't fly so it could all end in tears  Photograph: Max Riddington       Spring in Sydney: Lowering trees of Sydney Australia  Photograph: Jago Trude       Spring flowers in Helsinki Photograph: ManeTheMean       cherry blossom. seoul. south korea Photograph: Yongmin Chae       Colorful Spring Photograph: Fangfang Niu       Baby Eve: The firstborn kid goat on our tiny smallholding in the Forest of Dean.

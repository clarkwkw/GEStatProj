    "text": "On this week&apos;s Science Weekly, presented by Camila Ruz, we talk to one of Nasa&apos;s leading engineers on the Curiosity Mars rover mission, Paolo Bellutta, who has the rare distinction of holding an interplanetary driving licence.  Paolo was speaking to Science Weekly ahead of his presentation at the Royal Society of Chemistry in London on Thursday, which will be streamed live. Click here to find out more. Camila also interviewed Professor Pratibha Gai, winner of this year&apos;s L&apos;Oral-Unesco for Women in Science Award, Europe. Pratibha&apos;s work in molecular microscopy is opening up new worlds in the medical and material sciences. Camila was joined in the studio by scientist and journalist Maria Botcharova to discuss some of this week&apos;s major science news stories, including dinosaur embryos and the thorny issue of conducting research into psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, which may have a role in treating severe depression. Finally, Guardian design and architecture writer Oliver Wainwright dropped by to discuss 4D printing and a future world in which chairs assemble themselves and nano-robots track down and kill cancer cells.

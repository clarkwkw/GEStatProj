A 69p app for those hankering after Street View now that Apple has done away with it by dropping Google as its default map provider. An iOS app to experience Street Views &gt;&gt; Live Street Views  Live Street View is an iOS app that enables its users to use their device as a viewport to the world. By utilizing the built-in compass of your iOS device you can experience places as if you&apos;re standing right there.   What&apos;s the betting this $1/79p app suddenly makes its creator quite wealthy? Google Maps announces a 400-year advantage over Apple Maps &gt;&gt; Telemapics blog  The issue plaguing Apple Maps is not mathematics or algorithms, it is data quality and there can be little doubt about the types of errors that are plaguing the system. What is happening to Apple is that their users are measuring data quality. Users look for familiar places they know on maps and use these as methods of orienting themselves, as well as for testing the goodness of maps. They compare maps with reality to determine their location. They query local businesses to provide local services. When these actions fail, the map has failed and this is the source of Apple&apos;s most significant problems. Apple&apos;s maps are incomplete, illogical, positionally erroneous, out of date, and suffer from thematic inaccuracies.  Source: Apple aggressively recruiting ex-Google Maps staff to build out iOS Maps &gt;&gt; TechCrunch  Apple is going after people with experience working on Google Maps to develop its own product, according to a source with connections on both teams. Using recruiters, Apple is pursuing a strategy of luring away Google Maps employees who helped develop the search giant&apos;s product on contract, and many of those individuals seem eager to accept due in part to the opportunity Apple represents to build new product, instead of just doing &quot;tedious updates&quot; on a largely complete platform.   The Soul Of A New Atlas. What Will Marissa Do?: Mayer to reveal strategy to troops this week &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  In the memo, titled &quot;Board slides, strategy and goals,&quot; Mayer talked about the meetings. There will be two this Tuesday, one in the morning and one later in the day, in order to accommodate Yahoo staffers internationally.  &quot;In an act of radical transparency that will be a tradition moving forward,&quot; Mayer promised that she will go over the slides -- which are usually not shared widely -- of her &quot;strategy and vision&quot; that she presented at the board meeting on Friday.  &quot;We want to offer you transparency into what happens at the board level as well as guidance as to where the company is going,&quot; Mayer noted.  Kudos to that! (And send all that transparency my way, please!)  Mayer also said in the memo that she will have another all-hands meeting on October 1, where she will begin &quot;rolling out a new system and process for goals for the company,&quot; including annual goals that will be tracked and graded -- first on a company level, then to departments, teams and, finally, individuals.  AskPatents.com: A Stack Exchange to prevent bad patents &gt;&gt; Stack Exchange  Ask Patents is a new Stack Exchange site launching today that allows anyone to participate in the patent examination process. It&apos;s a collaborative effort, supported by Stack Exchange, the US Patent and Trademark Office, and the Google Patent Search team. It&apos;s very exciting, because it is opening up a process that has been conducted behind closed doors for over 200 years.   Gotta love Stack Exchange. Samsung figured out how the jury arrived at its damages figures (except for the Galaxy Tab 10.1) &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents A sort of legal reverse-engineering means that Samsung reckons it knows how the jury reached its figures - but they contain inconsistencies.   The related jury award of $57.9m dollars [for the Galaxy Prevail] will have to be adjusted. If the same methodology (50% of Apple&apos;s royalty demand) as for the other software-patents-only items was applied, we&apos;d be talking about a few million dollars, not tens of millions. And I guess this is one adjustment that Judge Koh will very likely make. This one adjustment alone would be enough to take the damages award (prior to any of the enhancements requested by Apple) below the psychologically important billion-dollar threshold, and Samsung might then try to argue that this contrary-to-law approach by the jury to the damages figure for one of two dozen products dictates a retrial on all damages numbers.  What remains a mystery is how the jury arrived at its award of $833,076 in damages for the Galaxy Tab 10.1 (WiFi).  Samsung asks for JMOL, or new trial and remittitur - says Apple v. Samsung trial was not fair; jury messed up &gt;&gt; Groklaw JMOL is &quot;judgement as a matter of law&quot;; &quot;remittitur&quot; means the lowering of a damages award by a judge.   There are many other examples of what Samsung feels are jury mistakes. The worst example is in the area of damages, where the figures simply make no sense at all. Samsung actually phrases it more tactfully, saying that &quot;the basis for the jury&apos;s award is unclear.&quot; I&apos;ll say. That section begins on page 28 of the PDF.  But it wasn&apos;t just the jury that goofed, Samsung says. It was also the court, in that the jury instructions did not properly explain aspects of the law of trade dress, for example, or what is required to establish willfulness (see footnotes 8, 10 and 11).  Samsung also says that no rational jury could find Apple&apos;s design patents valid. First, they are all functional, Samsung argues, and hence not protectable, there&apos;s at least one issue of double patenting, and there is prior art.  Patterns Could Be the Next Minecraft &gt;&gt; IGN  Like Minecraft, Patterns places your avatar in a world where you can gather materials and then use them to create new objects and structures. Your character, shown in the demo as a humanoid made up of triangles and other geometrical shapes, uses its mind to break apart substances and also use them to create new objects. You don&apos;t use or create tools like those of Minecraft, instead the focus of Patterns is less on survival and more about exploring a world that challenges you to create.   So, like Minecraft in Creative mode then. Messaging, lists and more for couples on iPhone, Android, and web &gt;&gt; Avocado &quot;Some things work better in pairs&quot;. Groan-making pun, yet this is also a very clever idea - if it can be multi-platform.  You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

    "text": "Choosing a university course is an expensive, life-changing decision. Get it right, and you&apos;ve got a springboard for your future career, the joy of studying something you love, and the chance to make some lifelong friends. Jill Sawyer, head of student progress at Varndean College in Brighton, says: &quot;There&apos;s such an amazing choice of courses it&apos;s quite a tricky business whittling them down.&quot; Here are useful ideas on how to proceed.  Think about yourself &quot;Students have to really think about what they want to do and why,&quot; says Kevin Betts, student recruitment officer at the University of Sussex. &quot;Your mum might want you to become a lawyer but when you&apos;ve got a hangover will you go to the lecture in a subject you don&apos;t enjoy? &quot;  Do your research With 40,000 full-time courses there&apos;s a lot to read up on. Don&apos;t just set your heart on one university at the start. Get detailed information on the websites of the universities that appeal to you most and check requirements against your predicted grades.The Guardian university guide ranks courses at every institution in the UK and the university profiles give you a good idea of what it is actually like to gothere.  Go to open days  &quot;Talk to students and staff, get more in-depth information on the modules, years abroad or sandwich courses,&quot; says Judy Hollands, careers coordinator at Varndean College. A-level student Azaan Symes, also at Varndean, agrees: &quot;I went to see Sussex University, but not at open day, and it really appealed to me. I regret not seeing as many universities as I could have. &quot;  Look at the detail  Courses can differ hugely between universities, even if they have the same name. Don&apos;t forget that combined courses are a possibility and that there are plenty of subjects you might never have thought of. &quot;We had a scientist who ended up on an astrophysics course she didn&apos;t know was possible,&quot; says Anita Porter, senior tutor and progression coordinator at Impington Village College.  Consider the location  Do you want to live on a quiet campus or in a busy city? How will the cost of living vary? If you are thinking about studying in Europe, make sure you have looked at a map and know exactly where you&apos;re going.  Ask serious questions Between applications and offers, universities are in the driving seat. But once you&apos;ve received your offers, it&apos;s up to you to take control and decide which one you&apos;ll accept. So you need to find out as much information as you can. &quot;Ask about employability, teaching, how many hours a week you see your personal tutor,&quot; says Betts. &quot;Ask: &apos;Why should I come to you?&apos; It&apos;s your life, your debt and you&apos;ve got to make the right decision.&quot;  Think about career prospects Check the course&apos;s employability ratings and whether it offers workplacements and internships.

Having a first or a 2.1 is often not enough to put you above the competition. Check the university&apos;s employability statistics and its rankings. A better university is more appealing to employers. Think about location. Look at hidden costs, such as transport. Look at bursaries and fee waivers.And get in touch with the students&apos; union and establish what they do to provide opportunities and contacts. Rebecca Matus, second-year student, politics, University of Sussex When I came to look at Sussex it was sunny, the campus looked amazing and I knew Brighton because of family holidays. The required grades for the politics and international relations course I wanted to do were higher than those I was predicted to get, but I thought: I have to come here. So I upped my game and I got in. The course is very difficult but you have to stick it out. Brighton night life is very good, but since the first year I don&apos;t go out as much as I thought I would. I&apos;m here to get a degree.     Guardian students sign up banner  ",

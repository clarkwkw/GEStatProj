    "text": "I think pugs are actually the perfect dog for YouTubers, just because theyre lapdogs. YouTubers spend a lot of time at home, and theyre perfect companion dogs. When you need to work, they dont mind. They love sleeping! Daniel Middleton, aka DanTDM from child-friendly YouTube gaming channel The Diamond Minecart, has been working a lot. Hes the most popular British creator on YouTube, with 12.7 million subscribers and 8.3bn video views since 2012. In July, the 24 year-olds channel was the 13th most popular YouTube channel by views  just under 335m that month  and hes reached the level of online fame where his pet pugs Ellie and Darcie are becoming four-legged celebrities in their own right, just like fellow YouTuber Felix PewDiePie Kjellbergs pugs Edgar and Maya.            Pugs arent all that DanTDM and PewDiePie share: Middleton has followed Kjellbeg into the publishing world thanks to a book deal with publisher Orion. Trayaurus and the Enchanted Crystal is a graphic novel based on the characters that feature in Middletons Minecraft videos on YouTube: scientist Dr Trayaurus; evil laboratory boss Denton and his elf sidekick Fin; DanTDM and his dog Grim; and a group of grumpy talking pigs.   Related: Joseph Garrett, the childrens presenter with 7.8 million subscribers    Middleton has been mulling a book for several years, but says he turned down the idea of an end-of-year annual in favour of something more story-led. Im not a massive reader of traditional books. Im a very visual person, which is probably why I make videos rather than write scripts. I wanted it to be a book that was not just interesting to read, but also very interesting to look at, he says. Its the kind of book that I would read, and maybe a way to transfer fans that maybe arent big readers either from my videos to the book. And in the videos these characters are pretty much [stock] Minecraft characters, so this was a way to bring them into their own, outside the game, in a hand-drawn style thats very important to me.     The first DanTDM book is a graphic novel rather than a standard annual.    Accidental narrative Those characters have been key to the growth of Middletons fanbase on YouTube. His young audience arent just watching him play Minecraft: theyre watching him tell stories using the game as the backdrop. Middleton says his focus on narrative and characters was a happy accident that sprang out of his videos showcasing Minecraft mods  downloadable add-ons that customised the game. For one mod based on dinosaurs, Middleton used one of Minecrafts villager characters to help him explore the world. People really connected with the story of Trayaurus going through that video: it made it less of a tutorial and more of a story, even though they were still learning about the mod. So I started introducing him into more videos, then we went into a lab and found Grim, and it grew from there, he says. The characters have evolved over time, with some of their traits generated by Minecrafts quirks  Trayaurus clumsiness comes from the characters habit of blundering into lava pits and other obstacles, out of Middletons control.   Related: YouTube channels benefit as kids look beyond traditional TV    Middletons own back-story started as a viewer on animation website Newgrounds, which inspired him to start making his own stop-motion animations and uploading them to YouTube: The only way to show other people your videos without literally sitting them in front of your screen! A keen gamer, he also started a Pokmon-focused YouTube channel in 2010  Dan Plays Pokmon is still online  before discovering Minecraft, which was initially a side-project channel. Although often described as a Minecraft YouTuber, Middleton now makes videos using other games too: Roblox and Nintendos Tomodachi Life for example. At one point, I was doing two Minecraft videos every single day, and while its kinda possible to do that, I wanted to expand, and my audience really wanted to see me play other games, he says. I havent uploaded a Minecraft video for about a week actually. People have been starting to connect not just with my stories, but with me as a person. So the main story videos are still in Minecraft because thats the perfect game to do them in, but its cool to also take those characters into other games.            YouTube-famous in the real world Middleton and his YouTube gaming peers have a very specific kind of fame: they can walk down the street and most passers-by will have no idea who they are, but to many children (and some parents) hes a bona-fide star. I get spotted more when Im out now just because of the size of the channel. More so in school holidays. But even when Im out and about in school or work hours, its the parents wholl see me and say I need to get a picture with you to show my kids, says Middleton. Its nice though: the difference between traditional celebrities and the people who are popular on YouTube, I guess, is that we seem more accessible than traditional celebrities. They can seem completely inaccessible: they dont walk the streets that everyone else does. But when people come up to me, even though Ive not met them before, they feel like theyve known me for years, and theres a proper connection there.   Related: YouTube's latest hit: neon superheroes, giant ducks and plenty of lycra    It must be quite strange, though. Especially as few YouTubers will receive formal training in what to expect as a celebrity in the same way that, for example, a boy-band member or teenage soap star would be expected to receive. Not an idle comparison, by the way: if you go to a games convention or book signing, the fan excitement around online stars like Middleton is absolutely comparable to traditional celebrities. Plus theres the fact that while the default persona for a YouTuber is HEY GUYS exuberance, thats not always mirrored by their off-camera selves. The last time I interviewed Joseph Stampy Garrett, another prominent child-friendly British YouTuber, he told me that he worries his real-life shyness might be misinterpreted as standoffishness by fans. Middleton is in a similar situation. Its pretty weird to get used to. I wouldnt even say Im used to it yet. If people turn up to an event and are really excited to meet me, if I think about it properly it baffles me. Im naturally quite an introverted person, so Ive had to almost train myself to be able to deal with these situations, he says. The security for me is that if I meet someone on the street or at a convention or signing, theres that connection: we can have a chat about what I do, their favourite things, my favourite things. Its not a weird situation after all.     The DanTDM tour has been selling out UK theatres.    The long queues for meetngreets at games conventions is proving intensive training for DanTDM, Stampy and their peers, but Middleton is also meeting his public at his own live shows, which have been touring the UK. Again, theyre led by storytelling: A mix of maybe a panto and gaming. But not cheesy! as he puts it. Its about the adventures, but taking away me behind the computer and making it completely interactive, with the characters involved, and gaming running through it all as well, he says. Its properly scripted and fully rehearsed, with a team of about 25-30 people behind it. A proper theatre show! Choosing YouTube over television Middleton is keen to maintain a creative quality control of passion projects like the live show and book, which extends to his views on how his videos may develop. Like Garrett, who recently told the Observer that YouTube isnt a stepping stone, Middleton doesnt see his future in traditional broadcast television.   Related: Minecraft costumes and bewildered parents: a YouTuber at the UK's biggest games event    I feel that what weve got as YouTubers with our own channels is always going to be the perfect outlet. The content is completely ours: we decide how we create it, whether its with a team or by ourselves, and its free to consume for everyone, he says. Say I created something really awesome, Im not sure theres many situations where Id want to distribute it anywhere other than my own channel. The media often assume that the top level is TV for someone like me, but I dont see it that way. Games? Thats another story. PewDiePie (and his pugs) are currently starring in a mobile game, PewDiePies Tuber Simulator, which was downloaded more than 1m times in the first 24 hours after its release. US YouTube gamer Jordan CaptainSparklez Maron has co-founded a mobile games studio. What price a DanTDM game? Its definitely something Im interested in, and something were going to pursue maybe next year, says Middleton, who says time constraints are the only reasons hes not already working on this kind of project. Its definitely something Id like to do.     PewDiePie Tuber Simulator has been a hit: could DanTDM follow suit?    The lessons from YouTubers ventures into publishing, games and live shows are being shared within the community, which has always had collaboration at its heart rather than traditional celebrity-style beefs. Youre more likely to find DanTDM and Stampy collaborating on a Mario Kart 8 video or horsing around on-stage at a Minecraft conference than igniting any kind of Blur/Oasis-style rivalry. Whats cool about YouTube, unlike TV, is that there isnt that competition element. I mean, you could make it into that, as theres obviously numbers involved, but people are free to watch whoever they want, says Middleton. You dont have to make the choice to watch either me or Stampy. You can do both. And on a personal level, when we meet up at a gaming convention or wherever, its good to be able to talk to people who are in exactly the same situation as you. That support will be important as Middleton plots his continued career. Plus the support of his pugs, of course. The dogs have become their own characters: theyre a part of my live show now, he says. I just love the breed: theyre really suited to people, not just YouTubers but anyone who works from home, because of their temperament.",

    "text": "Every student reaches that anxious moment when their degree ends, and suddenly they have to face the real world. With one in three graduates in a lower skilled job, the appetite for gap years at an all-time low and the recession showing no sign of receding, students have to be dogged in their quest for jobs in the fiercely competitive graduate market. A major boon for the undecided student is the graduate fair, where graduates can meet potential employers, research industries they are interested in, and market themselves. I spoke to students at the the Summer Graduate Fair in London last week. They were just completing their degrees, and I asked them what they thought about gap years and about their plans for the post-graduation future.      Ed Pithie, 21, drama and film studies, University of Kent&quot;I started career planning as soon as I&apos;d handed in my final piece of coursework. There&apos;s not that many careers related to drama and film that I really want to do, so I&apos;m thinking of applying for something sales or marketing related  and writing is another interest.&quot;      Matt Caddie, 20, history, University of Kent&quot;I&apos;ve really enjoyed my degree subject and think it&apos;s been helpful for my career so I am going on to do a masters. I disagree with people who say university isn&apos;t &apos;worth it&apos; anymore, as I definitely couldn&apos;t have got a job before uni. After my masters, I&apos;m looking to go into sales and marketing and maybe business management.&quot;      Louise Arathoon, 21, physics and philosophy, King&apos;s College London&quot;I&apos;ve got a place on a postgraduate course but am still unsure if I&apos;m going to take it, so I&apos;m just looking at what other graduate opportunities are out there.Last year I was ill and couldn&apos;t sit my exams, so I was forced to take an impromptu gap year. I think the travelling experience is really important, but then again, if I&apos;d been able to continue my studies and graduate normally, I would have just headed straight into work.&quot;      Cassie Taylor, 22, business management and marketing, Nottingham Trent &quot;The modules on my course and the work that I&apos;ve been doing has helped in interviews, and I spent my placement year with the company GE which was really valuable. The graduate market is tough at the moment. There&apos;s a lot of rejection and also uncertainty as to whether the employer has even looked at your application, but it&apos;s important to remember that there are still jobs out there.&quot;      Mohit Khanna, 23, finance and business management, University of Bedfordshire&quot;I don&apos;t actually agree with gap years. The market is so tough at the moment that I just think it&apos;s important to get out there and look for a job as soon as possible.&quot;",

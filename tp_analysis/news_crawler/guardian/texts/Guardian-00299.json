    "headline": "Peter Thiel faces Silicon Valley backlash after pledging $1.25m to Trump", 
    "text": "Tech billionaire Peter Thiels reported $1.25m contribution to Donald Trumps presidential campaign has prompted a high-profile Silicon Valley organization to cut ties with a startup incubator backed by the Republican donor. Ellen Pao, a former Reddit executive and vocal advocate for diversity in tech, has announced that her group Project Include is ending its relationship with Y Combinator, the well-known startup accelerator where Thiel is a part-time partner. Thiels actions are in direct conflict with our values at Project Include, Pao wrote on Monday, referring to the not-for-profit group that she and a group of prominent Silicon Valley women formed earlier this year to push for diversity and inclusion solutions in the tech industry. Because of his continued connection to YC [Y Combinator], we are compelled to break off our relationship with YC. We hope this situation changes, and that we are both willing to move forward together in the future. Today it is clear to us that our values are not aligned, Pao continued. Influential developer and Tumblr co-founder Marco Arment also called out Y-Combinator for sticking with Thiel. This is literally paying a huge amount of money to directly support a racist, sexist bigot with rapidly mounting allegations of multiple sexual assaults, he wrote. [Y-Combinator is] defending the large-scale support of racism, bigotry, and sexual assault by an influential partner and advisor to their startups as its own form of diversity. The announcement signals possible fallout in the California tech industry surrounding the political donations and campaigning of Thiel, who helped found PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook. Thiel, a conservative outlier in the Democratic stronghold of Silicon Valley, became a state delegate for Trump earlier this year and delivered a much-discussed speech at the Republican national convention, during which he said: I am proud to be gay.           Peter Thiel at Republican convention: I am proud to be gay    The tech mogul also made headlines earlier this year when news broke that he was secretly bankrolling former wrestler Hulk Hogans lawsuit against Gawker, the media company that subsequently went bankrupt. Thiels embrace of Trump baffled many over the summer, but critics were particularly shocked to see him strengthen his support of the real estate mogul at a time when many conservatives and Republican party leaders are disavowing the embattled presidential candidate. After Trump was caught on a leaked tape bragging about groping women and kissing them without consent, the candidate has faced a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations from women across the US. In the wake of the revelations, many elected Republicans have announced that they are withdrawing their support.   Related: Donald Trump, Peter Thiel and the death of democracy    Thiel, however, remained silent over the past week, reportedly ignoring journalists inquiries about whether his position had changed. Then on Saturday, the New York Times reported that Thiel was living up to his reputation as the most contrarian soul in Silicon Valley and would be giving $1.25m to Trump through a combination of Super Pac gifts and donations directly to the campaign. The donations make Thiel one of just a few major donors to Trump, who has been widely rejected by tech leaders and wealthy conservatives. Thiels spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Thiels support of Trump had already put pressure on Facebook, where he sits on the board. After the new donations were revealed, many on social media called on Y Combinator to dump Thiel, noting that the startup firm was effectively supporting someone who has backed an overtly racist, misogynistic and xenophobic campaign.  Y Combinators president, Sam Altman, responded with a series of tweets on Sunday night, saying Trump is an unacceptable threat to America and unfit to be president.      Ellen Pao  who made headlines last year for her sexual discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers  wrote that Project Include could not continue to partner with Y Combinator at this time.

Pao  who made headlines last year for her sexual discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers  wrote that Project Include could not continue to partner with Y Combinator at this time. While all of us believe in the ideas of free speech and open platforms, we draw a line here, she said. We agree that people shouldnt be fired for their political views, but this isnt a disagreement on tax policy, this is advocating hatred and violence. Pao told the Guardian that it was unclear whether other tech leaders would follow suit and end partnerships with Thiel.  I think its starting a conversation, but I havent seen it really fracture Silicon Valley in any significant way. She added: The power in Silicon Valley is concentrated in the hands of very few people, and it is hard to try to go up against that. Some have noted that Thiels support of Trump is not all that surprising considering the tech billionaires openly sexist views. In 2009, he argued that capitalist politics have struggled because women can vote. The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics, Thiel wrote. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women  two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians  have rendered the notion of capitalist democracy into an oxymoron. Altman did not answer questions about Project Includes announcement, but sent the Guardian a statement, saying, We shouldnt start purging people for supporting the wrong political candidate. Continuing to partner with Thiel is a way to support diversity, he wrote, even if it is painful and unpopular. But, he added, If Peter said some of the things Trump says himself, he would no longer be part of Y Combinator.",

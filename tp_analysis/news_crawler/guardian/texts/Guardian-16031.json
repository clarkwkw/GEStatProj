Why multitouch on notebooks makes perfect sense &gt;&gt; Chicago Grid Andy Ihnatko:   I&apos;m in the middle of my deep-soak testing of Google&apos;s Chromebook Pixel (review coming soon). This is the first time I&apos;ve spent a whole week with a touchscreen-enabled notebook as my daily driver, to do all of my actual work. I try to to deep-soak testing because I often learn things I wouldn&apos;t have figured out if I were being more casual about it. I&apos;ve had other touchscreen notebooks on loan, but they all failed to pass the &quot;Meh&quot; test. So they never made it to the &quot;deep soak&quot; stage. What I&apos;ve learned from my experience with the Pixel is that I&apos;m using the touchscreen a lot. And it almost blows my mind. I never would have expected that.  Citizen Eco-Drive Proximity review: a different kind of smartwatch &gt;&gt; The Verge  The Proximity can only really do one thing other than tell the time, and that&apos;s vibrate. It can vibrate when you get a phone call; when you get an email; when you have a calendar alert; and when it loses connection. You can&apos;t set it to vibrate differently for each thing, so the watch uses its ticking secondhand to tell you why it&apos;s buzzing. When you get an alert, the hand stops ticking and sweeps quickly to 9, 10, or 11 o&apos;clock to let you know what just happened. 9 is LL, which means the watch has lost connection with your phone  this happens a lot, often seemingly for no reason, so even though it makes your wrist jitter too often it&apos;s probably a good thing to have.  This seems to be a different use of the word &quot;good&quot; than the usual one. As is &quot;different&quot; in the headline. Welcome to the Bush-Obama White House: They&apos;re Spying on Us - NationalJournal.com Ron Fournier:   And now this: The Guardian newspaper reports that the National Security Agency is collecting telephone records of tens of millions of customers of one of the nation&apos;s largest phone companies, Verizon. If the story is accurate, the action appears to be legal. The order was signed by a judge from a secret court that oversees domestic surveillance. It may also be necessary; US intelligence needs every advantage it can get over the nation&apos;s enemies. But for several reasons the news is chilling. Verizon probably isn&apos;t the only company coughing up its documents. Odds are incredibly strong that the government is prying into your telephone records today. Issued in April, the NSA order &quot;could represent the broadest surveillance order known to have been issued,&quot; according to The Washington Post. &quot;It also would confirm long-standing suspicions of civil liberties advocates about the sweeping nature of US surveillance through commercial carries under laws passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.&quot; This appears to be a &quot;rubber stamp,&quot; order, reissued every few months since 2001. As is the case with all government programs, the systematic snooping into your telephone records is unlikely to ever expire without public outcry.  Going on since 2001? That&apos;s a long time.

Google is the General Electric of the 21st century &gt;&gt; FT.com John Gapper:   Indeed, the best comparison for Google seems to me not Microsoft in the 1980s but General Electric in the late 19th century  the age of electrification. Like GE, Google is a multifaceted industrial enterprise riding a wave of technology with an uncanny ability not only to invent far-reaching products but also to produce them commercially. It coincides with Larry Page&apos;s ascent to being undisputed leader of the company he founded at Stanford University with Sergey Brin 15 years ago. Instead of the &quot;Google guys&quot;  Mr Page, Mr Brin and Eric Schmidt, its former chief executive and now chairman  running it as an amiable mixture of a company and a chaotic research lab, Mr Page has made it formidably focused.

BBM not coming to iOS and Android June 27 &gt;&gt; Business Insider  There&apos;s a report spreading around today that BBM is coming to iPhones and Android devices on 27 June. The report is based on a tweet from T-Mobile&apos;s UK account [tweet since deleted] According to a source with knowledge of BlackBerry&apos;s plans, that date is not correct. In fact, our source called all those stories you may have read &quot;bogus.&quot;  Except that 27 June is the day before BlackBerry&apos;s first-quarter results are announced. It would be a smart day to do it. The deletion of the tweets might mean they&apos;re correct. Corrected article to remove duplicate links from Thursday. Apologies for the error.

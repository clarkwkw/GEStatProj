According to the news website, the 61-year-old computer engineer went on to explain that it was a case of living in the wrong part of town, with the worst kind of service. &quot;I live one kilometere out of the main part of town,&quot; he told the Perth-based forum. News.com.au said he continued: &quot;Broadband is a monopoly in my town. That means you can get it from a cable company  but I don&apos;t have cable.&quot; Wozniak added that there are &quot;50 companies&quot; trying to sell him DSL, but they would have to go through the local phone company Horizon&apos;s wires. &quot;I&apos;ve got one of the two worst Horizons in the country. And so I can&apos;t get broadband in my house,&quot; he reportedly said. Wozniak is hailed as a tech hero by fans of all things Apple. Having founded the company alongside Steve Jobs, Wozniak created the Apple I and Apple II computers in the mid 1970s.

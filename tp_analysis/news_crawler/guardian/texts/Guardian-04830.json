Apple Will Discontinue Ping in Next iTunes Update &gt;&gt; AllThingsD John Paczkowski:   Sources close to the company say that Ping, which still exists today in iTunes 10.6.3 and the iOS 6 beta -- where it doesn&apos;t work, will be gone with the software&apos;s next major release, likely scheduled for this fall.

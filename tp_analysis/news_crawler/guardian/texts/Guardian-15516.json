    "text": "I have an overwhelming sense of frustration. I have a reception child, aged four, who desperately needs some serious, long-term therapy. In school she is unmanageable. She bites, kicks, hits and runs. She has serious attachment and speech and language needs. This results in an inability to form appropriate relationships with either adults or her peers. She will plough through a group of children to get something she wants, unaware that she is hurting them as she does so. Though she is quite bright, she has limited understanding of what is said to her and we have to think carefully how we put things. We try to use visual resources to help her to understand. She is looked after by her aunt and uncle, as her parents were unable to cope. At home, her carers are doing their best in almost impossible circumstances, trying to cope with this lovely but very challenging little girl. We are attempting to do the same by trying to keep her in school so that there is a sense of routine for her, familiar people, regularity. And it gives her aunt and uncle a break. We provide for her as best we can, with one-to-one support and as much help for her carers as we can possibly manage. And we&apos;ll carry on fighting for help from other agencies, too, for the sake of this child. My frustration is with the amount of time it takes for referrals to health professionals to go through, whether it&apos;s mental health services or paediatricians, and the apparent lack of interest from social services. They constantly bounce referrals back to the school to manage. It feels awful not being able to provide this little girl&apos;s family with the support they really need now  not in six weeks, or six months, or next year. I&apos;ve seen many children failed by this system, which is now dysfunctional. They are too traumatised for support; they are not traumatised enough for support. They are &quot;looked after&quot; by family, so aren&apos;t eligible for support. In some cases, the family won&apos;t accept the support that is offered, usually because they are too scared. Yet we must support these children and their families in school, and we do. Because if we didn&apos;t, the children would have no one fighting their corner, would not have opportunities for a different future. My primary school is set in an area of high deprivation, where many of the adults are illiterate, innumerate and have no aspiration for their children, and where there are generations who have not had a job. Schools like mine are no longer simply educational establishments. We are health centres, social care hubs, social security and housing advisers, counselling services, parenting practitioners and adult learning facilitators. We also teach children. We provide these services because if we didn&apos;t, the children and families would have no hope of breaking out of the cycle of deprivation they find themselves in. By supporting the children and families emotionally, we enable the children to access learning. We ensure that exclusions are kept to an absolute minimum. We are able, very slowly, to help some of the children to manage the school day without exploding. I have recently reintegrated a year 4 child whose behaviour was so extreme I seriously considered a permanent exclusion following a long string of serious incidents. The last time I saw him, he was tearing around the school delivering torrents of abuse. He was not responding to anyone  not even his mother, whom he was subjecting to the same stream of foul language. He seemed to be stuck in a tornado of rage and fury that swept him along, trying to destroy everything in his path: pens, pencils, people. I felt helpless, and it seemed at the time that there was no option other than to exclude him for a fixed term, which I did. I made alternative provision for him so that he would not miss out on any learning. It didn&apos;t work. His behaviour deteriorated there, and when he was back I excluded him again. It felt hopeless. His family circumstances were not helpful and, despite his mum&apos;s best efforts to be supportive, she simply didn&apos;t know what to do, and neither did I. So I took some thinking time. I was determined not to give up on him, to find a way to get him back on track. We have given him another chance. And he&apos;s taking it.",

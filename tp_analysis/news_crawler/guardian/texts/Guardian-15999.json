    "text": "The sun streams down on the bright-yellow laburnum blossom, carefully crafted conifers and even a row of potatoes around one immaculate suburban terrace garden in Middlefield Lane. It is a tranquil scene but one that is broken further along the road by an even brighter yellow triangle and other notices on a high, spiked fence, warning of an Explosive Atmosphere, and the presence of CCTV cameras and Cougar Security. Any children in the playground of Warren Wood community school who listened carefully might hear a gentle whistle and the odd clank as a &quot;nodding donkey&quot; lifts a modest 11 barrels of crude a day. This is Gainsborough 29, one of 250-300 wellheads at 150 sites across the country some of which have been discreetly producing oil for more than 50 years  and some of them right in the middle of densely populated suburbs, such as here in Lincolnshire. At a time when Britain is poised for a possible hydrocarbon rush thanks to shale gas, the inhabitants of the estate around Middlefield Lane and Park Springs Road, Gainsborough, could give some insight into the benefits or otherwise of living with petroleum production. Yet this area sees neither the heavy exploration-related traffic nor the cocktail of chemicals needed for fracturing shale rock. Two middle-aged women enjoying a lunch of rolls and crisps as the sun beats down wave away any suggestion that they are bothered by the diligent nodding donkey located just a few yards away. Equally, Philip Runham, a 41-year-old former refuse collector on his way into town, is happy to live next to Gainsborough 29. &quot;I&apos;ve only been here for 10 years and it&apos;s always been there. We don&apos;t talk about it. As long as it&apos;s nice and quiet it&apos;s all right with me,&quot; he says with a smile. Not everyone is entirely happy. Sixteen-year-old Callum Sanderson complains of smoke and smells in cold weather; his 11-year-old sister, Katie, says the facility &quot;bangs&quot; loudly at night; while Dawn, their mum, is annoyed about the fire alarm, which she says goes off every two weeks or so. &quot;They usually come out and fix it quite quickly but it&apos;s still annoying. But I&apos;m used to it. I&apos;ve lived [in this area] all my life. Katie was born here.&quot; These kinds of complaints are all taken seriously, insists Andrew Austin, founder and chief executive of IGas, the owner of Gainsborough 29 and more than 100 other similar sites around the East Midlands and north-west. &quot;We are very active in the community,&quot; he says from his office in Mayfair, London. &quot;Phone us up and talk to us about any of these issues and we will have someone out in an hour.&quot; Most of the alarms are directly wired into a local supply base, he points out, while the fields mainly have jet pumps these days, not nodding donkeys. &quot;Shale gas doesn&apos;t smell, either.&quot; The reference to shale is important because IGas is not just producing 3,000 barrels of oil a day from its conventional onshore oil fields in Britain; it is also at the sharp end of the new fracking fever. IGas put out new estimates this week of gas in place from its licence area in the Bowland Shale of the north-west of England, raising this to more than 100 trillion cubic feet (2.8tn cubic metres). This compared with a previous provisional assessment of less than 10tn cu ft, triggering a 10% jump in the company&apos;s share price. Analysts at Jefferies investment bank described the announcement as &quot;highly significant&quot;. Austin admits much more drilling must take place before IGas can be assured of its shale treasure but believes the &quot;resource density&quot; estimates of 300bn to 650bn cu ft per square mile are particularly significant. &quot;If we can get 30-50bcf per site, that is an awful lot of gas, especially if you compare that with the amount of land needed for a meaningful windfarm to produce the equivalent amount of power.&quot; Such arguments will excite a Treasury looking for more value for money compared with renewables  but not environmentalists who say the &quot;dash for gas&quot; will lock Britain into unsustainable CO2 emissions at a critical moment in the fight against global warming. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, dismisses the IGas estimates. &quot;Deciding how much gas there is based on the word of a shale gas firm is like buying a second-hand car without lifting up the bonnet and asking the price,&quot; he says. &quot;IGas may be keen to impress its investors in China but these figures are just hype. The world&apos;s largest oil and gas firms were attracted to Poland by similar claims  now they are rushing to leave.&quot; Such arguments have not dissuaded the country&apos;s largest gas and electricity supplier from finally trying to take the plunge. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, is in talks to buy into the Bowland Shale licence held by Cuadrilla Resources, a rival to IGas. The shale gas drillers say they still need tax breaks before they start in earnest trying to replicate the &quot;revolution&quot; that has driven down gas prices in the US. But their ultimate success will depend on a social licence to operate. Already blamed for causing earthquakes near Blackpool, the industry faces a tough challenge beating off the eco-critics. But with many of the prospective shale reserves not far from centres of population, winning the trust of people like Callum, Katie and Dawn will be even more important.",

    "text": "SONALI DE RYCKER Sonali De Rycker is a partner at Accel Partners in London. From offices around the world, Accel manages funds totalling $9bn. De Rycker&apos;s investments include Spotify, Wonga and Seatwave. What&apos;s good about the scene in London right now?  Silicon Valley has no monopoly on talent and innovation, but in London ambition has not always been as prominent as people like me would have liked. What&apos;s struck me in the last 18 months is that the level of ambition here is rising dramatically. What qualities are you looking for?  We like to back what we think will be the No 1 player in what we hope to be a disruptive and large category. We like companies that can be very big because we&apos;re a hits-driven business  make no mistake about that  and we take all the risks that come with that. What does it take to do your job?  Having a nose for the next big opportunity. Huge tenacity and hustle. Almost every single company we&apos;ve done well with has involved us chasing and hounding. Before I did this job, I thought you&apos;d just sit at your desk and wait for people to come to you. But we&apos;ve called companies 50 times before we even got to a second meeting.

The one I think really does define its category in an extremely innovative way is Wonga. And the one that got away? I really admire the team at SoundCloud. BRENT HOBERMAN Brent Hoberman, co-founder of lastminute.com, is investment partner at PROfounders Capital, an early stage 26m fund whose investments include easyCar, bespoke furniture site made.com and TweetDeck. He is also a non-executive director of Observer and Guardian publisher GMG. What do you do all day?  There&apos;s a lot of going out and finding new talent. One of the secrets is filtering which companies you meet with, because there are huge numbers you could meet. What&apos;s good about the scene in London?Startups are hot, people want to mix with them, bigger companies want to do deals with them. But a lot of the buzz is about the creative talent wanting to be in London.     Davor Hebel of Fidelity Growth Partners Europe, whose investment successes include InnoGames. Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/  Antonio Olmos    What qualities are you looking for?  It&apos;s got to be about passion and not about making a quick buck  I always get worried when I meet founders who are thinking about the exit right at the start. But the thing I get most excited about is disrupting industries that haven&apos;t yet been disrupted. What does it take to do your job?  If you&apos;ve gone through the rollercoaster of being an entrepreneur yourself that definitely helps you empathise with the people you invest in. Which investment are you proudest of?  I really like [home from home rental service] onefinestay, because it&apos;s not a copy of airbnb [the social accommodation network valued at $1bn], but an innovative take on that model. And the one that got away?  There are quite a lot of them. The main one is [black cab app] Hailo  the first time I used it I thought, How could we have passed on this?     Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital.

What do you do all day?  We spend our time finding deals, doing deals and managing our portfolio. For the first of those, we may identify 1,000 companies to do one deal. What qualities are you looking for?  We look for large markets undergoing fundamental transformation. After that, we look for great teams, good products and business models  companies that have actually built something that is differentiated. What does it take to do your job?  It&apos;s a combination of a few things: strategy, operational expertise, analytics and people skills. Sometimes you need to be bullish and really supportive of entrepreneurs. But ultimately, we are investors of capital  so we have to make a return. Which investment are you proudest of?  That&apos;s like choosing among your children. One I&apos;m very proud of is InnoGames, a German company whose founders dropped out of school to build a free-to-play game. They now have almost 50million registered users. And the one that got away?  Spotify. It was very early and very expensive when we met them. We loved the team, but it was a difficult business model. Now I think it could potentially be a $10bn company. EILEEN BURBIDGE  Eileen Burbidge is a partner at Passion Capital, an early stage or &quot;seed&quot; fund of 37.5m (25m of which is government money), whose investments include social micropayments site Flattr and GoCardless, an online payments service. What do you do all day?  It&apos;s pretty much meeting people  my partners, the founders of the companies we&apos;ve already invested in and getting a feel for entrepreneurs who are looking for investment from us. What&apos;s good about the scene in London?  There&apos;s just a huge amount of energy and excitement, which comes from things like the impending Facbook IPO, the Zynga and LinkedIn IPOs from last year, acquisitions like Instagram&apos;s by Facebook. All this helps to churn up a lot of activity and attention and this sense from startups of: &quot;We can do it as well anyone else.&quot; What qualities are you looking for?  It all comes down to the founders. How much passion, enthusiasm and tenacity they have. And their ability to assess what&apos;s happening in the market and adapt to those conditions. Which investment are you proudest of?  One we&apos;re very excited about is [academic research management system] Mendeley, which is disrupting a publishing market worth in excess of $25bn. And the one that got away?  Smartphone market research tool Qriously is a great team and proposition, but credit to them  they were able to secure a valuation beyond what we target for our seed investments.",

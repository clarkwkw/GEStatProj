    "text": "Sometimes, you just want to turn back the clock and try again. Square Enix clearly did with the spectacular but overly linear Final Fantasy XIII because Final Fantasy XIII-2 is all about jumping back and forth in time. We find ourselves once more on Gran Pulse, three years after the end of FF XIII. Lightning, the main character of that game, has vanished and only her sister, Serah, thinks this is odd. Thus begins a visually stunning and refreshingly open-world adventure, as Serah teams up with Noel, newly arrived from the future, to go and find her sister. Using mysterious portals, they start to leap all over space and time, largely in the order the player desires. This creates a fluid, organic and repeatable adventure, which will play havoc with your sense of time. Not everything is new; the excellentParadigm Shift battle systemremains. This deceptively complex interface is ridiculously easy,joyous even, to use. However, it can be fine-tuned endlessly, particularly now that tamed monsterscan join the party. These can be levelled up, and &quot;infused&quot; for mightier powers, as well as adornedwith cute if functionless accessories. Cuter still is the Moogle, a winged cat that helps out by transforming into a bow, being hurledat otherwise unreachable treasure and by carrying around a clock used to time your every battle. And this being a Final Fantasy game, every battle is a lot of battles. FF XIII-2 is a very successful time machine. Not only does it encourage the player constantly to move forward (even if that means going backwards in time), it takes the whole franchise back to the days when it was fun to play. And, like all the best Final Fantasy games, it devours the hours you spend with it.",

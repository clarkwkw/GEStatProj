    "text": "It was turning into the first truly hot day of the year, and the early morning mist had slowly morphed into a haze that softened the southern side of the valley. Only by referring to the map and lining up on the steeple of Leighton church could I make out where the hill fort of Beacon Ring was lurking in its dome of trees. In the completely still air, birdsong was the dominant sound. Following the path around the corner of the wood, I wondered how easy it would be to cross the stream that cut into the valley floor, and was pleased  if surprised  to find an elegant stone bridge. The hint that this route was once an important one was reinforced as I headed to the next ridge; the notch in the skyline, exactly at the logical crossing point, was eroded by the traffic of many years. The gentle slope was turfed with a sheep-cropped grass and clover sward, with rich greens that contrasted with the bare branches and grey bark of the woodland. Even this early in the season there were numerous earthworm casts on the surface. I picked one up and crushed the dry mass to powder between thumb and forefinger, feeling the smooth, silky sensation of the rich, silty soil. This was a good piece of land, well managed and utilised. Beyond it, an avenue of skeletal trees flanked the track across the hillside and down to the valley of the river Severn/Afon Hafren. From Belan Locks the Montgomery canal towpath offered an easy route back into Welshpool, bordered with clumps of celandine and willows laden with newly erupted buds. Unwilling to cut the day short, and fortified with excellent cheese scones bought earlier from the market, I chose the longer route through the deer park of Powis Castle. I was rewarded, as the shadows began to lengthen, with timeless views of the herd grazing on the hillside among the ancient standard trees  watching a stag bluster and fret in his constant vigil over his mates.",

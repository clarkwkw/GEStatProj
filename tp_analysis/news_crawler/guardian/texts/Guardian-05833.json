    "text": "    If you want to annoy a mathematician without investing much energy doing so, there&apos;s one question you can ask that will provide you with at least an hour of entertainment value: How big is a billion?   At first, this seems like a hair-splitting question that only big governments with giant war budgets or big banks with even bigger taxpayer-funded bailouts have to think about, but a billion is a number that has been redefined recently, and that has led to a bit of confusion as a result.  Two of our favourite mathematicians explain further:            [video link]  Which way were you taught? I was taught both the long and the short ways. Which means, of course, that I&apos;ve been perpetually confused as to what is a billion, and I&apos;ve especially been confused as to what the US National Debt is since it is referred to as &quot;billions&quot; or &quot;trillions&quot;. After awhile, these words lose their shock value, and simply blend into the background of increasing poverty and financial despair. So I&apos;ve always used scientific notation for large numbers because it was easier and less confusing.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

    "text": "Capcom&apos;s once-legendary horror series has languished in recent years, with newer instalments failing to recapture the macabre delights of earlier efforts. Revelations, originally a side project forthe portable 3DS, certainly lives up to its name, proving a surprise reminder of how great bio-terror games can be. Set largely on the abandoned cruise liner Queen Zenobia, Resi stalwart and hero Jill Valentine enjoys the spotlight, while others such as Chris Redfield also appear as the plot advances. A new terrorist organisation, Il Veltro, fulfils villainous duties, threatening to unleash a devastating new strain of the zombifying T-Virus. The claustrophobic corridors and shadowy depths of the abandoned ship are fantastically evocative of the tension of classic entries, while the return of more considered puzzles and scarce ammo makes the game more than just an endless shooting arcade. Thankfully, it&apos;s not just a &quot;best of&quot; of previous highlights. A scanning tool allows players to search surroundings for clues or data on enemy creatures, while new weapons, side characters and locations expand the game from the small-scale original. However, despite the high-def upgrade, Revelations remains clearly designed for a lower-spec machine, with unimpressive visuals and minimal variety of enemies. Nonetheless, a fine return to fearful form.",

    "text": "Four years ago, we setup the Guardian Environment Network to add the depth and knowledge of stories from established environment news sites and blogs to our coverage and share our journalism with them in return. Now, we&apos;re looking to emulate the success of the Guardian Science Blogs whose experts write on everything from astronomy to neuroscience  on environmentguardian. We want to give a platform to talented bloggers, new and experienced, to write about environmental stories on the Guardian with editorial support but with the freedom to choose what you want to write about.  We&apos;re especially interested in environment bloggers in Australia, Canada and the US, and the emerging economies, such as China and India. Subjects high on our list include resource extraction, climate change, activism, wildlife and conservation, pollution, energy, cleantech and green technology more broadly, deforestation, and green consumerism. If you&apos;d like to join us, just fill in the following form.  We&apos;d also like to hear from Guardian readers about great environment bloggers that should have a home on our site please let us know about your favourite reads and subscriptions in the comment thread (not the form) below.  The closing date for applications has now passed. We&apos;re reviewing the applications now and hope to contact those shortlisted soon",

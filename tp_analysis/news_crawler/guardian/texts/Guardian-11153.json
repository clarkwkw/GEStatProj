    "headline": "From famine to family planning; plus an update from Somali refugee Omar", 
    "text": "The year began with soul searching among the development community over its slow response to the famine in Somalia and the food crisis in the Horn of Africa, which came to attention in 2011. A report found that early warning systems were not acted on in good time. However, the UK aid watchdog said the Department for International Development (DfID) performed relatively well, despite acknowledging it could have been better prepared. Although famine in Somalia is now officially over, the situation in the country is still precarious, with the UN calling for $1.3bn for its country programme. Chronic food insecurity in the Sahel region of west Africa  brought about primarily by poor harvests and drought, and exacerbated by conflict  has been making headlines throughout the year. There were celebrations over news that the millennium development goal (MDG) of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water had been met early. However, the World Health Organisation and Unicef warned that millions of people were reliant on contaminated water supplies, and the MDG target on sanitation was way off track. Activists criticised the declaration from the World Water Forum for not defining water and sanitation as human rights. To coincide with the London Olympics, Britain&apos;s prime minister held a hunger summit to highlight the issue of malnourished children around the world. Hunger and nutrition are expected to be key topics at the G8 summit in June. Rio+20 was criticised by NGOs and civil society groups for its lack of concrete commitments. News that the outcome document was decided before any world leaders arrived in the Brazilian city fuelled the anger. But John Vidal argued the summit did produce some positive outcomes. One such result was the commitment to establish a working group to devise sustainable development goals that would feed into UN discussions on what comes after the 2015 MDGs deadline. Following Rio+20, the UN secretary general named the UK prime minister and the presidents of Liberia and Indonesia as co-chairs of a high-level panel charged with framing a post-2015 development agenda. The panel met for the first time in November and is expected to convene again in January and March, before producing a report in May. In the summer, the UK hosted a global summit on family planning to raise political commitment and resources. The summit resulted in pledges of $2.6bn over the next eight years to provide access to contraceptives for millions of women in poor countries. UK aid came under close scrutiny, after DfID figures showed that the majority of its contracts were awarded to consultants in the UK. The department, which spent more than 500m on consultants in 2011, launched an inquiry but has refused to publish the findings. The new international development secretary, Justine Greening, announced that the UK would not give aid to India after 2015. She suspended budget support to Rwanda over its alleged support for the M23 rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and froze direct aid to the Ugandan government over allegations of fraud.

Update on Omar In February, we reported on Omar, a Somali teenager who was living in a refugee camp in Tunisia but was about to leave for a new life in Sweden. In a second film, we followed his journey from the camp to Sandviken. Film-maker Nick Francis (who also made our new Joyce Banda documentary) spoke to Omar last week. Omar said:  Everything is great here. The people are very kind and welcoming. Every morning I go to school and I can speak a little Swedish now. After school I spend lots of time in the library studying. As soon as I can speak Swedish, I hope to be able to get a job. My friends are well. We are staying together in the same place. Some other friends from Chusha camp went to the city of Malmo. I have not left Sandviken since arriving here. Right now, it&apos;s very cold, you can&apos;t go outside. It is the first time I have seen snow. When I lived in Africa, I only ever saw snow on the TV  when I saw it here I became happy. But I didn&apos;t know how to walk on ice and fell over the first time I had to walk on it on the way to school.  What you said Readers have contributed some lively comments on the site over the past year. John Vidal sparked debate with his report on how food shortages could turn us into vegetarians. Among more than 1,000 comments, CordwainerBird said:  Going vegetarian may address the issue of feeding an increased population but an extra 2 billion people will stress the supply of many other consumables too, everything from energy to electrical components  Few shed any tears over the end of UK aid to India, either in response to our article or on our readers&apos; poll. Darkati said:  While it&apos;s purely the UK government&apos;s decision, as an Indian I feel aid is really not required any longer. If I were the UK government decisionmaker, I would reduce aid gradually  and end it gracefully over a period of time, rather than an abrupt stop  bluezoo said:  Trade has by far and away the biggest impact for growth in developing countries. The UK should ensure: 1) trade supports the growth of local economies in developing countries rather than simply becoming an exploitative process for western pockets  primarily through its own practices, but also through lobbying within the WTO, the EU and OECD organs; 2) trade relations are based on supporting good governance and democratic freedoms, and human rights  We&apos;ve also had a good response from readers to our talk points, including on the future of Somalia and the greatest water challenges. Readers&apos; pictures posted in our Flickr group were turned into galleries, including one with your messages for the Rio+20 summit.

    "text": "For many years the first experiment undergraduate physics students arriving in Cambridge were required to do was to measure g, the acceleration due to gravity. This was, in principle, an easy experiment to do, the apparatus simple and the &quot;correct&quot; answer of 9.81 ms2 known to each and every one of them. How could it go wrong? The catch was that they were asked to measure this quantity with an accuracy of 1 part in 1,000  in other words, to get that second decimal place right. In practice, very few of them managed to get their experiments (using a compound pendulum) working that precisely. Values of over 10 ms2 were far from uncommon, although generally that was because they&apos;d forgotten how to use a calculator because of the stress of the unfamiliar and daunting new surroundings; or maybe they&apos;d been up all night getting to know their new college neighbours over a few drinks. The primary aim of the experiment was to teach the students about errors: where they turn up and their different manifestations. Since the experiment had intrinsically various sources of error, they also had to get to grips with how to deal with accounting for them all adequately; they needed to be able to estimate whether or not they had got close to the requested &quot;1 part in 1,000&quot; accuracy. It was combining the errors that used to throw the students more than anything else, leading to some of their answers being so wildly wrong. Beyond actually doing these calculations, the conceptual take-home message we wanted to convey was the difference between systematic and random errors, since these turn up all over the place  in practice way beyond the undergraduate physics laboratory. Random errors are the ones with which people tend to be familiar. In this particular experiment, involving timing the swing of a pendulum accurately, there is an obvious source of error arising from how fast your reflexes are and how accurately you can judge the precise moment at which to stop the stopwatch at the end of one swing. Timing over more swings reduces the contribution of this random error to the precision with which the fundamental quantity, the period of a single swing, can be determined. As long as the stopwatch is accurate, that should be that. But when it came to the distance measurements, all we supplied were crude wooden metre rules that were often rather beaten up by previous generations of students  maybe they were warped, maybe worn away at the ends so that the first millimetre was missing. In this case, as well as the random error, a systematic error could be present which, however many times they did the measurement and however meticulously, would lead to inaccuracy if not taken into account. These sorts of error are pernicious if not spotted; they are also depressingly common. The story about &quot;faster than light neutrinos&quot; earlier this year was a case in point. As soon as the Italian team published their apparently extraordinary results, admittedly with many warnings that they feared there might be an undetected problem with the data, everyone started looking for where a systematic error might lurk.  It could have been in the measurement of the precise distance between the source of the neutrinos and the data collection point  a total distance of around 730km. If this distance had been mismeasured by a mere 20 metres (one part in 40,000), the result could have been rationalised.  In fact the source of the problem turned out to be a combination of two electronic faults: a dodgy connection causing the time measured to be shorter than it should have been, partially compensated by the oscillator underpinning the timing ticking slightly too slowly, lengthening the time by a small amount. These two effects led to a small but ever-present error in the timing. Repeating the experiment many times made no difference, which was why the team were misled into believing the neutrinos really might be travelling faster than light. They felt they had checked everything carefully before they went public. In fact they hadn&apos;t.  As I say, such systematic errors are pernicious and ubiquitous. In this case it also cost the team leader his job. But systematic errors turn up away from physics experiments in ways that can also trick the unwary. Academics and universities are constantly being &quot;measured&quot; in various ways. These measurements are as likely to be systematically inaccurate as any other, yet they can imply a spurious accuracy that can in turn affect both policy and funding.  For instance, the distribution of money between university teaching and research is based in part on the responses from academics to a Time Analysis Survey. The aims are laudable, the motivations of academics no doubt equally so, and yet no one is actually going to sit down and attribute each moment of the day precisely; indeed it would be totally impracticable to do so.  As a result, numbers are produced with random errors arising from uncertainty as to how different tasks fit under the different headings (of which there are many) and because it&apos;s hard to account accurately for exactly how long was spent on each. But there are also systematic errors present because (since we as academics don&apos;t count very precisely) we may round up and down in different ways for different tasks because of what we internally expect we should be doing. As for those frequent league tables ranking universities  within the UK or internationally  these have a different kind of systematic error in so far as you really have to read the small print to know what is actually being measured. As a result, with several newspapers producing their own ranking, it is possible for most Russell Group universities to be able to say they are in the top 10 in one list or the other.  Internationally, one much quoted example  which university administrations may put much store by  is the Shanghai Jiao Tong, a league table that is heavily weighted towards research. It includes factors such as the number of university Nobel prizewinners, but basically doesn&apos;t take into account the quality of teaching provided and other factors important to incoming students such as expenditure on libraries. It won&apos;t, therefore, be really very useful for an aspiring undergraduate to use. But they may well not appreciate that the things they care about are systematically absent, if they simply look at the headlines. My message is simple: when reading figures that look convincing and precise, you should always stop and question what, if anything, is missing. The need for accountability by government from the higher education sector means collectively we are constantly being measured in ways that may or may not have any precision.  For a warped metre rule, it is easy enough to carry out a calibration against a steel ruler much more resistant to distortion and destruction than the wood. For many other situations, no such simple remedy exists.",

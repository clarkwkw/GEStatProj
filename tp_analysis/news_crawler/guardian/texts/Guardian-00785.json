    "text": "    Lucy Siegle is one of the UK&apos;s most recognisable opinion forming journalists on environmental issues. She has been an Observer columnist since 2004 and also contributes features and comment pieces. Her mission is to re-brand ecology and wider environmental issues as relevant and accessible and she launched the Observer Ethical Awards in 2005.  Her work is underpinned by rigorous research and scientific debate (she does not believe in the healing power of crystals). After guest slots on BBC Breakfast, Newsnight and Live Earth, her playful authority was spotted by the makers of The One Show, BBC1 in June 2007 and she was commissioned to present five films on recycling. She quickly established herself as a regular reporter, and has now made countless topical, current affairs and eco related films for the show and appears regularly in studio.  In 2008 she was appointed Visiting Professor to University of the Arts London in recognition of her work in building an ethical fashion industry.",

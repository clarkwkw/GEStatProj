    "text": "Branches of blossom peep above yew hedges that separate Cotehele&apos;s formal gardens from the old orchard. The apple is particularly thick and gorgeous this year. It obscures mistletoe, and clothes limbs that until a few weeks ago were bare apart from lichen and moss. Most spectacular is the luminous Sid Coombe No1  a spreading tree planted here 25 years ago. Genetic testing has proved this variety to be unique, so it goes by the name of the farmer who valued the original tree on his smallholding near the River Inny (a tributary of the Tamar). In the warmth, after an early grass frost, petals from this tree and the Beauty of Bath float on to dandelion clocks, timothy grass and sky-blue speedwell, but a succession of opening blooms should prolong the season for pollination by bees from the nearby hives. The Wintergreen is late flowering and on the Improved Keswick are dark pink buds and full-out flowers tinged with rose. Pale blossom on the Queenie is unlike its apples, which will be of a crimson akin to the startling blossom of the Pendragon. Outside this enclave, the extensive &quot;mother orchard&quot; was planted by the National Trust in 2007 with varieties from the local fruit collection of Mary Martin and James Evans (my sister and brother-in-law). Twigs had been grafted on to vigorous M25 stock that will form large trees as well as MM106, which will be smaller but produce fruit sooner. Annual pruning has established frameworks of branches on sturdy trunks. Some, including the Polly Whitehair, Cornish Gilliflower, Pear Apple, Pengelly and Banana Pippin, are in flower  portents of the longed-for frothy avenues. For now this widely spaced planting is open and exposed to Kit Hill and the western skyline. The honeybees have not ventured out here into the wind, and bumblebees forage on comfrey in the more sheltered garden. Beyond adjoining pastures and fields of green barley, in the woods, orangey leaves of oak and the lime-green of beech crowns are brilliantly sunlit, like beacons against the darkening sky.",

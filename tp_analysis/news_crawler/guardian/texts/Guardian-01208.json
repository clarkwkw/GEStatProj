It&apos;s the dead of winter, all the beautiful white snow is now yellow-and-brown slush, most New Year&apos;s resolutions have already been broken, the bills from the recent holiday spending orgy have arrived in the mail so money is tight, and rent is due and, and ... oh yeah, today is my birthday.  I&apos;ve never been very eager to mention it to anyone because, well, my birthday has nearly always been quite depressing (or completely overlooked), particularly when I was a child. But I still had secret birthday wishes anyway. If I could have anything as a gift, I once again am wishing for a visit to New Guinea -- a visit that should, ideally, last at least a few weeks (and should, ideally, require one year of preparation, I think). However, as always, a visit to New Guinea is rather unlikely, so I have an alternative birdday wish. Even though I am not a fan of cakes (I prefer pies), as soon as I saw this video documenting the making of a very special cake, I was instantly enchanted: creating this would be the most perfect birdday gift for this (or any) evolutionary biologist, don&apos;t you think?    Of course, I&apos;d just have to help create this cake (because that&apos;s 9/10 of the fun, of course!) and then I&apos;d need three or four dozen of my bestest friends in the whole wide world to help me eat it!

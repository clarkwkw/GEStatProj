    "text": "Polly Toynbee&apos;s comment (This lost generation will cost us more than the cuts save, 3 July) that &quot;Colleges that do so well at setting people on good careers with opportunities fall beneath his [Michael Gove&apos;s] interest&quot; applies to most secretaries of state for education and most MPs. Few have visited further education colleges; fewer have studied in one. Public comment about education always implies schools or universities; FE colleges are rarely mentioned. They cater for almost 9million people of all ages and abilities in the UK and, despite disparities in funding, give unique opportunities for further study and careers which are not provided by either schools or universities. Their student support and quality and monitoring systems are often a model of excellent practice  one which many universities would do well to emulate. Government spending cuts, which have removed financial support, deny young students opportunities to continue their studies. This is misguided in the extreme. With few jobs available, they can only become unemployed, a drain on the public purse and socially disadvantaged. But what would you expect from millionaire cabinet ministers with no experience of the real world of work, whose earnings are far in excess of what any of these young people could hope to earn? Perhaps ministers will only realise the social damage they have done when they can&apos;t find a plumber, electrician or builder. But by then it will be too late!Barry Gregson-AllcottDolgellau, Gwynedd  I had hoped that Peter Scott&apos;s opinion (Education, 3 July) that so-called &quot;elite&quot; universities would now become &quot;finishing schools for gilded youth&quot; was unduly pessimistic. Only two days later, however, I spotted an announcement that a professor in my former department is to become a visiting scholar at Eton College for a term. The same department has already established a collaborative project with Winchester College. Sheer coincidence? Or is the vice-chancellor concerned  who is to be, incidentally, the next chair of the Russell Group  already encouraging his staff to position themselves for a gilded future?Dr Maureen BellNewark, Nottinghamshire",

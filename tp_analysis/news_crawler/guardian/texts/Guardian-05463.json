    "text": "Renowned throughout the world as a celebration of games culture, Nottingham&apos;s GameCity festival will be returning this year. Launched on Wednesday night by industry veteran Ian Livingstone, the event will take place over a full week, rather than the usual four days, and is set to feature its own school dedicated to game design. At the top of the bill, perhaps, is festival newbie Peter Molyneux who will be curating a whole day of events, celebrating his past and future games, as well as analysing his influences.  &quot;We&apos;ve been doing a videogame culture event for seven years now, and it&apos;s impossible not to notice the big, Peter Molyneux shaped hole in it,&quot; says GameCity director, Iain Simons. &quot;There&apos;s a list of people that we really want to come to the festival, and Peter was at the top of it for this year. The shocking thing for me to be honest, was that the ask and the confirmationwere all done within about 15 minutes worth of emailing.&quot; It seems the perfect time for Molyneux to be involved. The creator of Populous, Black&amp;White and Dungeon Keeper has recently left the Microsoft-owned Lionhead Studios to set up his own company, 22Cans.  &quot;The Peter Molyneux [festival goers will] see is one who is completely independent, infectiously enthusiastic and in his creative prime,&quot; says Simons. &quot;I&apos;ve promised him that I won&apos;t reveal any of the ideas we kicked around, but I can assure you that they will be untroubled by creative or practical restraint. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m giving too much away though, to say that you might need to bring Wellington boots along and some waterproof clothing.&quot; The GameCity STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) school will run throughout the festival in the main market square tent, offering members of the public various lessons in game design. Teachers will include Martin Hollis, the co-creator of classic N64 shooter GoldenEye, and Jonathan Smith of Lego games creator, TT Games.  Elsewhere, there will be celebrations for the 30th anniversary of the Commodore 64 computer. &quot;They are going to be AMAZING,&quot; enthuses Simons. &quot;We&apos;re hoping to bring together all of the C64 veterans we can find, to stage the best reunion event ever  most likely forming the basis for a triumphant return to the Mogal-E-Azam restaurant where the Jeff Minter retrospective &apos;Goat in the Machine&apos; was staged back in 2004.  &quot;Obviously the National Videogame Archive are going to be heavily involved, so the creation of a whole raft of new Director Commentary events seems like a given.&quot; Other plans for the C64 event include a special one-off edition of classic magazine ZZap 64, written by members of the original editorial team. Simons is also hoping to encourage 8bit music legend Martin Galway, composer of some of the finest game soundtracks of all time, to create a new SID chip tune for the festival. Gamesblog is backing this admirable campaign. Gamecity 7 will take place between 20-27 October at various venues around Nottingham town centre. Clear some space in your diary.

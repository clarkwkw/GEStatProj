Early details suggest the system is codenamed &apos;Piston&apos; and will be coloured in the familiar charcoal grey associated with Valve&apos;s software. Valve&apos;s Steam, specifically its Big Picture Mode for TVs, will likely be pre-installed onto the Linux based operating system.   1TB, eight (eight?) USB ports, HDMI out. Basically, a headless PC. Qualcomm&apos;s insane CES 2013 keynote in pictures and tweets &gt;&gt; The Verge Who knew that people would dream of the sane, rational days of Steve Ballmer keynotes? Telecoms pricing &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans  Ofcom (the UK media and telecoms regulator) compiles a chart like this every year, showing pricing for a range of different user case baskets to get access to telecoms and media services around the world. Somewhat conveniently, it shows the UK as cheapest (mainly due to the slightly over-competitive mobile market), but it is also interesting to see how expensive the US market tends to come out in these sorts of comparisons.   The US might think it&apos;s doing great in this space; in fact it&apos;s doing poorly. The same applies to broadband pricing. Steve Ballmer confirms Windows Phones sales 5 times faster than last year over Christmas &gt;&gt; WMPoweruser  Using our old stand-in, Facebook Monthly Active Users, we can also easily confirm that many more new Windows Phone users joined the club in the last quarter of 2012, and in December 2012 six times more new FB MAU were added than in Q4 2012.   The MAU figure works because most people who use WinPhone connect it to their Facebook account. However, as Ballmer didn&apos;t say what the figure was last year, one has to estimate: WMPoweruser reckons 11.1m for the quarter. Apple working on a less-expensive iPhone &gt;&gt; WSJ.com  Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone, according to people briefed on the matter, a big shift in its corporate strategy as its supremacy in smartphones has slipped.  While Apple has explored such a device for years, the plan has been progressing and a less expensive version of its flagship device could launch as soon as later this year, one of the people said.   &quot;Could resemble the standard iPhone...&quot; but with polycarbonate plastic. Certainly, analysts have thought that Apple ought to do an &quot;iPhone mini&quot; for years (try a search on that term). But would it be sold just to countries where Apple wants to make a big impression, such as China? It hardly needs to push its share in the US. Making your kitchen cool &gt;&gt; BBC Sci/Tech News Yes, you&apos;ve read this before, but..   This has got to be the coolest gadget yet for the kitchen: a fridge freezer that is hooked up to the Internet.  Screenfridge, as it is called, allows you to send and receive e-mail, watch television, pay bills and handle personal banking. You can also keep food in it.   Wait: see if you can guess which year (and, for bonus points, month) this story appeared. PC prices must rise, not fall, to solve Windows 8&apos;s lousy start, analyst argues &gt;&gt; Computerworld  The holiday slump in PC sales - down 11% compared to 2011 - means that PC makers must raise prices, not continue a race to the bottom, an analyst argued today.  Windows 8 failed to turn around slumping PC sales during the recently-concluded holidays, final data from US retailers showed, confirming earlier estimates.  The answer, said Steven Baker of the NPD Group: Raise prices.  &quot;This [fall in sales] had to happen,&quot; Baker said in a Monday interview, referring to the unsustainable razor-thin margins and the continual rush to undercut competitors&apos; pricing. &quot;Even if Windows 8 had been a warmed-over Windows 7, [OEMs] would still have been beaten up,&quot; Baker said of a counter-factual where Microsoft just kept doing what it had been doing, and declined to turn Windows in a different direction.   Surely netbooks - and all the other evidence - demonstrates that the variable demand for Windows PCs is price-elastic. (There&apos;s a base demand that is unlinked to price because it&apos;s giant corporate buyers.) So raising prices means lower demand. CES 2011: Samsung had one of the craziest, most secretly impressive keynotes at CES &gt;&gt; Business Insider From 2011:   Last night Samsung delivered an incredibly odd, but impressive keynote on the future of television.  The keynote was led by Boo-Keun Yoon, president of Samsung&apos;s TV business.  But really, a weird tween named &quot;Zoll,&quot; was the host for the evening, introducing each topic. There were also dance routines.   The comments section on that post is... intriguing in its eagerness.  You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

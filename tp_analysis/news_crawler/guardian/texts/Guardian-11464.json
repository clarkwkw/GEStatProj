    "text": "Mario games aren&apos;t famed for being complicated, story-driven affairs. Which is why the Paper Mario series is a bit of anomaly. It&apos;s an RPG franchise that prides itself on in-jokes, charming characters and a quirky art style akin to a pop-up book. Sticker Star is no different, filled with bizarre characters who gently mock the tropes of Mario games, while boasting visuals that look particularly impressive in 3D. Here, they tell the story of the Sticker Comet, which has been unwittingly destroyed by Bowser. The task, then, is for Mario to set about finding the pieces of the Sticker Comet, utilising the stickers to beat enemies and solve puzzles. It&apos;s certainly novel, but the puzzles  which include placing stickers on the landscape to build bridges  are largely superficial. And the turn-based battle mechanics, which involve using fire flower, jumping boot or hammer stickers to topple foes, have just removed the need for Mario to learn moves. There are no experience points to gain either, which makes fighting feel pointless and so players will just avoid confrontation most of the time. Sticker Star is by no means a bad game, and there&apos;s certainly fun to be had here, but by simplifying the RPG mechanics, it just doesn&apos;t quite match up to its deeper, more satisfying predecessors.",

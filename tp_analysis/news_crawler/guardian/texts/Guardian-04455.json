    "text": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Once deemed evil, Google now embraces &quot;paid inclusion&quot; &gt;&gt; Marketing Land  Having previously declared paid inclusion to be evil, can it really be that Google is doing it now? Yes, though Google&apos;s not been using that name, and it also really didn&apos;t become apparent until last month.  Google Hotel Finder and Google Flight Search were both launched last year. On the surface, they seem like Google&apos;s other &quot;vertical&quot; or topic-focused search engines, such as Google Images, Google News or Google Shopping, which allow you to search for certain specific types of information.  Unlike Google&apos;s other vertical search engines, however, payment seems to have a role in being included in Google Hotel Finder and Google Flight Search. Maybe Google will find your hotel or your flight and list it for &quot;free.&quot; But it seems more likely you&apos;ll appear if you have a paid relationship.   There are &quot;sponsored&quot; blobs, but not explanations of in what way results are &quot;sponsored&quot;. Windows 8 - Who moved my desktop? &gt;&gt; getwired.com Wes Miller, research VP at Directions on Microsoft (a Microsoft-watching consultancy):   When I look at Windows 8 today, I see an operating system that is trying so hard to be a tablet operating system that, in some ways, it has compromised it&apos;s integrity as a desktop operating system (whereas Windows 7 was a very good desktop operating system that offered very limited value for tablet-based computing).  I worry that in the melee of transforming Windows to be so tablet-centric OS, Microsoft may in fact convince people that an iPad is all that they need to get their job done.  Did Microsoft just give up on Windows 8 for businesses? &gt;&gt; Winsupersite Paul Thurrott is worried:   Virtually all of the major new features in Windows 8 -- the new Windows Runtime, the Metro environment with its full-screen apps, and the all-new developer APIs that drive it all -- are derived solely from the mobile world and Microsoft&apos;s experiences building Windows Phone for smartphones. Microsoft expects a significant percentage of Windows 8 users to touch their PCs and, now, devices, and not interact with them using traditional keyboards and mice.  Will any of them be business users?  Tim Cook at the D Conference: Between the Lines &gt;&gt; Dan Frommer  When an ABC News journalist asked Cook about Ping, Apple&apos;s music-related social network-of-sorts, he said &quot;I don&apos;t think we have to own a social network.&quot; He continued: &quot;But does Apple need to be social? Yes.&quot; Then he gave the examples of Apple integrating Twitter into iOS and OS X, its iMessage and Game Center services, etc. &quot;We tried Ping, and I think the customer voted and said &apos;This isn&apos;t something that I want to put a lot of energy into.&apos;&quot;  Then, when Kara Swisher joked that Cook should sell Ping to Google+, Cook laughed very hard.  Infographic: sweet Jesus, the patent war has gotten crazy &gt;&gt; Fastco.Design  The sheer visual mass of this image will likely give you pause--which I think is entirely the point--but let me help you decode it. The companies are arranged in a circle. A simple arrow points from each company to the company they&apos;re suing. And in many cases, these arrows are firing back and forth at one another in what reminds me of a worst case scenario Cold War map in which half the earth is obliterated into space dust.   An earlier version appeared about 18 months ago in the Guardian. Since then it&apos;s gotten worse. A Facebook phone might be a great Idea - right now &gt;&gt; Forbes  Using a cheap and fast Chinese or Taiwanese subcontractor to crank out a smooth smartphone that retails for 300 reals in Brazil can be done. It is up to Facebook to ensure that the software is far superior to what Amazon was able to manage with Kindle Fire...  There is now a gaping hole in the low-end smartphone market to be exploited. Nokia, RIMM and LG are stumbling simultaneously and HTC has not been effective in targeting budget buyers.  Mary Meeker&apos;s 2012 Internet Trends presentation &gt;&gt; Kleiner Parker Caufield &amp; Byers If you haven&apos;t heard of Mary Meeker: she&apos;s formerly an analyst, presently a venture capitalist at KPCB, and her annual internet survey is obligatory reading. Oh hey, Motorola and RIM Called: they want to go back to 2004 and try again &gt;&gt; The Atlantic But whatever: The 1.3 million Blackberry subscribers of 2004 were power players. They were ballers. They answered emails with simple replies: &quot;Fire the missiles!&quot; or &quot;Sell! Sell! Sell!&quot; or &quot;Coffee&apos;s for closers.&quot; They were not mere mortals tethered to desktop computers and lame keyboards. They could send emails from steakhouses. My, how the might have fallen. US customs approves HTC shipments &gt;&gt; FT.com  For HTC, the damage from the delays to its new One X and EVO 4G LTE models could have been significant, said analysts, as the current second quarter is key to its efforts to win back market share lost to Samsung and Apple. Had the delay been longer, the handsets could have been pitched more directly in competition with Apple&apos;s new iPhone 5 and Samsung&apos;s new Galaxy S3, both expected in the US later this year.  However, the delay of just two weeks is unlikely to hurt sales significantly or cause a supply shortage in the US, said Roxy Wong, an analyst with Mirae Asset Securities.

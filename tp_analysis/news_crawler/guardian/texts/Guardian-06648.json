    "text": "Michael Gove&apos;s announcement that AS-levels might be scrapped has pleased those who think students should be free to pursue outside interests such as sports and drama. This recognition that there&apos;s fun, fulfilment and learning to be had outside the classroom could hardly be more welcome to sixth formers under pressure. Of course good grades are crucial if you want to go to university (a big &quot;if&quot; for some students), but the two years you spend studying for them is also the perfect time to broaden your interests. Extra-curricular pursuits are wide ranging and some students already have a passion or a skill that they want to hone. Some choose to perform, whether as actors, singers, rappers or spoken word poets. Chloe L acknowledges that though her parents initially encouraged her to take up dancing, the decision to continue was based on herlove for the art form. She says she&apos;s&quot;often left the stage and cried, because the adrenaline is incredible&quot;. Chloe dedicated considerable time to pursue herpassionthroughout secondary school and now trains at a specialist dance college. Others balance personal interests with academic commitments. Tom, who plays guitar, recently found out that he&apos;ll be one of several young musicians performing as part of the Olympics celebrations in London. He says that &quot;music is more important [than academic work] as it&apos;s my future career; although my music A-level course plays a large role in this. I don&apos;t find it a challenge to balance both as they often tend to complement each other.&quot; Solitary creative endeavours such as writing, photography and art are also popular, while many adolescents give up time and energy through volunteering projects. Tegan has volunteered with CSV (Community Service Volunteers) for the past two years on the Sex Matters project, an initiative encouraging the prevention of STIs and teenage pregnancy. &quot;I wanted to volunteer to make a positive contribution to society,&quot; she says. &quot;Before, I wasn&apos;t going to school and was in trouble with the police. I wanted to do something meaningful but also to develop employable skills.&quot; Another popular activity is sport, either locally or competitively. Emma recently set a new British Record for discus throwing in her age category, and balances her school work with training and contests. &quot;Sometimes I do find it hard to balance [my] sport and college work. If I need to, I do cut out training sessions to catch up on work, [because] education will get me further in life,&quot; she explains. An unusual choice of hobby means that Chloe H is currently the youngest hot air balloon pilot in the UK, gaining her licence on her seventeenth birthday. She says it&apos;s something she &quot;just couldn&apos;t imagine not doing.&quot; Her parents both fly balloons and she&apos;s been involved with the industry from an early age, learning the skills as she accompanied them to events. Despite the hours it took to gain her licence, she says that &quot;college always came first&quot;, but having to balance competing priorities meant she always felt tugged by one or the other. Everyone interviewed says that managing to combine their academic work with outside interests takes sustained self-discipline and commitment. It puts a different slant on the image of young people promoted daily in the media, where adolescents make headlines only in relation to violence or exam results. Author of teenage fiction Patrick Ness in his recent Carnegie address suggested that &quot;the worst thing our present government and, in fact, we as a culture do about teenagers is that we think of them almost entirely in negative terms.&quot; There&apos;s little space given tothose described by Ness as being the &quot;sensitive, smart, compassionate, funny, questioning, brilliant people they&apos;ve always been&quot;. Such adjectives seem particularly appropriate to young people who are self-motivated, hard-working and willing to engage with ideas and possibilities beyond the curriculum  whatever area their achievements fall into.",

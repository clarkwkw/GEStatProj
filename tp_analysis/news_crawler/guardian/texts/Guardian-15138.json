    "text": "During its opening moments, Thomas Was Alone feels a little familiar, taking the well-established form of an abstract puzzle-based platformer. Quickly, though, it becomes clear that this fascinating title, originally a cult release from the UK&apos;s indie games scene, is also blessed with sublime level design and huge imagination. As the player guides a series of polygonal forms with distinct abilities through elegant geometric landscapes, both the mechanics and game concepts are reinvented and reworked. But level design, striking visuals and sumptuous audio are not its greatest assets. What sets it apart are the themes and the stories, all delivered in a well-written script brilliantly narrated by Danny Wallace. As the game unfolds the polygons develop personalities, wrangling with concepts such as self-image, individual purpose and acceptance of difference. It&apos;s a remarkable achievement.",

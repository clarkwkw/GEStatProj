Because humans are altering and destroying natural bird habitat, it is only reasonable to expect that we should try to mitigate this damage by providing food for them. Unfortunately, rodents, particularly squirrels, are taking advantage of this situation, which then creates an arms race between devoted bird feeders and these pesky (and often invasive alien) mammals.  This amateur Caturday morning video smile captures the action of one of many devices used to discourage squirrels from eating all the seed that humans put out for birds:               Visit viteacher&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  This squirrel is known to the videographers &quot;Hardiman&quot; because of his skills at clinging to a birdfeeder equipped with a twirl-a-squirrel. Hardiman survived this encounter in good health and even managed to run down the driveway in a straight line.  NOTE: I did not receive anything from anyone for featuring this video here. No books, no money, no birdseed. Nothing. Okay, I did receive one benefit, my morning was filled with giggles as I put this blog entry together. In fact, both my parrots and I found this video to be uproariously hilarious. And anything that makes my birds laugh automatically passes my &quot;Caturday morning video smile&quot; test.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist evil google+: grrlscientist email: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

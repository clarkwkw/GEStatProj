    "text": "An opening quote from Dante Alighieri indicates the themes to be explored in the game that follows  a thoughtful theological premise that represents both the greatest strength and weakness of Datura. The game itself is tough to portray in mere words  it&apos;s as ethereal and bizarre as the deceptively pretty hallucinogenic flower from which it takes its name. After a strange intro where you&apos;re guided into self-administering a seemingly fatal shock, you awake in a forest. Wandering around without any hints as to place or purpose, the primary challenge seems to be finding white trees dotted around, filling in a hand-drawn map while doing so. Interacting with the oddities dotted around changes things, though. You&apos;ll find yourself on a road, in an ice field, trying to escape an eerie house. People flit around, just out of sight. Played in first person, it&apos;s incredibly immersive and unsettling, an experience bolstered by a wonderful soundscape. Unfortunately, Datura never quite matches up to its own highbrow expectations  it tries too hard to be unusual and leave its questions unanswered, preferring instead to be weird for weirdness&apos; sake. The game is also hampered by shoddy gameplay  neither the PlayStation controller nor the Move wand make exploring the spooky woodlands fun. A short game, it encourages players to run through a few times to get the fullest experience and see how different choices play out, but its poor controls are likely to make that more of a chore.",

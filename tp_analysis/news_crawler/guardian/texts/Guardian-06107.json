    "text": "The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has called on leaders, business and civil society to step up efforts to end hunger. Launching a Zero Hunger Challenge at Rio+20 on Thursday, Ban emphasised that an estimated 1 billion people still go to bed hungry each day, saying food security was a top priority. Endorsing the challenge, the UK&apos;s deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said Britain would be allocating 150m from the international climate change fund to support about 6 million farmers, particularly in Niger and Ethiopia. The money will be channelled through the adaptation for smallholder agriculture programme to help farmers adapt to the impact of climate change. &quot;We can&apos;t rest while so many people are hungry in the world while there&apos;s enough food for all,&quot; said Ban. &quot;Somehow this food is not distributed equally or fairly. Some people are living in prosperity while marginalised people are hungry. We know this has to change.&quot; Ban praised the previous efforts of the Brazilian government to reduce poverty and hunger through its Fome Zero programme, launched in 2004. The initiative has lifted millions of people out of poverty by supporting local farmers and community kitchens and introducing social welfare policies such as the Bolsa Familia scheme. The man who designed the Brazilian programme, Graziano da Silva, is now director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which is supporting the UN campaign, along with the International Fund for Agriculture (Ifad), the World Food Programme (WFP), Unicef, the World Bank and Bioversity International. The campaign has five objectives: 100% access to food for all, all year round; an end to stunting among children under two because of a lack of nutrients during pregnancy and in the early days of life; ensuring food systems are sustainable (although there is no reference to how this could be achieved); doubling smallholder productivity and income; and a reduction in food waste, at the farmer level, through lack of suitable storage and among consumers. A third of food is lost or wasted. It makes no mention of changing the food systems. No deadline has been set for achieving these aims. &quot;I&apos;m not proposing a new world, I&apos;m sharing a vision for the future where all people enjoy a fundamental right to food,&quot; said Ban. At the launch, Mahamadou Issoufou, the president of Niger, which is experiencing severe drought and facing food shortages, said the problem his country faces is lack of resources to support agriculture. &quot;We need agricultural materials, and we need pesticides, we need lots of things,&quot; he said. &quot;We would like to help our farmers produce more and help protect them when there is a catastrophe. When that happens, we have help through the emergency response from international organisations, but we should not give them a fish, but teach them how to fish.&quot; The Rio+20 draft outcome document mentions the need to &quot;address the root causes of excessive food price volatility&quot; and manage the risks associated with high and volatile commodity prices for global food security and nutrition and smallholder farmers.

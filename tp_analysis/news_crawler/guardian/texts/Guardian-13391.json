    "text": "There seems to be confusion over which animals it is OK to eat (Horse scare lifts sales for veggie firms, 6 March). Traditionally this has been down to 1) what puts up the least fight 2) what can you industrially farm and 3) what haven&apos;t you made friends with lately and/or consider stupid. I&apos;ve been given some guidance by a foundling sheep, Dylan. He is an intelligent, curious, affectionate animal, who operates much like the rest of us. He enjoys a good meal followed by a sleep, preferably on something soft. (My dog should take note: he doesn&apos;t bite, bark or shed; he trims the lawn and enjoys weeding.) His career goal is to go on enjoying the same, not hanging from a meat hook somewhere, having made a terrifying last journey to a slaughter house. It would be sad to see him stunned and beheaded as a cheap option for lunch and because I couldn&apos;t Google how to cook beans.Arlene NixonAlexandra, New Zealand",

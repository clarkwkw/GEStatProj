    "text": "Yesterday in the sunshine, the air was uncomfortably full of insects; evidently it was their opening-day. There were many gnats and other dipterous flies about, but most of the insects were beetles. They were rove or staphylinid beetles of various sizes, but as there are over 800 species in Britain, and many of them are very difficult to identify, I do not pretend that I could distinguish any of them. These small flying rove beetles have two most objectionable habits; they have a knack of aiming directly for the eyes of cyclists, and, having reached their goal, they treat their unwilling host to slight but painful dose of corrosive fluid. Like many other beetles, they possess longer wings than wing-cases, but they have also elongated hinder bodies or abdomens which they can turn up at will. The first thing they do when they alight upon our faces or clothing, provided they do not reach the desired eye or mouth, is to cock up the tail and deftly fold and tuck the wings beneath the short elytra or wing-coverings. The bird seen in the Prestwich Clough was probably a ring ousel. When on migration it is often met with in places where it does not nest. The blackbird&apos;s nest reported is not early.",

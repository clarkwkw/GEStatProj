    "text": "Tony Little argues (In defence of Eton, 6 October) that Etonians are &quot;of value to society&quot; and &quot;serve the public good&quot;. Possibly, but seldom as teachers, social workers or nurses. Instead, they are disproportionately represented in politics, and at top levels, where they have an influence over everybody else. The qualities he claims of Eton, such as &quot;lively, challenging, stimulating&quot;, are true of most schools, which could also add that they better foster the understanding of all kinds of people  women, disadvantaged, poor. The reasons he gives for the success of ex-students are insufficient, which is why concern about the unrepresentative nature of senior politicians and anxieties about cronyism will continue.Phil HindHuntingdon, Cambridgeshire  No one could argue with Little&apos;s article on the advantages of good education. But he ignores something he is surely aware of: the social capital gained by such privilege and the (almost inevitable) attendance at Oxbridge. This leads to the old-boy network and is possibly one of the reasons Cameron did not sack Jeremy Hunt. And no, it does not matter he went to Charterhouse  he will still be seen as (to use Margaret Thatcher&apos;s term) &quot;one of us&quot;.Frank WestLondon  Little says the boys are &quot;part of the world around them&quot;. Please could he tell us how many of them a) are on free school meals; b) come from families on benefits; c) have had a member of their family die of starvation (Mother and son deaths reveal benefit gap, p11, same day)?Jenny MaxwellCraven Arms, Shropshire",

    "text": "Don&apos;t underestimate the time required to review and revise your dissertation. In this third and final part of our series, we look at how to do a good job of editing. Review your work as a whole Keep your outline plan in front of you, and go through your work as a whole. Have you developed a clear argument in response to your central question or dissertation title? Make sure the content matches the title appropriately  don&apos;t be afraid to re-phrase your dissertation topic if you&apos;ve shifted focus while writing or you want to do so while reviewing. Have you defined key words and concepts early on? That way you remove the risk of confusing the reader. Try to imagine a friend or member of your family who has no knowledge of the subject reading your dissertation, and ask yourself whether you have done enough to explain each term and concept. Review each section Read over each section, and make up a title for it to help you check that all points and details are directly relevant.  Does the content all belong in this section? Highlight anything that might be better placed in another section or could be cut, such as parts that are peripheral to the discussion or have been repeated elsewhere. Is there too much description and not enough analysis? You may need to be more explicit about the implications of a point. In other words, make it clearer to the reader why the point is included, and how it helps to address the problems or questions within your inquiry. Review each paragraph Ensure that the first sentence of each paragraph introduces the idea you want to communicate and shows how this paragraph relates to the discussion so far.  Opening phrases such as: &quot;In addition to this problem,&quot; &quot;Furthermore,&quot; &quot;However,&quot; and &quot;In contrast to this view,&quot; can help to clarify this relationship. Bear in mind that each paragraph should have just one key idea. Subsequent sentences in the paragraph might include: An explanation or development of the point you&apos;re making A quote or indirect reference from your reading that supports it An example of your own  A hint at what still remains to be addressed Review each sentence When editing such a large document, it&apos;s easy to make simple mistakes. Make sure that you have no sentences longer than three lines and carefully review all punctuation. To help you with this, read each sentence aloud. Check all quotations are surrounded by quotation marks  double or single, as long as you are consistent throughout  check for common homophone errors (like their/there and advice/advise), and ensure your apostrophes are in the right place. Identify the main subject of each sentence and the main action. Are they buried among too many unnecessary words and phrases? Cut every unnecessary word and read again. Don&apos;t underestimate the importance of spellchecking and pay particular attention to the spellings of key names and theories. Make sure your use of capital letters is both correct and consistent.

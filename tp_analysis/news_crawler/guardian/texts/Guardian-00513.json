    "text": "The secretary of state for universities and science, David Willetts, has unveiled his ambition to make the UK the &quot;best place in the world to do science&quot;. It&apos;s the sort of &quot;white heat of technology&quot; statement with which it is difficult to disagree. This being the first week of January, Willetts even managed to get on the Today programme, where a bemused Evan Davies asked quite reasonably how this vision was to be realised. &quot;There is no extra public money here,&quot; admitted Willetts, explaining that he was calling on institutions and businesses to &quot;come up with ideas&quot; which BIS would &quot;look at sympathetically&quot;. It&apos;s as if Willetts thinks that if he shuts his eyes really tight and concentrates on what he wants really really hard, it will somehow happen. Later, when Willetts gave his speech on technology to the Policy Exchange thinktank in London, it emerged that much of the inspiration for this had come from New York. Mayor Bloomberg has announced the creation of a new graduate school focused on high-tech research, which is being made possible by a $350m gift from Charles Feeney, a billionaire who made his money from duty-free shops. Willetts hopes that &quot;a major city&quot; will find its own sugar daddy or mummy to sponsor a similar initiative in the UK. So if Boris Johnson is re-elected as London Mayor, the hope is that he will team up with a couple of his hedge-fund buddies and set up the LIT (London Institute of Technology  there are probably already at least three of these established over chippies in the East End). Perhaps it could be built out on that muddy island where he hopes to put London&apos;s third major airport, or it could be a virtual island hovering surreally over the Thames. The hope is that such an institution would combine the inspirational thinking and business acumen required to enable UK scientists to have the next big idea and turn it into GDP. I hate to burst this bubble, but a small private or public/private postgraduate school is not going to make the UK the &quot;best place in the world to study science&quot;. If we are to avoid a managed long-term decline in research then there are serious structural problems to be addressed. Investment in research from business is significantly lower in the UK than in many of our competitors and an alarmingly high proportion of that investment is from foreign-controlled companies (think Pfizer). The business community argues that liberalising tax, planning and regulation would encourage them to spend more. A recent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests that a reformed system of research and development tax relief could increase economic output by 3.1bn over three years and create 30,000 jobs. The Treasury recently announced that it would go part of the way towards doing this with changes to the R&amp;D Tax Credits system. One bright spot is the potential for small and medium enterprises to invest in research. But it&apos;s not always easy for hard-pressed growing businesses to find the time to engage with universities. All over the UK, universities are putting in the painstaking hard work needed to enable SMEs to engage with researchers. The changes needed are often practical, involving tax, planning and the nitty-gritty of regulation. The combination of big, systemic and dull detail is not the stuff that &quot;white heat&quot; visions are made of  and even worse, for Willetts, most of it is completely outside the control of BIS. In the face of this, I empathise with his desire to cut through it all with a small and easily defined project led by a successful and wealthy individual. But I am afraid that the only way to really make the UK the best place for scientists to make discoveries and to make them pay is to solve the problems in the system we already have. That means wrapping cold towels round collective heads and getting down to the mindache-inducing business of getting government departments to work together and unravel the multiple financial, legislative and cultural barriers to success.

    "text": "If Sunday&apos;s match between Manchester City and QPR had taken place within Fifa, it would have been dismissed by the participants as a fanciful and unrealistic flourish. &quot;Fifa always makes it easier to score in extra time,&quot; we would have claimed. But it is also a sign that, as the years pass, the real sport and its most successful virtual companion are moving ever closer together.  On Tuesday, EA Sports revealed the first few details of Fifa 13, arriving in the autumn for (I kid you not), the 3DS, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, PC, PS3, PSP, Xbox and Vita  as well as &quot;other smartphone platforms&quot;. The key addition is set to be the new &quot;attacking intelligence&quot; technoloigy, which apparently allows computer players to think two-steps ahead, planning forward moves and responding more sharply to emerging offensive runs. From the press release:  Players now possess the intelligence to create, curve, or alter runs to capitalise on openings as they occur, make runs that pull defenders out of position to open passing channels for teammates, and better position themselves for new attacking opportunities.  The dribbling system has also been worked over since Fifa 12  although, promises of &quot;precise dribble touches&quot; and &quot;true 360 mobility with the ball&quot; were made last time if we&apos;re fair. Here though, we&apos;re promised more variation in the ability of different players (ie, expect your hulking defensive midfeilder&apos;s close ball control to be more messy than Messi), and a new first touch system:  Factors such as defensive pressure, trajectory of the ball, and velocity of the pass now impact a player&apos;s first touch, creating more opportunities for defenders to win back possession.  Adding to the increased physicality of Fifa 12 is an off-the-ball tussling component, allowiing defenders to jostle opposing strikers, forcing them into poor first touches. This is all more realistic, of course, but EA Sports will need to strike a balance between authentic simulation and annoying participants by taking control and ability away from their squad members. On this subject, don&apos;t expect to see diving in the game any time soon. According to producer, Dave Rutter, it&apos;s an element of the real game that spoils rather than enhances the simulated experience. Elsewhere, we&apos;re promised new modes and options as well as improvements to favourites such as the Head-to-Head Seasons and Career modes. Free kicks are also to be spruced up, allowing the taker to line up three players around the ball for those tricksy fakes and sleights. Meanwhile, defenders can add or subtract players from the wall, while sneakily moving it forward. At the moment, this sounds much more like a continuation of the work started in Fifa 12 than a radical overhaul  but we&apos;ll know more at E3 in June. And if that showdown between Man City and QPR taught us anything, it&apos;s not to judge any game on the raw pre-match statistics.",

    "text": "This week Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample meets Prof Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist at Harvard University and author of Knocking on Heaven&apos;s Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate our Universe.  Lisa introduces her recent eBook Higgs Discovery, which outlines the very latest thinking on particle physics and why the existence of a Higgs-like particle hints at a deeper understanding of the fundamental laws of physics, including a clearer conception of dark matter and dark energy. To get the most out of this fairly technical discussion, you might consider first listening to two previous editions of Science Weekly: our Higgs special with Prof Jon Butterworth who is part of the Atlas team at Cern, and our interview with Prof Carlos Frenk on the topic of dark matter.

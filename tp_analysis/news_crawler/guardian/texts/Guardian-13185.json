    "text": "This week on Tech Weekly, Aleks Krotoski talks to the inventor of the software bot Random Amazon Shopper. The software spends $50 of Darius&apos;s hard-earned cash and spends it on completely random items. The result is a very interesting record collection. Darius discusses the benefits of randomness on the web. Jemima Kiss meets up with the founders of wireWAX, Steve Callanan and Dan Galloway, to discuss their interactive video software. We also have a tech news roundup with the latest on Google&apos;s hotly anticipated smart glasses and news that Hotmail will soon be no more. The music featured in this week&apos;s edition is by The Ghost of 3.13 from the album Inwards on the Mozyk.net label in Bulgaria.",

    "headline": "What is the lifespan of a laptop?", 
    "text": "Commiserations on your laptop, although I&apos;m afraid to say five years could be considered a good innings. It&apos;s at the outer edge of what is considered the lifespan of a desktop computer (three to five years). Meanwhile it&apos;s difficult to specify the lifespan of laptops, as they are so often junked before they are broken. This is in part due to planned obsolescence  a devious ploy by manufacturers bolstered by marketing strategies to make us fall out of love with a product hastily. In IT planned obsolescence has been turbocharged by must-have software which is only upwardly compatible. Want better software? You&apos;ll need abetter machine. Planned obsolescence&apos;s running mate is Moore&apos;s law, which decrees that every two years the computing world doubles the amount of transistors on a computer chip and therefore the power of the computer. So you might say the average lifespan of a laptop is two years. Gulp. I have previously described the resources needed to make a computer, but here&apos;s a recap: one metric tonne of electronic scrap from personal computers contains more gold than that recovered from 17 tonnes of gold ore. Where will it all end? Moore&apos;s law should see transistors miniaturising every two years until we reach technological singularity  the point at which computers gain human-level intelligence and can build better versions of themselves. Others think time will soon be up on Moore&apos;s law, as computers will run out of matter and energy  by 2007 computers were reckoned to be drawing 4-5% of the world&apos;s power. Heat is the enemy of Moore&apos;s law. Those transistors packed on chips must be kept cool, so must the vast data storage centres, whose energy consumption, in 2010, was growing by 12% a year. We need to keep our cool, too. There&apos;s a huge amount of skill and knowledge online about how to make old computers worth their weight in gold. People who have dealt with IT for not-for-profits where there has never been much money for shiny new IT are particularly expert. Try Itforcharities.co.uk for alist of organisations waiting to takeon your &quot;obsolete&quot; model and Jayne Cravens&apos; postings on &quot;old tech&quot; at coyotecommunications.com. An untold truth is that we use a tiny fraction of each computer&apos;s capacity: you could say we&apos;re already outwitted by them. Unless we wise up we&apos;ll soon be overtaken by the machines. Green crush It may seem strange to have developed a crush on a bin bag, but this was a special bin bag. It was, in fact, the only bag of rubbish destined for landfill that John Newson, aBirmingham householder, produced in the whole of 2012. Dubbed the &quot;extreme recycler&quot;, Newson developed a no-tolerance system of recycling, composting and avoiding in an effort to get as near as possible to zero waste. When he found Tetra Paks couldn&apos;t be recycled in Birmingham he took them with him to recycling centres in London when he visited friends. That&apos;s what we call dedication. Greenspeak: peak farmland A term to indicate that the amount of land used to grow crops is at an all-time high as farmers across the world become increasingly productive. From here-on in we&apos;ll use less and less land for cropping. If you have an ethical dilemma, send an email to Lucy at lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk",

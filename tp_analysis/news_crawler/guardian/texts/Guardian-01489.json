    "text": "The dramatic fall in the UK&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions caused by the recession has proved to be a blip, with national emissions rising 3.1% in 2010. The new energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, attributed the rise, the first in almost a decade, to increased home heating during a cold winter and shutdowns at nuclear power stations after technical problems. &quot;One year won&apos;t knock the UK off meeting its long-term emission reduction targets, but it serves to underline the importance of the coalition&apos;s policies for insulating homes to cut bills and emissions and moving to greener alternative forms of energy,&quot; said Davey, a Liberal Democrat who took over from Chris Huhne, who resigned on Friday after being charged over an alleged attempt to avoid prosecution for a speeding offence.",    "section": "environment",

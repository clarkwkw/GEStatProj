    "text": "    Eastern phoebe, Sayornis phoebe (protonym, Muscicapa [] Phoebe), Latham, 1790, also known as the phoebe, as the bridge pewee or as the water pewee, photographed at White Hall, Virginia (USA).  Image: Pete Myers, 2 March 2009 (with permission) [velociraptorize].Nikon D300 80-400mm f/4.5-5.6 Nikkor ISO 320 Focal length 400mm 1/500 at f / 6.3    Question: This seemingly unremarkable mystery bird is a remarkable &quot;first&quot; in North America. Can you tell me about that &quot;first&quot;? This mystery bird will be challenging for you to identify from this image, but I think most of you can identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family at least. Can you identify this bird and tell me how to distinguish it from its family members? Response: This is an eastern phoebe, Sayornis phoebe, the most common tyrant flycatcher (family; Tyrannidae) species that you&apos;ll see in the eastern United States. This migratory bird, which winters in Central America, also pops up in western Europe from time to time, giving the local birders a thrill.  Eastern phoebes are consistently amongst the first migratory birds to arrive in the northeastern USA -- I&apos;ve seen them in Central Park in New York City in late March, which is at least three weeks before the first wave of neotropical migrants begins to arrive. They also are amongst the last migrants to leave in autumn.  Another &quot;first&quot;; the eastern phoebe was the first North American bird to be banded for study. John James Audubon banded an individual with a silvered thread in 1804, so he could document this bird&apos;s return the following spring.  Eastern phoebes are fairly tolerant of humans and their structures, hence their alternative common names. This trait has probably contributed to the increase in this species&apos; population and range since historic times. However, these birds are not very tolerant of each other, and tend to spend most of their time alone, even when breeding.  To give you an idea of their foraging behaviour, here&apos;s a brief video of an eastern phoebe hawking insects (filmed at North Carolina Museum of Life and Science, Durham, NC. Uploaded 9 May 2008):            Visit grcapro&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  This video gives you a good idea of the eastern phoebe&apos;s song, although the singer in this video is a mere speck on a bridge railing (filmed at Ocmulgee National Monument, Macon, Georgia on 2 April 2010):            Visit Lillybeth58&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].

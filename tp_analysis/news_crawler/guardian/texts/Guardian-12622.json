    "text": "Possibly the last thing you want as a console manufacturer, at the very dawn of a new hardware generation, is to have an ex-staff member criticising your whole approach in a vitriolic blog post. But that&apos;s exactly what&apos;s happened to Microsoft. Nat Brown was on the original Microsoft team that proposed and developed the Xbox concept  he even came up with the name (although he originally wrote it &apos;xBox&apos;...). But he&apos;s not happy with his previous employer.  In a post entitled &apos;Stupid, stupid xBox&apos;, he berates the company for failing to innovate, coasting on early successes and getting the modern games market completely wrong:  My gripe, my head-smack, is not that the broader content/entertainment business isn&apos;t where you want to go with a living-room-connected device. It absolutely is. Indeed, this was the point of xBox, that was why it was the Trojan horse for the living room, where we could land and be welcomed by millions of console customers with more hardware and better software and network connectivity than the non-console devices (webtv, cable set-top-boxes) we had been pursuing. No, more and better content was always the point and the plan.    My gripe is that, as usual, Microsoft has jumped its own shark and is out stomping through the weeds planning and talking about far-flung future strategies in interactive television and original programming partnerships with big dying media companies when their core product, their home town is on fire, their soldiers, their developers, are tired and deserting, and their supply-lines are broken.  His frustration is that, unlike Apple, Google or Valve, Microsoft has failed to build a development environment that allows smaller studios to quickly and cheaply produce and distribute their games. While iPhone developers have a comparatively swift route to market via the App Store, studios hoping to get their wares on Xbox Live or the well hidden Xbox Indie Games service have to wade through paperwork and approval processes. &quot;Microsoft,&quot; he writes, &quot;You are idiotic to have ceded not just indie game developers but also a generation of loyal kids and teens to making games for other people&apos;s mobile devices.&quot; He also takes issue with the Xbox 360 user interface, which beyond the main dashboard, he refers to as &quot;creaky, slow, and full-of-shit&quot;. The process of saving games and updating with new content is dismissed as unnecessarily cumbersome and complicated:   &quot;So, because these two critical issues  user experience and indie content  are not nearly in order and I see big investments in future interactive content happening, as well as idiotic moves to limit used games or put harder content protection into place than exists in mobile or tablets  i predict massive failure and losses here.&quot;   He has a point  but elements of his rant are as relevant to PlayStation as they are to Xbox. Both Sony and Microsoft have shown a determination to chase media partnerships with the likes of Netflix and Hulu at the expense of creating really welcoming developer environments. While VOD services may broaden the range of entertainment offerings, it is usually content that&apos;s available on every other computing device, not to mention on your TV. And when I switch on my Xbox or PS3, I&apos;d much rather see an advert for a new interesting indie game than the latest subscription offer from LoveFilm.  Although Xbox and PlayStation aren&apos;t directly competing directly against iPhone and Android at a consumer level, they are fighting for developers; I&apos;ve spoken to several studios that have given up producing (or trying to produce) content for digital platforms like PSN and XBLA because they were losing money, or simply failing to get through the approvals process. They&apos;re now making PC or smartphone games.  It&apos;s clear that console manufacturers have to discover a means of ensuring quality control and security for customers, while providing an ecosystem that welcomes developers. This is a major challenge for the next generation of consoles. It&apos;s a challenge that the man who helped invent Xbox thinks may already have been lost.",

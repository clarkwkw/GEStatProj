    "text": "Earth Day is 43 years&apos; old today and designed to &quot;[activate] individuals and organizations to strengthen the collective fight against man&apos;s exploitive relationship with the planet.&quot; Denis Hayes, the national coordinator of its first day, said a few years back that he thought the day had achieved many of its aims. With a recent global poll showing that public concern over environmental problems such as climate change and biodiversity loss is its lowest in 20 years, it&apos;s clear that there&apos;s still a need for the event.

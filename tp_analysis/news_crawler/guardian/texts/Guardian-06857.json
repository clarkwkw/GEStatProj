    "text": "Alok Jha meets neuroscientist Sebastian Seung who is professor of computational neuroscience at MIT and the author of Connectome: How the Brain&apos;s Wiring Makes Us Who We Are. Sebastian discusses our growing understanding of the brain&apos;s connections  the connectome  and how they correlate with the human genome. He also shows us how we can all get involved as citizen scientists in the mapping of the connectome.  Plus, we delve into our archive for another great interview on the subject of the brain. Professor Barry Smith, director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of London, discusses what happens when neural connections in the brain malfunction and how this causes disorders such as an inability to recognise faces and phantom-limb syndrome.

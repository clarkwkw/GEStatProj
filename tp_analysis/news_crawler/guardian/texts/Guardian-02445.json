    "text": "   Personal tax statements will be introduced in 2014.     Like many people, my first reaction to the introduction of personal tax statements was horror at the prospect of pub boors becoming even greater wankers from 2014. You will not be able to ride a taxi, prop up a bar or visit the family at Christmas without a red-faced little Englander waving their bit of paper and shrieking about his compulsory donations to the communists. It&apos;s hard to think of a way to inject more bile into public debate. Superficially they seem like a decent idea. The trouble begins when you try to figure out what the list of statistics should contain. There&apos;s no such thing as a document without biases - even if you could construct a series of unbiased factual statements about the world, you would still have to decide which to include, and in what order - and these statements are likely be riddled with them.  Take the welfare budget. According to the example statement, someone earning 25,000 would pay around 5,700 in income tax, of which a third - 1,900 - would go into welfare. At this level of detail the conclusions should be obvious - clearly those scrounging layabout chavs we keep hearing about are sucking our country dry!      HM Treasury's statement, showing where tax goes for a person earning 25,000 per year, paying 5,702.12 in tax. You can browse the full document here.    Or are they? Let&apos;s look a little deeper. Of those nineteen hundred pounds, eight hundred go to &apos;old age&apos;, three hundred and fifty to the sick and disabled, two hundred and forty are set aside for &apos;family and children&apos; and two hundred for &apos;housing&apos;. Unemployment benefits account for just 56.74 of the 1,900 total. Curiously, three hundred pounds remain unaccounted for in the example statement. In contrast, the elderly consume a large proportion of both the 1,900 welfare bill and the 1,000 health bill. They consume more than their fair share of a third resource as well - copies of the Daily Mail. Cormac Hollingsworth cheekily suggests that the figures could be used to argue that actually young workers are forking out money for scrounging layabout Daily Mail readers.  Whether or not that&apos;s true, the bigger point is that, through editorial decisions about which details to include (or exclude), the Treasury can effectively &apos;spin&apos; our taxes.  Sure enough, the example statement gives different levels of detail for different budgets. Of the hypothetical tax-payer&apos;s bill, 329 pays for &apos;Defence&apos; and 283.69 for &apos;Public order and safety&apos;. The latter is expanded over several rows to detail the amounts going to the police, courts, prisons and fire services; but the larger defence budget is presented as a single, inscrutable figure.  That&apos;s an interesting choice when you look at the document the figures are drawn from -  The Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis, 2011. There you can find all sorts of hidden detail, such as the fact that the defence budget included foreign military aid, and that more money was spent on this than on fire-protection services. Only one of these figures was deemed important enough to mention to tax-payers. On the subject of interesting choices; the figures in the example statement are broken down in order of cost - all except one. &apos;National debt interest&apos; is placed first. An editorial expression of importance. An emphasis in a document that will be mailed to twenty million people ahead of an election in which national debt is likely to play a key political role.  Why choose to tell tax-payers about the 28 they spent on the fire service, but not the 32 that went to fund military aid? Why place debt interest first? These decisions were probably completely innocent, but even unintentional biases build with each brick of data added or subtracted.  The biggest bias of all isn&apos;t in the statement itself though, but hidden in the choice of who to send it to - income tax payers. By making this choice the government neatly divides the country into givers and takers, contributors and scroungers. Students, pensioners, people out of work, people with disabilities, the poor; none of these groups will receive evidence of their contributions through VAT or fuel duty or other taxes. Nor will income tax payers see any figures setting out the extent to which they benefit economically from investment in public spending. Nor will we be able to inspect similar breakdowns for corporations like Vodafone or Tesco&apos;s, or see how much we lost to tax evasion or allocated to bailouts. Instead, the focus is firmly on ordinary people - who gives, and who takes. It tells people earning 25,000 per year that they &apos;lost&apos; 346 to the sick and disabled, but neglects to mention the impact of widening pay inequality on their salaries. It encourages the belief that the poor are poor because of other poor people, while the rich remain safely above the fray.  This may all sound like I&apos;m against the idea, but actually I&apos;m not. Anything that increases the flow of information from government to the public is usually a good idea in my book. If nothing else, it will bust some of the more tedious myths about where our money goes - the 28 a year contribution to the EU is clearly not bankrupting the country, for example. I just hope that people remember the old aphorism, &quot;beware of government officials bearing statistics.&quot; @mjrobbins",

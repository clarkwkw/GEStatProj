    "text": "Standing in the depths of one of the surviving remnants of the ancient pinewoods, I waited for the sound I hadcome to hear. The silence of the Highlands has to be consciously listenedfor and here it was indeed  complete silence. Visually it was difficult to know what to look at first. The trees were a mixture of birch and rowans plus the scots pine which, as usual, surpassed all the others. Along the river Farrar were the scattered juniper bushes, though perhaps trees would have been a betterword. They were columnar ratherthan prostrate and were that dark green that looks almost forbidding as only these very old trees can. Other impressive trees were nearby, thesmall stand of aspen whose leaves were changing from their pale summer greento the yellows of autumn. In contrast, their silver bark was wellmarked with black diamond shapesthat looked almost unreal. But there was something missing and it suddenly dawned on me  the aspen leaves were not trembling. The extremely flattened leaf stalks means that even in the slightest of breezes the leaves will shake. Well might the Latin name be Populus tremula. So there was no sound, and no breeze, but another of my senses was alerted as the fragrance of the pinewoodcame over me. It seemed like theresin from the pines but I could notbe sure. Then the silence was brokenby the guttural roaring of a red deer stag that sounded very close, but insuch woodland I stood no chance ofseeing it. It was answered by another stag and then another and within a few minutes there were at least five stags joining in from various parts of the wooded glen. It was one of those rare, magic moments that will long live in my mind.",

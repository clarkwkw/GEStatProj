    "text": "Research supports Michael Rosen and 90 other writers and artists who urged a reduction in spelling, grammar and phonics teaching and an increased emphasis on reading for enjoyment (Children must be free to read for fun, Letters, 24 July). Studies done over the past 100 years show spelling instruction has little effect on spelling accuracy and that formal study of grammar does not improve reading and writing. Studies over the past 25 years show heavy phonics study (termed systematic intensive phonics) only helps children do better in tests where they pronounce lists of words out loud; it has no significant effect on tests where children have to understand what they read. Research also confirms that those who read more do read, write and spell better, have larger vocabularies and better control of complex grammar rules. The best way to ensure pupils develop a strong command of written and spoken English is to encourage wide, self-selected reading.Professor emeritus Stephen KrashenUniversity of Southern California, USA",

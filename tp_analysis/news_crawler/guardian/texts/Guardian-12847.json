    "text": "Confident that no one would notice what he was doing, Michael Nicod spent months in the homes of families he did not know, making detailed notes about everything they ate. Nicod was performing research for Britain&apos;s Department of Health and Social Security in 1974. He and his colleague, University College London professor Mary Douglas, wrote a report called Taking the Biscuit: The Structure of British Meals. Nicod and Douglas wanted to identify what typical British persons see as the essential parts of their typical meals. The pair drew on their training as anthropologists: &quot;We imagined a dietician in an unknown Papuan or African tribe wondering how to introduce a new, reinforcing element into tribal diet. We assumed that the dietician&apos;s first task would be to discover how the tribe &apos;structured&apos; their food.&quot; Nicod lived as a lodger with &quot;four working-class families where the head was engaged in unskilled manual labour&quot;, in East Finchley, Durham, Birmingham and Coventry. He stayed in each place at least a month, &quot;watching every mouthful and sharing whenever possible&quot;. Nicod and Douglas express confidence in the obliviousness of the natives. &quot;We reckon&quot;, they write, &quot;that after 10 days of such a discreet and incurious presence, the most sensitive housewife, busy with her children, settles down to her routine menus.&quot; Many others have imagined new ways to examine and change the eating habits of persons other than themselves. In 2006, Mariana Simons-Nikolova and Maarten Bodlaender of the Netherlands applied for a patent for an electro-mechanical process they call Modifying a person&apos;s eating and activity habits. Their video/computer system would monitor an individual&apos;s head and hands to detect when they were eating. It would then announce to them via the TV or computer, &quot;You Are Now Eating&quot;. Simons-Nikolova and Bodlaender explain: &quot;By providing the feedback when the subject is still eating or drinking, the subject is helped to stop the eating or drinking sooner than if no feedback had been given.&quot; A 2008 patent by three Israeli inventors describes &quot;a sensor which detects: (a) the patient swallowing, (b) the filling of the patient&apos;s stomach, and/or (c) the onset of contractions in the stomach as a result of eating&quot;. Electric current can then, for dietary reasons, be &quot;driven into muscle tissue of the subject&apos;s stomach&quot;. This &quot;induces in the subject a sensation of satiation, discomfort, nausea, or vertigo&quot;. Three Indian inventors filed a patent application in 2010 for a &quot;refrigerator for obese persons&quot;. The fridge monitors &quot;all eating and drinking&quot;, and dispenses diet advice. Also, &quot;a reflecting mirror film on the door makes the person to control overeating as soon as he stands before the fridge&quot;. With these and related plans does society become more equipped for &quot;watching every mouthful&quot; of some of its members.

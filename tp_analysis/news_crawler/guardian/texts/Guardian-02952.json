The first is to make a perfect copy using a lossless system such as FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec). The second is to make a copy that is so good that you will never be able to hear the difference. I chose the second option, and encoded tracks in 320kbps MP3. FLAC captures all the information in the recording, but it has two significant disadvantages: it produces large files, and not all portable music players can handle it. (Unfortunately, both Apple and Microsoft have their own lossless formats.) The MP3 codec, by contrast, delivers smaller files that almost every device  PC, phone, MP3 player, CD player etc  can play. It&apos;s the closest thing we have to a universal music format. I could have used a lower bit rate than 320kbps (actually VBR: variable bit rate), and I can&apos;t reliably hear the difference between lossless and 196kbps MP3 files. However, using a higher bit rate should mean that when I buy better equipment - such as a high-end MP3 player  it won&apos;t expose problems that were masked before. As you may have found, a good quality hi-fi stack and studio monitors can reveal flaws in music files that are inaudible when using a mainstream MP3 player with headphones or earbuds. This applies to CDs as well. I could also have used a lower bit rate with the AAC file format, because it is more efficient than MP3. AAC makes a real difference at low bit rates, especially below 128kbps, but it doesn&apos;t make any practical difference at 256kbps and higher bit rates. I decided against AAC because it was far less widely supported than MP3, because there are several versions of AAC, and because I noticed most people like me were using MP3. (If a lot of people have the same problem, someone will produce a fix.) When I wrote a feature about this, Finding the music format of the future, way back in 2007, I was bullish about AAC. Apple had just decided to offer unprotected 256kbps AAC files alongside its DRM-protected 128kbps AAC files, which I wouldn&apos;t use even if they were free. However, AAC has not made the sort of progress I expected, and I haven&apos;t regretted choosing MP3. So, what&apos;s the best way to rip your files? This topic has been debated in considerable depth for at least two decades by people who are much more qualified than I am, so I decided to adopt what many experts considered the best approach. That was to rip CDs using Exact Audio Copy (EAC) software and the open source LAME, following one of the guides at the Hydrogen Audio website: EAC and LAME. (The name stands recursively for Lame Aint an MP3 Encoder.) I was interested to find that the results sounded better to someone who doesn&apos;t have a clue what a file format is, and has zero interest in the topic. I had shown my wife how to rip her own (classical) CDs on a Mac laptop using the iTunes defaults and left her to it: job done. A few days later, she got me to rerip them using my system because she wasn&apos;t happy with the sound quality. Hydrogen Audio has quite a few Guides, including nine that use EAC. But if you decide to use CDex and FLAC, for example, there&apos;s a guide for that. Hard drive sizes have grown over the past half dozen years, so we now have 750GB and 1TB drives where we used to have 120GB or 150GB drives. This means the extra size of FLAC files  which can be roughly half the size of the original WAV files  is less of an issue. For comparison, a 24-bit FLAC version of Pink Floyd&apos;s Dark Side of the Moon (1973) takes up 239MB whereas my 320kbps MP3 version takes up 71MB.  You may find lossless files take up too much space, but it depends how many CDs you want to rip. Although not every device will play FLAC, you can use these files to produce MP3, AAC, WMA or other lossy formats for mobile devices. The lossless rip becomes the master copy of the CD, so you never have to rip it again. If you need 320kbps MP3 files for a good quality MP3 player and/or 128kbps versions for a mobile phone, you can make them whenever you like. This is not the same as &quot;transcoding&quot; between different lossy formats, such as MP3 or WMA and AAC. That leads to a loss in quality, and is always a bad idea. I didn&apos;t rip things to FLAC, back in the day, and I&apos;m not entirely sure I&apos;d do it now. But if you don&apos;t have one or two decades of music files or want to make a fresh start, it&apos;s certainly worth considering. Also, if we are ever going to move to a system that provides better-than-CD quality, FLAC is by far the most popular format. Linn Records sells 24-bit studio master recordings in FLAC format, and Apple Corps and EMI released a limited edition of The Beatles back catalogue in 24-bit FLAC and 320kbps MP3 on an Apple-shaped USB stick. The problem with FLAC files is that Apple iPods won&apos;t play them.  This isn&apos;t a practical problem at the moment: they consume so much space, you probably wouldn&apos;t want to play FLAC files on a mobile device. However, people who are solidly in the iPod/iPhone/iTunes camp should consider using ALAC, Apple&apos;s Lossless Audio Codec, instead. Most iPods with recent firmware can play ALAC files, it&apos;s used in Airtunes, and Apple has now made the format open source. Lossless is lossless so ALAC files should sound identical to FLAC files (as long as you have iTunes&apos; Soundcheck switched off during playback). It&apos;s really a matter of convenience. Of course, Macs can play FLAC files, and Mac users can convert FLAC (and other) files into other formats using, for example, the open source Max. If you are going to transcode audio files for mobile use, it doesn&apos;t matter whether you convert them from ALAC or FLAC.",

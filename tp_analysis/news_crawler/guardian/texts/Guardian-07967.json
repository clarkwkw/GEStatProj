    "text": "The haar, a type of sea mist, took a long time to clear from the hills and even then it hung on in the straths and glens. At those lower levels it was like a light grey, dense shroud, defying the morning sun to burn it away. With the haar came the promise of a warm sunny day, and that had come to pass by the time I was on the side of the loch, which lies to the east of Loch Ness. The stillness and silence of the loch was, even for the Highlands, almost uncanny, with not even the sound of a bird. With the rowan trees beginning to colour and heavy with half-formed berries, it was as if everything was waiting with bated breath for the late summer to turn to autumn. Just occasionally there was a distinct plop from the water as a brown trout rose to take a fly. One small fish actually jumped, with a distinct splash, more than a foot out of the water and, as usual, I wondered why some fish do this. Two of last year&apos;s frogs, froglets I call them, were near the water and they reminded me that this is one of the few sites in the north where you can find frogs and toads both breeding in the same place. Despite the aquatic attractions, which included large beds of late, shimmering white flowers of water lilies, damselflies and dragonflies, what stole the show were the butterflies. Some of the many Scotch argus were pristine, newly emerged as adults. The wings looked almost black contrasting with the rich brown &quot;eye&quot; markings, each with their tiny intense white centres. The several speckled woods were different; most of them were tattered with some having large gaps in their wings. These are from the second generation of the year and are fascinating in that they have the unique ability among British butterflies of overwintering as either a caterpillar or a chrysalis.",

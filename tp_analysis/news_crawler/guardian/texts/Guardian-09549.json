    "text": "If the Shifting World title sounds familiar, it is because the 2D platforming game started life as a range of cult browser titles, playable on the internet. Back in 2008 that series was named Shift, and charmed many who stumbled upon its stark monochrome visuals and brilliantly simple core gameplay mechanic. And as it was with Shift, so it is with Shifting World. For this 3DS version, there is only black-and-white. Black platforms are solid, and white serves as a backdrop. So far, so ordinary. But, with a jab of the console&apos;s buttons, Shifting World&apos;s environments flip upside down, while black and white switch properties. To progress through the game, you hop between the dimensions of shade and negotiate increasingly elaborate and convoluted puzzles. Unlike the original games, Shifting World also introduces the ability to manipulate the relationship between the second and third dimensions, which creates an even more well-crafted game that is full of challenges. However, it is more suited to the short play sessions that underpinned the design of the browser version. Played in lengthy chunks, it can feel somewhat repetitive. But if you&apos;re looking for a perfect distraction to fill all those little two-minute gaps, Shifting World does the job admirably.",

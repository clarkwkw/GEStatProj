    "text": "The furore around the topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge has died down, but is still ongoing, and no doubt will continue to while ever-invasive paparazzi ply their trade. I did spot one quote from a paparazzo defending the photos, and other candid photos of topless celebrities, with the (paraphrased) argument &quot;people will pay a lot of money for them, and I need to earn a living&quot;. An identical argument could be applied to drug or arms dealers; even if it&apos;s true, you&apos;re still a bastard. But amid the scandal, I was genuinely surprised that Kate Middleton chose to sunbathe topless. The Duchess of Cambridge is, as the title suggests, a member of the Royal Family now, as that minor event last year pointed out. I genuinely have trouble processing the idea of a royal doing something so &apos;biological&apos;, especially in public. I perceive them not so much as humans as characters created to represent Britain. Being told that a royal had been seen sunbathing topless was like being told Wenlock and Mandeville had been caught urinating in public; I didn&apos;t think such a thing was possible (well, maybe if it was Prince Harry). I recently signed the petition to end Page 3 in the Sun. But I did this while on holiday in Magaluf, where women sunbathing topless is relatively common. It&apos;s actually quite unnerving to someone like me, a pasty Celt who has limited experience with overt displays of female sexuality (and direct sunlight) who is holidaying with his wife, child and in-laws.  As a heterosexual male, I do find bare female breasts &quot;stimulating&quot;, but I don&apos;t feel comfortable ogling and discussing them at length like some. I find that crass. But from a purely intellectual viewpoint, breasts themselves are of scientific interest, seeing as permanent enlarged breasts in females are a uniquely human property. Exactly why this would occur in an evolutionary sense remains to be determined, despite a frankly worrying (but perhaps unsurprising) amount of study, but theories abound, usually from evolutionary psychology, which is always good for a laugh. It&apos;s argued that, as child rearing only takes up a fraction of a woman&apos;s life, breasts must be some function other than milk supply. A typical argument is they developed as a secondary sex characteristic. It&apos;s often suggested that they developed to resemble buttocks, which can signal sexual readiness in primates, but breasts encourage face-to-face copulation, which is apparently easier/better for us upright hominids. I&apos;ve even seen a theory which states that breasts evolved to remind men of their mother&apos;s buttocks, a familiar and reassuring site for tree-climbing primates, and a notion to make every male reading this recoil in oedipal disgust. But the general consensus among those interested is that permanent breasts evolved for the purpose of sexual attraction. Ergo, you could argue that a woman saying to a man &quot;stop staring at my breasts&quot; is the equivalent of saying &quot;stop walking with your legs&quot;; but that&apos;s what they&apos;re for!  (Men: please don&apos;t try this argument on any actual women who catch you leering, lest you end up with 2 swollen appendages of your own. And deservedly so; if you adhere to the &quot;that&apos;s what it&apos;s evolved for&quot; argument, then the penis is technically the shape it is in order to displace other men&apos;s semen from a vagina. So you should only sleep with women who have recently had sex with another man, otherwise you&apos;re a hypocrite). Regardless of why, permanently enlarged breasts are universal in human women. This isn&apos;t the case for how breasts are perceived culturally. In many indigenous tribes, women don&apos;t cover their breasts as there is no perceived need to do so, whereas in western society, the briefest glimpse of the female nipple in a public context can cause outrage. Unless, like I said, it&apos;s daily in Britain&apos;s Number 1 newspaper. I&apos;m in no position to debate the reasons and logic (or lack thereof) about why this is, but it does make the topless sunbathing thing a bit more complex. The rules and conventions about it are seemingly widely known but never explicitly stated. Based on my limited holiday observations, it seems to me that topless sunbathing by the pool/beach = acceptable, topless buying a drink from the nearby bar = not acceptable, topless using a mobile phone to discuss how many duty free cigarettes someone wants = weird. Unless women receive a manual on sunbathing etiquette upon reaching puberty, I don&apos;t know how these conventions arose.  But then, the logic behind sunbathing (topless or otherwise) has always escaped me somewhat. It is pleasant to relax in the hot sun, maybe it triggers some basking response in our &apos;reptile&apos; brain? Presumably, women who sunbathe topless are hoping for an even, all-over tan. I assume this is for purely aesthetic reasons, rather than for the aforementioned &quot;attracting a mate&quot; theory. I can&apos;t envisage a man getting to the &quot;tops off&quot; phase of a sexual encounter with a woman and calling things to a halt because of mismatched skin-tone. But maybe that&apos;s just me. But the obsession with tanning became excessive long ago. Odds are it made sense once, when being tanned was a sign of good health and prosperity, when being able to travel overseas was relatively uncommon, but we&apos;re long past that. I blame our old friend the beauty industry, who make a fortune convincing people that the right skin tone is a different one, wherever you&apos;re from.  False tan has become a bit of a joke at this point, with so many references to enthusiastic users being &apos;orange&apos;. It does annoy me, the orange tan thing, but not for any sneering or judgemental reasons. My argument is this; if we&apos;re well past the point where it&apos;s acceptable to wander around in public sprayed a clearly synthetic colour, why does it always have to be orange? There&apos;s surely not that limited a range of safe pigments available? It&apos;s only a matter of time before someone realises that out, surely. I bet soon it&apos;ll be fairly common to see groups of scantily-clad women in town on Friday night, all sprayed a different colour of the rainbow, like something out of one of Captain Kirk&apos;s wet dreams. If this proves successful, maybe in a few hundred millennia people will evolve a whole new range of colourful skin tones in order to attract a mate. Or maybe men will just carry on staring at breasts, so the whole thing will be irrelevant. You may take issue or disagree with any or all parts of this piece, but at least I got it published somewhere, so I&apos;ve proved the editors of Nuts magazine wrong. Plus, there is some amusement to be had from knowing that at least some searches for topless celebrities will now end up in the Guardian science section. Avoid the leering, probing gaze of Dean Burnett by interacting with him in a text-only format on twitter. @garwboy  This article was amended on 2 October 2012. The original referred to Kate Middleton, who is now more correctly called the Duchess of Cambridge. This has been corrected.",

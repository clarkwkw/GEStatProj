    "text": "My earliest remembered encounter with trees was unhappy. I had drawn a picture of some with green blob tops. The local artist enlisted to assist the school that I attended during the second world war was unimpressed and chastised me severely: &quot;Trees,&quot; he insisted, &quot;do not look like that. They have branches. Don&apos;t ever draw them like that again.&quot; At the time this went over my seven-year-old head. There&apos;s no better time than winter to see just what he was talking about. So I stand with pleasure, on the one sunny day this season of downpours and dreariness has offered, at the foot of the sand-hill on Rockford Common, looking up at the silver birch at the top of the slope beautifully set off against the clear blue sky. With the sun reflecting from its bark, my eye is drawn ever upwards following the silver threads as they divide and narrow until they disappear into bark not yet mature enough to be this tree&apos;s hallmark coating. Birches are the most prolific of the trees around the common. They are among the earliest of colonisers and will rapidly turn open ground into woodland. There are signs of this expansionist tendency all through the areas of heathland. Not all the full-grown trees have had an easy infancy. Some have a split stem that divides at ground level, a sign perhaps that their early growth was nibbled back. One leans acutely, suggesting that it has been constantly windswept, except that its foliage is perfectly balanced. On the old gravel workings where gorse dominates, ponies have congregated among the brakes. Most are grazing but one mare is foraging along a line of bushes, carefully selecting the tenderest tips. Gorse is highly nutritious and the animals learn early on how to cope with its prickles. After she&apos;s joined the others I retrace her path, which is marked by a trail of sprigs that she&apos;s pulled and rejected. On the way back I pause to examine the sand-hill. Once home to a colony of sand martins, now it&apos;s a playground and is being deeply cut when heavy rain runs down from above. A closer look shows that helping hands are deepening the channel. The geology beneath is beginning to be seen.",

    "text": "Marek Kukula (Guardian username @MarekKukula) is public astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. He studied radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank Observatory before researching black holes and distant galaxies at various astronomy centres including the Space Telescope Science Institute, home of the Hubble Space Telescope.  He can answer questions about how the transit of Venus was used to measure the scale of the solar system and why this year&apos;s transit could help astronomers understand newly discovered planets orbiting other stars. Rebekah Higgitt (@beckyfh) is a curator and historian of science at the Royal Observatory Greenwich and National Maritime Museum. She is an expert on the work of the observatory in the 18th century, when the first global scientific collaboration centered on the transits of 1761 and 1769 and is happy to answer questions about all historical transits of Venus from the 17th century onwards. Helen Czerski (@HelenCz) is a physicist and oceanographer at Southampton University. She will co-present a Horizon documentary, The Transit of Venus, on BBC Two at 9pm on Tuesday. Stuart Clark (@DrStuClark) is an astronomy journalist, author and novelist. He is happy to answer questions about conditions on Venus, the historical importance of transits and what new science may emerge from studying them. Our experts will be here to answer your questions between 1pm and 2pm BST on Thursday. Please leave your questions in the comments.",

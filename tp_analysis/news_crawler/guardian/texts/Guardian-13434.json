    "text": "When I say that the ageing market holds 80% of the wealth of the UK, audiences  whether research or business based  start to listen. Businesses have become more interested in the ageing market not because it is growing (it has been doing so since the postwar period), but because it has an extraordinary buying power. Ageing consumers, with their mortgages paid off on their empty nests, are often in possession of considerable disposable income. Social discourse around older people tends to refer either to the array of social services and gains that younger generations cannot benefit from, or, at the other end of the spectrum, they are associated with poor, needy and vulnerable stereotypes  generalisations that do more harm than good. Researchers from a range of different disciplines are now seeking to better understand the implications of our ageing society in order to develop policy, services and products that meet the needs of older people in a positive and empowering way. But as this research area grows, it is important that we move away from stereotypes and start viewing ageing as a natural evolution of life. Who is old? What do we know about ageing? How do we study the impact of the ageing process on the adoption of everyday products and services? There is extensive literature on the effects of cognitive and sensory decline and their impact on decision-making, dexterity, and visual clarity. Ageing is associated with the decline of these abilities, but little is said about our innate compensation mechanisms, those astute and precise strategies that each of us put in place when growing older. Our cumulative life experience and social networks both play a big role in how we deal with everyday and exceptional life circumstances, and leading to much more than &apos;coping&apos; strategies. I would argue that we  both researchers and practitioners  cannot discount these strategies when researching ageing and the ageing consumer. Through life experience we develop a more confident taste for what we like and dislike, reducing the time it takes us to make a decision  often because we have matured a sense of trust towards certain brands and products. As we grow older we do not need to review every single alternative available in a systematic way. We reduce our selection set, and in so doing so we become more effective. This quicker age-induced emotional decision-making does vary depending on the product or type of service at hand. When looking at technology for example, decision-making criteria change considerably. Generally, older consumers are less familiar with technology due to reduced exposure and may revert to a more rational investigation of alternatives when purchasing technologies for themselves. Alongside the emotional decision-making involved in many but not all choices and purchases, we also rely heavily on the social networks we choose or find ourselves a part of. Tight social networks (our spouse, siblings or good neighbours for example), or extended networks (the grocery delivery driver or the geeky nephew who knows it all about mobile phones) play an important role in our adoption of less familiar products, mitigating the critical problems that arise from this lack of familiarity. In my own research on technology adoption by older people, it has been important to focus on a larger unit of analysis other than the individual ageing consumer along. A wider focus on the social resources available to the studied consumer allowed us to understand why and when the person was enabled, or indeed hindered, in making a choice. For example, in some observed cases, an older person&apos;s adoption of a smart phone would have not taken place if a complex task, such as setting up its software, had not been delegated to a member of that person&apos;s wider social network. Social resources and emotions scaffold our decision-making as we age. Researchers and organisations interested in fully understanding how we change as people and consumers at every stage of life, ought to pay attention to a broader unit of analysis, a wider context of social resources and relationships, that, enable us to live late life to the full. The implications for products and service design are considerable: as we age we may be users but not shoppers of the products we adopt, or we may be shoppers but not independent users for quite some time after purchase. This is the new wonderland for service innovation that can modify the perception of products and services and extend their value.

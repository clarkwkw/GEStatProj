    "text": "Age: 28. Appearance: Likely programmer. Unlikely billionaire. This is the Facebook guy, right? That&apos;s him. Mark &quot;Zuck&quot; Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO of Facebook, Inc, and the first person to make several billion dollars from a website with a &quot;poke&quot; function. What&apos;s he doing now? Poking his way into politics. Zuck has got together with a group of other top Silicon Valley executives to create an issues-based political action committee focusing  for the moment, at least  on liberalising the US visa andimmigration systems. And why do they want to reform immigration? They&apos;re a group of top executives. Ah. Because it&apos;s costing them money? Pretty much. Earlier this month, Zuck and a gang of 99 other chief execs, including Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, co-wrote a letter to President Obama calling the current immigration system &quot;outdated and inefficient&quot;. They said highly skilled immigrant workers were often unable to obtain permanent visas and forced to leave the country  and others were so put off by the system they wouldn&apos;t even bother coming to the US in thefirstplace. And did Obama listen? He did. He has also consistently said the same thing. In fact, there aretwo bills in the Senate already aimed at addressing precisely those problems. But Zucky B  as he&apos;s known to no one  felt a committee was in order anyway. So who has he got on this committee? A bipartisan team of political consultants, with  shock horror  at least two Republican strategists on it. You don&apos;t mean ? Perhaps. Mark Zuckerberg isn&apos;t ? He might be. He alsoheld a fundraiser at his home in Palo Alto earlier this year for Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. Who is ? Yup. A Republican. And one with an eye on running for the White House. Shocking. I know, right? Who would have thought a billionaire with a controversial approach to privacy would have rightwing sympathies? Do say: &quot;I liked him better when he just ran that poking service.&quot; Don&apos;t say: &quot;I would &apos;unlike&apos; him but I never &apos;liked&apos;him anyway.&quot;",

    "text": "Launched with little fanfare, Mars: War Logs is big on ideas and ambition. Sadly, though, those ambitions are outstripped by an inability to make good on them. Which is disappointing, since what&apos;s here has all the makings of a great RPG. Despite casting players into another civil war on the red planet something of a cliche now  its lore is well developed, with a wealth of politics and history to discover through back matter rather than weighty exposition. Combat is enjoyable, pairing breezy attacks with more powerful &quot;technomancy&quot; skills, while the character growth and crafting systems offer some imaginative results. However, archetypal characters with wildly inconsistent personalities, voice acting that ranges from acceptable to appalling and a plot that jumps between big moments with scant logic rob the game of its potential. A shame because, with more polish, this could have been fantastic.",

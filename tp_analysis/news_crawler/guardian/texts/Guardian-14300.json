    "text": "Above the pale reed beds of Hornifast Marsh, full-out daffodils sprawl on hedges and poke up through scrub on overgrown gardens bounded by pittosporum trees. Hardy varieties like Helio, King Alfred, Carlton and the double lent, or Van Sion, have remained vivid yellow for weeks, held back by the cold weather. The white petalled, lemon-centred White Lady narcissus is flowering but the pheasant-eye types, usually in flower by now, remain in bud. Primroses on roadside banks seem to have shrunk among the stunted bluebell leaves and, in adjoining fields, open to the cold wind from Dartmoor, lambs stay close to the warmth of their mothers. Recently, a grant-aided community orchard has been planted on a strip of land facing south where there remain a few gnarled pear and apple trees. Each new tree is encircled by tall wire mesh, which will protect shoots and bark from damage by deer and rabbits, and the rough grass is scattered with relics of old-fashioned daffodils once grown for market. This land, opposite lichen-covered trees in the shadowy woodland of Mount Ararat on Pentillie Estate, was renowned for the earliness of flowers and fruit grown on sheltered slopes close to the tidal river. On the steepest plots, erosion was counteracted by ploughing and dragging slumped earth uphill with a &quot;drawing up car&quot; (a contraption of a stripped-down car with its drive attached to a wooden axle and a wire rope that pulled the earth scoop or plough from the bottom of the slope). The most precipitous slopes are now shrouded in conifers; the numerous and productive cherry trees have rotted and fallen. Rare fragments of china found on the drives for pheasant shoots are the only reminder of the tons of dock dung (brought on barges upriver from Plymouth and Devonport) that was spread to increase the fertility of this difficult ground. Today, only the less steep ground is cultivated and, throughout the parish, ploughed fields have been scuffled, harrowed and drilled for spring barley in one pass, then rolled and fertilised in anticipation of the mild dampness typical of April.

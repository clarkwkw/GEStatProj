    "text": "As the former chief executive of the Joint Matriculation Board (GCE O- and A-levels), the Northern Examinations and Assessment Board and AQA (GCSEs and A-levels), and the first chair of Ofqual, I am appalled that we have a secretary of state for education who chooses to turn the clock back to a time when the success of the few was valued against the failure of the many (&apos;Ebacc&apos; to replace GCSE exams, 18 September). No one who is responsible for the education of young people should be proud to introduce a system which will result in a greater number of students leaving school with no qualifications. Education is about encouraging success and the raising of aspirations, not the writing off of a generation, which is what this new, untried, untested policy, based on prejudice and untruths, will bring about. Mr Gove claims that GCSE has lowered standards. Why? Because more students succeed than was ever the case in O-level, an examination intended for 20% of the population? The real question is why so many students in the past did not succeed. Were they incapable of attaining a qualification, or was the qualification designed in such a way that most students failed? All examination systems are artificial constructs which reflect the values and aspirations of society. In the mid-1980s a thoughtful Conservative secretary of state, Keith Joseph, chose, after long deliberation and consideration of many feasibility studies, to remove the artificial limitations of O-level and introduce a single system of examination at 16+ designed to encourage all students to make the most of their abilities and to examine what the students &quot;know, understand and can do&quot; (DfE 1988). For the first time this country had a qualification which gave credit to students&apos; achievements rather than defining most students as failures. We should be welcoming, not be alarmed by, the rise in the percentage of students gaining grade C (equivalent to the former O-level pass standard) and above. We are now faced with a situation where Mr Gove is intent on dismantling the system with little evidence of the fall in standards he claims and no consideration of the impact on education generally and more specifically on the students for whom he holds responsibility. Those of us with knowledge and long experience of examination systems here and elsewhere fear that these changes will harm a generation of students and be detrimental to this country.Kathleen Tattersall Ormskirk, Lancashire  The only thing that is clear about Mr Gove&apos;s proposals is his intention to limit access to higher education to an elite minority. Students with any form of educational special need will react with horror at three-hour exams designed to test knowledge using essay-style questions. The GCSE, with all its faults, opened up the possibility of attending university for so many students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Many of those dreams have been quashed by the coalition&apos;s decisions on student fees and the abolition of EMA and Aimhigher. Now a further nail in the coffin of working-class aspiration is being promulgated. This is a naked attempt to limit HE to those from elite schools and those who can pay. The most exasperating thing for many of my colleagues working in comprehensive schools is that Mr Clegg cannot see this and is content to let the Tories end educational social mobility on the whim of an education minister who knows little about education and cares even less.Simon GosdenRayleigh, Essex  I share the Guardian&apos;s opposition to a two-tier system that would lead to large numbers of pupils being unable to take an exam at 16. Let me put the record straight: Liberal Democrats secured that the new qualification, the English baccalaureate certificate, will be available to exactly the same number of children who currently sit GCSEs. Unlike the old O-level there will also be no cap on the number of pupils who can achieve a top grade. We also want to end the system of lower-tier papers which that cannot be awarded higher than a grade C and which pupils from poorer backgrounds remain more likely to sit than their wealthier peers. Another improvement will be a new provision for the very small number of children, including those with special educational needs, who don&apos;t sit GCSEs at the moment. They leave school without anything to show for their time and efforts, and Liberal Democrats in the coalition government are doing the right thing by ensuring they receive a statement that sets out their achievements and allows them to progress further. Both parties in the coalition have been working hard to find a way forward that combines the shared objective of greater rigour with the Liberal Democrat commitment to social mobility. Yesterday&apos;s announcement represents coalition government working as it should: working together to create the best deal for pupils and parents.Dan Rogerson MPCo-chair, Liberal Democrat parliamentary party committee on education  When Michael Gove&apos;s plan to replace GCSEs with O-levels and CSEs was leaked, Nick Clegg denounced it as leading to a two-tier system in which some children would get one sort of qualifications and others would get another. Thanks to the negotiating skills of this self-proclaimed champion of social mobility, this has now been replaced by a scheme in which some children get one sort of qualifications and many get no qualifications on leaving school at all. What a player, eh?Pete RuhemannReading  A return to a single end-of-year exam is a return to a system that penalises girl students. Coursework was introduced into the GCSE syllabus to create a more level playing field. Girls learn differently, and the pressured &quot;memory test&quot; exam format does not always suit them. Under the current system, girls have been thriving  indeed they are forging ahead of their male counterparts, something they were not doing under the one exam fits all. Sadly, I suspect this has played a part in this retrograde decision to revert to the former method of pupil assessment.Carol HedgesHarpenden, Hertfordshire  I have recently retired after 35 years teaching, and in my opinion the GCSE is far superior to the O-level, testing a far wider range of skills. What has always baffled me, though, is the whole notion that formal, traditional examinations are in any way useful preparation for working life. Should I have prepared my history lessons purely from memory? What sane employer would expect an employee to produce a report using no notes and no other information that does not come from memory? How sloppy, inaccurate and useless would the result be? Do Messrs Gove and Clegg ask their advisers to work like this?

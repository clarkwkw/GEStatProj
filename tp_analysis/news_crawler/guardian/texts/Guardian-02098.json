    "text": "Google is celebrating St David&apos;s Day with a doodle depicting a cartoon red dragon romping in a field of daffodils. The latest animation on the search engine&apos;s home page marks the Welsh patron saint&apos;s day, which is heralded by schools and cultural societies throughout the country. The tail of the dragon, which appears on the Welsh flag in less playful fashion, is wrapped around the &apos;l&apos; of Google, while he clutches the symbolic flower in one claw. It is customary in Wales to wear either a daffodil or a leek on 1 March for the occasion.",

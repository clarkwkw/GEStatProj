    "text": "Plans to restrict the use of powerful pest poisons will result in a large rise in the UK&apos;s rat population, according to environmental health experts. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is consulting on the use of rodenticides in the UK amid fears they are being overused. The executive has signalled that it is considering restricting their use to within five metres of a building  and then only when rats are &quot;having a significant impact on the building or its occupants&quot;. The HSE is concerned that the poisons are killing other wildlife  notably birds. There are also fears that the extensive application of rodenticides is resulting in rats becoming immune to the poisons. However, the National Pest Advisory Panel (NPAP) of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health has criticised the proposals. &quot;It is clear that a five-metre restriction will mean that effective treatments will not be possible in many instances,&quot; the panel claims in a submission to the HSE obtained by the Observer. A survey carried out by NPAP suggested that the five-metre restriction could result in &quot;over 100,000 rat infestations in UK cities and towns having to go untreated each year&quot;.",

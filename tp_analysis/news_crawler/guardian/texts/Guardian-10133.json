    "text": "Watch out, Google: if last month&apos;s search share loss carries on, then by February 2016 Microsoft&apos;s Bing will have overtaken you. For Google, the threat may not be colossal. Yet Experian, which owns the internet tracking company Hitwise, reports that in October for the first time in five years Google&apos;s search share in the UK dipped below 90%. That may not sound very big - and indeed the dip was tiny, to just 89.33% of all UK searches, compared to 90.74% in September, a fall of 1.41 percentage points. Microsoft&apos;s Bing - which has been a colossal moneypit for the company for years - meanwhile increased its share by 0.72 percentage points, to 4.71%. The rest of Google&apos;s loss mostly went to Yahoo, with a small amount going to Ask and to other sites.     If Google keeps losing UK desktop search share at the same rate, by February 2016 Microsoft's Bing would have overtaken it    Experian points out that the figure for Bing is a 2012 peak which has seen it raise its share of search by almost a percentage point in 2012. It&apos;s not much when your search engine is still pouring millions down the drain every quarter, but every little helps. The question is, why has Google dipped, and why has Bing improved, and why has only half the fall in Google gone to Bing? Experian tries to answer this by suggesting that the launch in October of Windows 8, where Bing is the default search engine, &quot;may have gone some way to increasing Microsoft&apos;s market share&quot;. But Windows 8 was only officially launched on 25 October, which hardly gives time for all those Windows 8 users to suddenly alter their behaviour from using Google to using Bing. In a statement, Experian Hitwise said: &quot;Clearly, Google still maintains a huge competitive edge over the other search engines in the UK market. There are 18 times more searches conducted on Google Sites than on all the other search engines combined. However, this is encouraging news for Microsoft as bing once again starts to gain some momentum and traction in the UK search market.&quot; That shows the scale of the challenge for Microsoft and the others - but still doesn&apos;t answer what changed in October. One point to note is that the figures also include searches done from smartphones and tablets if they are hooked into Wi-Fi network (as Hitwise gathers anonymous data via ISPs about what sites are being queried).  However, Google is the default search engine on virtually every smartphone and tablet too - apart from the BlackBerry PlayBook (Bing) and the Microsoft Surface (Bing again). However, the PlayBook has such a small installed base (fewer than 2m have shipped in its life since April 2011) that it couldn&apos;t have changed anything; and the Surface didn&apos;t start arriving in UK homes until the very end of October, and again wouldn&apos;t have shipped in sufficient numbers to make any difference. The arrival of Windows 8 devices this month, though, with their default search set to Bing, could have an effect for November - depending on whether users keep it as their default, or set it to Google. But what about Apple&apos;s new iOS 6, released in September, which brings Apple&apos;s new Maps, which don&apos;t use Google; it also brings the Siri functionality to the iPhone 5 and to some of the iPad devices. Could this make a difference?  The precise wording of the release is that &quot;The latest search stats show that 89.33% of all UK Internet searches were conducted on Google Sites.&quot; That&apos;s sites, not just the main search engine. Google Maps are part of Google sites, and people do searches there. If they update to iOS 6 and suddenly aren&apos;t doing searches on Google Maps - could that be it?  No, says James Murray, digital insights manager at Experian: the data only comes from the sites such as google.com, google.co.uk and so on. So no, nothing to do with iOS and maps. What is it really, then?  Murray says that the real key could be the way that people are now searching - often through social media sites. And which is the biggest social media site of the lot? Facebook. And which is the default search engine inside Facebook? That&apos;s right - Bing. &quot;That could be part of it,&quot; says Murray. &quot;People are looking these days for the best and most relevant search results. I think Bing, which has been a minor player, is starting to come to prominence. As it gains more traction I think we will see more searches coming from Bing.&quot; Does that mean he sees Bing accelerating its growth beyond just a percentage point or so per month? &quot;As the market continues to grow, I think it will become more prominent, particularly as it consolidates with Bing,&quot; Murray says.  OF course, the change that&apos;s really coming is the growth in mobile - which Experian Hitwise plans to start monitoring from January. Once we start to see those statistics it could be telling. Now, though, we - and Google - can only wait for the figures from November to see if this is a blip, or the start of a long-term trend.",

    "text": "The birth of one of the world&apos;s greatest inventors of toys is celebrated with a Google doodle featuring trains, tracks and other model railway paraphernalia. Frank Hornby, the inventor of Hornby model railways, Meccano and Dinky Toys, was born 150 years ago in Liverpool. He had no training as an engineer or craftsman but began making toys for his children in 1899. He cut out pieces of metal to construct bridges and buildings but realised that if he made interchangeable components, they could be used to make a variety of objects. He began marketing his Mechanics Made Easy toy sets in 1902 and these rapidly sold out. By 1907 he had registered the name Meccano. The kits were made in Liverpool and exported all over the world. Hornby became a millionaire and was elected Conservative MP for Everton in 1931. In 1934, he began selling Dinky Toys  robust metal vehicles  and also began developing railway sets. He died in 1936, two years before his company began selling Hornby Dublo model railways.",

    "headline": "Country diary archive, 4 May 1912: Stop this destruction of the pine marten", 
    "text": "A pine marten was slain a few days ago in Carnarvonshire; the news of its death reached me this morning. When is this stupid destruction of our rarest wild creatures going to cease? Sir Harry Johnston and other sportsmen-naturalists have repeatedly urged the preservation of this and other predacious mammals and birds, pointing out that our fauna belongs to the nation and not to the owners of land or to shooting tenants. Every species is a national monument, and if rare, deserves all efforts to prevent its extinction. The last strongholds of the vanishing marten are the wilder parts of Wales and the Lake District. Supposing that it is true that the marten is destructive to game, which I do not admit, has a game-preserver any right to sanction the destruction of national property because his sporting bag may be a little smaller in the shooting season? Fortunately there are many true sportsmen  amongst them the owners of some large estates in Cheshire - who value the rarer predacious mammals and birds more than their artificially protected game, and for years have put a stop to the destruction of rare visitors or residents. Game-preservation, in these cases, actually gives protection. It is to be hoped that others will imitate their good example, especially with regard to the marten, and save it before there is none left to save.",

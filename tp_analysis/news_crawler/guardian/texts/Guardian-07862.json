    "text": "After its gold medal touchdown in Mars&apos;s Gale crater, the Curiosity rover appears to be in perfect health as it begins to test its robot arm and drill sampling systems and, crucially, its ability to drive over the landscape. The intention is that it will soon begin a painstaking study of the crater floor as it meanders towards the base of Mount Sharp, some 8km away. Perhaps a year from now it should begin to explore the sedimentary layers in the foothills of Mount Sharp. Meantime, another of Nasa&apos;s probes is nearing the end of its study of Vesta. The Dawn spacecraft has been orbiting the asteroid since July last year, but its ion thrusters have been raising its orbit as it prepares to depart for its next destination, the dwarf planet Ceres. In fact, the departure was due this week but has been delayed until 5 September because of a problem with one of the reaction wheels it uses to maintain its precise pointing. Dawn is said to have exceeded the expectations of its scientists in mapping and studying the chemistry of Vesta, the third largest, and second most massive, body in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Vesta appears to be a rare if not unique survivor from the early solar system. It has its own iron core beneath a mantle and crust, the latter the source of no less than 6% of the meteorites that fall to Earth. Its average diameter of 524km compares with 952km for Ceres, and Dawn can expect to encounter a rather different world, perhaps one with an icy surface, when it arrives there is 2015.",

    "text": "      Just in time for Saint Patrick&apos;s Day, a touch of green comes to the Caturday morning video smile! Today&apos;s Caturday morning video smile is an unexpected gem. It features an African bullfrog, Pyxicephalus adspersus, and his boy. African bullfrogs are very large amphibians, with adult males weighing in at more than 2 kilos (4.4 pounds). These animals are voracious carnivores that eat anything that can be stuffed into the mouth. In this video, we watch a human sharing a touching moment with his beloved companion bullfrog as they play a video game together:               Visit njbadgrl&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  NOTE: the silly cat/pet/animal videos that are shared here on Saturday (Caturday) mornings are intended to amuse. This feature is designed to help hard-working and stressed-out people shed their professional faade so they can be better friends, companions, parents, family members and drinking pals to those in their personal lives. Any relationship between these videos and science or any scientific principle is sweet when I manage to present a solid connection to you, but is random, usually coincidental and mostly unintended.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist email: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

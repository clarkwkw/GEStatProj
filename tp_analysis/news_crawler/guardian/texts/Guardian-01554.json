    "text": "Can a folding bike ever be beautiful, even glamorous? They can, of course, be hugely practical, beautifully engineered, even  as London&apos;s furiously knee-pumping contingent of commuters turned semi-pro Brompton racers would attest  surprisingly nippy. But beautiful? Some might disagree but I&apos;d argue not. That&apos;s why, even as a foldie agnostic (I respect their utilitarian effectiveness but remain largely immune to their charms) I took up the chance to try out the iF Mode, made by Pacific, a Taiwanese firm which, despite being one of the world&apos;s biggest manufacturers of folding bikes, is only now for the first time, selling machines under their own name in the UK. While you might not have previously heard of the company, Pacific manufactures Birdy bikes, the German-designed, slightly Heath Robinson full-suspension devices available in the UK for some time, which acolytes hail as a sort of souped-up Brompton (with prices to match). Under their own name Pacific makes an eclectic range of folding and/or electric models, including the very flash-looking Reach, where the 8.2kg top-of-the-range model is supposedly regularly used in triathlons. The Mode, in contrast, is a decidedly urban affair, with full-sized wheels and a completely enclosed chain, designed for riding relatively short distances in everyday clothes. Central-hinged folders with full-size wheels are far from uncommon, but the Mode&apos;s big attraction are its striking, futuristic looks, plus a clever collapse system. It resembles something sketched by a 10-year-old given the brief to imagine the sort of bike you&apos;d one day ride on board a spaceship. The gleaming white monocoque frame attaches to both shiny, three-pronged wheels on just one side, a technique which, to me, still looks thrillingly exotic despite being around for years on Cannondale&apos;s Lefty mountain bike fork. A sense of sleekness is enhanced by having more or less all the cables and other mechanics enclosed. Unlike the version pictured, mine even had elegantly stiched, brown leather handlebar grips, with a matching saddle.      This isn&apos;t all show. The assymetric wheel attachment allows the frame and forks to fold neatly in on themselves, the wheels clunking tight together thanks to magnets in each hub. With the seat lowered and handlebars and pedals folded down you have a fairly compact package  nothing like as small as a Brompton but just about small enough to squeeze into a train&apos;s ground-level luggage rack (not the overhead ones, mind). My unfolding efforts generally looked like a man wrestling a wheeled robot, but this video from the company shows how effortless it looks when done properly:            It&apos;s not light  a shade under 15kg  and with just two gears which, oddly, you change by tapping a heel on either side of the bottom bracket, the pivot on which the cranks rotate, I expected a lumbering ride, not dissimilar to London&apos;s lead-framed, under-geared public hire bikes. The reality is, then, quite a shock. Maybe it&apos;s the monocoque construction, but the Mode is enormous fun to ride  responsive, balanced and surprisingly quick. I&apos;ve ridden road bikes with frames that felt more woolly. In fact for some people the ride might almost feel a bit on the harsh side. The two gears are spaced quite widely, giving enough leeway to tackle hills and still reach quite a pace on the flat. So will I be going out to buy one? Well, no. There are reservations. For starters the cyclist-around-town practicality is seriously undermined by the lack of mudguards or, as far as I could see, any way to attach them. There&apos;s little point in a bike keeping the oil off your trouser cuffs if it instead gives the trouser seat a striped spray of road grime.  And it&apos;s not cheap. Not at all. If the US list price is a guide, it&apos;s going to cost British buyers something around 1,700. For that money you could buy a decent Brompton and a carbon fibre road bike (if not the space to store them both). As an urban bike it might best suit a yacht-dwelling eco-friendly millionaire who wants something stowable, handy and stylish to ride from marina to casino (even eco-friendly millionaires can have fun).  And yet  I really, really like the Mode. It&apos;s elegant, it&apos;s sleek, it&apos;s futuristic, it&apos;s clever. Sometimes cycling can get too bogged down in practicality, functionality. There is an aesthetic culture in bikes but it&apos;s too often quite narrow, defined by things which look lightweight and shiny, not fun.  Someone has already described the Mode, perhaps inevitably, as the &quot;iPhone of bikes&quot;, something Pacific are presumably keen on given the lower-case &quot;i&quot; in the full title. While the comparison isn&apos;t exact (iPhones attained world domination because they are hugely flexible and easy to use, and they look great) but it would nonetheless be nice to think that Apple&apos;s signature marriage of beauty and usefulness could infect more of the cycling world.  Update: after publishing this blog post I was contacted by Pacific Cycles to say they do make mudguards which fit on the Mode, also a clip-on luggage ruck. Here&apos;s a pic of them attached:    ",

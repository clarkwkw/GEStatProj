    "text": "My good friend Ian King, who has died of cancer aged 57, made significant contributions to the national student union movement. Over the past 35 years there has rarely been a strategic move that has not benefited from his wise counsel and assistance. He was one of those responsible for creating one of the first effective central purchasing organisations for unions, which eventually became NUS Services Ltd (NUSSL). He was among the first managers to promote those unions offering activities that would supplement students&apos; work on their degrees  known as student development activities. He was a prime mover in the increased professionalism of union staff. Ian started his involvement in unions while he was an undergraduate at Stirling University. He went on to serve as general manager of the unions of York St John University, the Polytechnic of Wales (now the University of Glamorgan) and Manchester Polytechnic (now Manchester Metropolitan University). In 1987 he was appointed general manager at Birmingham University Guild of Students, where he enjoyed 10 happy, satisfying and innovative years. He was often consulted on important NUS issues by union officers who respected his opinion and could be sure of his integrity, confidentiality and availability. In 1997 he was appointed chief executive at NUSSL, responsible for a 60m annual purchasing budget. As with all his other posts, he introduced rapid change, increasing NUSSL&apos;s effectiveness and making it more accessible to its members. Eleven years ago, Ian was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He faced this with courage, fortitude and humour. He was determined that his activities would not be restricted and carried on working until 2010, despite ill-health. He continued with his many interests, mainly travel, sport and the arts. He was a keen cricket fan and a supporter of the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Ian gained most joy in the development of people, whether students and staff. He is survived by his wife, Becky, whom he married in 1975, and his daughter, Amy.",

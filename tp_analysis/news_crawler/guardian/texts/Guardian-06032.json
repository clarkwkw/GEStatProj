    "text": "The iPad&apos;s touch-screen and HD display make it a good fit for real-time strategy games, so it&apos;s nice to see developers taking advantage. Autumn Dynasty (4.99, iPad, BulkyPix) eschews graphical supremacy and hi-tech weaponry in favour of storybook battles created in a beautiful, handdrawn style. This is backed up with solid RTS gameplay  resources must be gathered to construct buildings, cannon fodder created to battle your foe. The missions are nicely varied, with stealth, combat and complex base building all present and correct. There&apos;s also both single- and multiplayer skirmish mode (via Bluetooth and Game Centre), which pits two opposing armies against one another, ensuring the title will keep you gripped for some time. Elsewhere, Bridge Constructor (1.99, iOS, Headup Games) offers simpler, but no less compelling entertainment. Just build a bridge strong enough for two cars (or trucks for extra points) to get across  at first using wood, but then more complex designs involving girders, concrete and suspension. Watching vehicles topple to their doom after some shoddy construction can be heartbreaking but with 30 challenges to get through it&apos;s a sight you&apos;ll become all too familiar with.",

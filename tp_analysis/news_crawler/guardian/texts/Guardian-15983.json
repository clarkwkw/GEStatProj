    "text": "Peter Wilby (They stole our school, 28 May) tells us that Summerhill is almost forgotten. Oh no, it&apos;s not. Every year since 1993 there has been an International Democratic Education Network conference, held in a different country each year, attended by up to a thousand people from 30 or more countries. At these conferences, where many varieties of democratic education are represented, Summerhill is held in great respect. Moo Baan Dek in Thailand, a village for 300 abused, abandoned or orphaned children, describes itself as a Buddhist interpretation of Summerhill. Sudbury Valley in the US takes the Summerhill attitude to learning one step further and has no timetabled lessons at all: it is widely imitated, particularly in the Netherlands and Germany. In Tamil Nadu ABL (activity-based learning), based primarily on Montessori methods but which has much in common with Summerhill, has been introduced into 37,500 primary schools, with spectacular success, including an improvement of over 25% in results for Tamil, English and Maths in the first year after its introduction. Compared with such initiatives, Summerhill, with its 70 pupils, may seem insignificant, but its importance is out of all proportion to its size. It has survived over 80 years and remains an inspiration to many.David GribbleCo-ordinator, IDEN",

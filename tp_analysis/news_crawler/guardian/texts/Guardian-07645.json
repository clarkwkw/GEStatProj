    "headline": "Why I took a working gap year", 
    "text": "When I tell people I&apos;m on my gap year I&apos;m normally met with questions about which exotic, faraway places I&apos;ve visited. Actually, I&apos;ve spent the time at home, working. I took an unexpected gap year after realising one month into my university course that I&apos;d chosen the wrong degree. It was too late in the day to swap subjects so I decided to defer entry until the following year and spend the next 10 months getting work experience and building up my savings. It looks like I&apos;m not the only one doing so. Although the number of students deferring entry to university has been in steady decline since 2007, those who are taking gap years are keen to spend the time boosting their employment skills. Applications to Year In Industry have doubled in the past couple of years, while gap year companies report that increasing numbers of students are interested in work-focused programmes. A working gap year doesn&apos;t mean spending months on a corporate internship. When I started looking for work I was eager to get a variety of experiences. Within weeks of being back home I found out that I had been offered a position at the Paralympics Games. I then secured work as a food prep assistant at sporting events and a tutor for 5-14 year olds  I even handed out fliers in Leicester Square. And, after volunteering with a local charity, I was offered a job as a personal support worker for adults with learning disabilities. My year might not rival my friends&apos; in terms of tropical weather or drunken escapades but it has changed my perspectives. Instead of travelling to different continents, I&apos;ve visited areas of London, my home town, I hadn&apos;t known before. Rather than riding on camels I&apos;m learning to drive a car. Spending 10 months working has helped me get a feel for what I&apos;d like to do in the future  I&apos;m now keen to work in HR or recruitment. When I start university in September I know that alongside studying and having fun, I need to start building the experience and skills needed to get on the career ladder. Writing dozens of job applications made me realise just how much students need to work hard to ensure that they stand out at interview. If you miss out on a place in clearing, a working gap year could boost your CV and give you time to think about reapplying. I&apos;ve finished my year excited about beginning a new course, making friends and getting involved in university life. Instead of feeling anxious and unprepared like last year, I can&apos;t wait to get there and settle in.",

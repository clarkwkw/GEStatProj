    "text": "A report published on Friday makes some surprising and rather alarming claims. Apparently, 60% of young people in custody say they have experienced a traumatic brain injury. To put this figure into perspective, the incidence of brain injury is typically higher in the population under 25 than in older people, but recent research cited in the report suggests it is higher still for under-25s who find themselves involved in the criminal justice system. It would be easy to read this and conclude that, via some complex but poorly understood mechanism, brain injury turns young people into criminals. In fact, it is depressingly likely that this precise claim will be made by some prominent media establishment, maybe before you&apos;ve even read this. However, the implications of the report are far more subtle and complex. The report, Repairing Shattered Lives: Brain Injury and its Implications for Criminal Justice, was written by Professor Huw Williams and commissioned by the Barrow Cadbury Trust for the Transition to Adulthood (T2A) Alliance. It is important to understand the rationale behind T2A, which &quot;promotes effective approaches for young people in the transition to adulthood (16-25 year olds) throughout the criminal justice process&quot;. As far as the criminal justice system is concerned, people aged over 18 are rational mature adults and should be treated as such when caught engaging in criminal behaviour. T2A argues that this approach is at best unhelpful, at worst actually making criminal behaviour more likely in the long term. We often forget that the majority of age limits imposed by society are arbitrary. A good example of this has been in the news recently with 16-year-olds potentially being allowed to vote in the referendum on Scottish independence, rather than limiting it to those over 18, as is standard in the UK. Age limits and restrictions rarely correspond to scientific evidence. A 16-year-old isn&apos;t any more resistant to the damaging effects of smoking than a 14-year-old. This isn&apos;t to dismiss age restrictions as irrelevant or illogical; they exist for very good reasons. For instance, in the strictest biological sense, the concept of an &quot;underage pregnancy&quot; is nonsensical  if a female is physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, then she is old enough to reproduce as far as nature is concerned. But society rightly recognises that just because someone is biologically capable of doing something, they are not necessarily mentally capable of doing it without causing damage to themselves or others. Ensuring an individual is mature enough to understand and handle the consequences of potentially damaging actions is why age restrictions exist. But this concept of &quot;maturity&quot; is where problems arise. As soon as someone reaches a legally determined age, they don&apos;t automatically mature overnight. There is no internal &quot;no/yes&quot; maturity switch that gets flipped. Biology is not binary, cognition even less so. But the criminal justice system works under the assumption that, once an individual is 18, they are mature enough to be considered a typical adult. T2A argues that this is not the case, and that young adults should be recognised as a distinct group by the criminal justice system, and their maturity, cognitive development and socioeconomic factors should be considered when processing them, up to and including sentencing. There is scientific evidence to support this claim. An extensive literature review by Birmingham University (also commissioned by the Barrow Cadbury Trust for the T2A) supports this view. Recent studies into post-adolescent brain development reveal that our brains continue to develop well into our 20s, and these developments are concerned with more complex abilities such as executive functioning and inhibition, which overrule our need for immediate reward, moderate our impulsive actions and regulate our emotions. These are what the majority of people would recognise as signs of maturity. But this applies to &quot;normal&quot; young adults. Repairing Shattered Lives highlights another factor that has a serious impact on the cognitive development and behaviour of young adults: brain injury and trauma. Head injury is a very serious matter. It is not like in films, when someone is knocked out in a fight only to come round a few minutes later, make a witty quip and carry on as if nothing had happened. Concussion is serious enough, even if it does not cause lasting damage. Any injury to the head that causes a period of unconsciousness should be taken seriously, as it could result in serious long-term injury. Given the complexity of the brain and uncertain nature of brain injury, the eventual consequences of traumatic brain injury can vary considerably, potentially leading to serious disorders such as schizophrenia.  Brain injury is potentially more damaging in younger people, as it could disrupt cognitive development. The developing brain can show remarkable resilience for such a complex and fragile organ, but in the cases of severe injury it is more a case of compensation than repair  the brain &quot;works around&quot; the damage, rather than undoing it, which means brain development can be disrupted in the long term. According to the report, these disruptions could lead to an increased tendency for criminal behaviour. As it states, &quot;Those without a TBI [traumatic brain injury] are likely to grow out of immature and antisocial behaviour by their mid-twenties, those with TBI are likely to continue to grapple with these issues throughout young adulthood and beyond&quot;. This does not mean that all young people who suffer brain injury go on to become criminals. Many do not. A police database of all young people who have suffered head injuries would be unnecessary, invasive and largely useless. And the relationship is also two-way. Those who are already more prone to risky behaviour such as criminal acts are more likely to find themselves in contexts where head injury occurs, meaning it could be the criminal behaviour that leads to the brain injury, not the other way round. But in young adults, brain injury increases the likelihood of eventual criminal behaviour. It&apos;s not a &quot;cause&quot;, per se. Overall, the evidence suggests that brain injury can be a significant variable in criminal behaviour, and as such should be considered when making decisions about sentencing and rehabilitation. However, at present, young people aren&apos;t screened for brain injury and thus are rarely if ever referred for necessary rehabilitation. As a result, the primary contact that many young people with brain injury have with service providers is via the criminal justice system, which is obviously ill equipped to deal with and treat brain trauma. The Shattered Lives report puts forward strong evidence for this to change. Young offenders should be screened for brain injury, and if present it should be addressed through relevant treatments and therapies when attempting rehabilitation. This approach could cut reoffending rates and eventually reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the criminal justice system. There are of course many complications to be considered when proposing such a reform. For example, no two brain injuries are exactly the same, so symptoms and appropriate treatments will vary considerably between individuals. There is also the matter of whether people trained to deal with young offenders are qualified or even capable of recognising the signs and consequences of brain injury.  How would the extent of the brain trauma be determined? It would be impractical, to say the least, to install an MRI scanner and qualified operators in every police station. And, regarding the maturity of young offenders, how would one determine the level of such an abstract concept in an individual? Many of these concerns could be addressed. Work is already under way on tools for determining mental state and maturity, such as targeted questionnaires, and training in their use could be provided. But then, this would rely on offenders being open and honest with the authority figures responsible for prosecuting them, which would require a degree of maturity and control. The whole point of the process is that they may lack these things. There is no quick and easy solution to the issues raised in the report, but a greater awareness of the effect developmental maturity and brain injury can have on criminal behaviour in young adults can only be of benefit to the criminal justice system, and society as whole. I&apos;ve written before about how damaging it can be to demand certain types of behaviour from teenagers (and punishing them based on this) without taking into account the physiological and cognitive changes they are undergoing. This report only emphasises that point further. Nobody is arguing that young offenders shouldn&apos;t be punished for the crimes they commit. But taking into account the effect that developmental maturity and brain injury can have on their behaviour could greatly reduce the likelihood of the punishment being needed again.

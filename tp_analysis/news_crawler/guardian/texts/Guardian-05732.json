    "text": "What youll learnPharmacy will teach you all about medicines, their uses, and how to manage and dispense them. You will study the origin and chemistry of drugs, the preparation of medicines, their uses and effects, and good pharmacy practice. You will also need to keep up to date with new drugs that come on the market.  Pharmacology, meanwhile, focuses on the ways medicinal drugs are delivered, the effects they have on the body and whether new ones could work better. You will study cells and tissues in detail, taking modules in organic chemistry, control mechanisms and physiology. You could also investigate specific diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimers disease, or HIV and Aids, to examine infection rates and the effects of drugs in combating symptoms.   interactive   How youll learnPharmacy is a full-on, 9 to 5 degree, so expect to spend time in lectures, seminars, laboratories and on hospital wards or in pharmacies. By the time you graduate you will have mastered a substantial body of knowledge, and should be raring to get stuck into your pre-registration year (this is a requirement after graduation, if you want to work as a professional pharmacist).  You will also need to complete a final-year research project, which will require time management and the ability to work independently. What are the entry requirements?Entry requirements vary. Courses are competitive and will often require chemistry, and perhaps biology or another science subject, or maths.   interactive   What job you could doUnemployment rates among pharmacists are low, and the majority of graduates will get jobs in NHS hospitals or in the local high street chemist. Some will venture into industry or stay in universities doing further research or teaching the next crop of students. An obvious career choice for pharmacology graduates is in industry, either in the lab or working more in marketing or quality checking. If this doesnt appeal, jobs in forensic science or other health-related work are possibilities, or you could undertake further research or train to become a teacher.",

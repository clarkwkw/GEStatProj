    "text": "Its been six years since the Guardian threw the doors open to a group of esteemed scientists and science writers, and gave them pretty much complete editorial freedom to write about whatever they wished. Over those six years, writers have come and gone. Like science itself, the network never stays stagnant - and now more changes are afoot. Last year, we put a call out for new bloggers to broaden our coverage of palaeontology. The response was fantastic, and since the launch of Lost Worlds Revisited, the blog has gone from strength to strength. But while the story of life on Earth has fairly substantial chapters about dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plants and invertebrates, one story is still being written: the story of us.  In the next stage of expansion of the science blog network here at the Guardian, we want to start a new archaeology and anthropology blog. Were looking for exceptional writers who have a command of any relevant sub-discipline, from ethno- or osteoarchaeology to biological or cultural anthropology. If you have a passion for our shared past, and youre able to bring cutting-edge research to life for a diverse audience, we want to hear from you.  Likewise, if you know someone who you think might be a brilliant addition to the blog network, give them a nudge in our direction - or let us know in the comments below.  Lastly, if you have an idea for a blog that doesnt relate to archaeology and anthropology, then hold off for now - well have some announcements for you in the new year.  Applications for this process are now closed.",

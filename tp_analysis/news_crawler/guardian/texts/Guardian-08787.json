If We have reason to believe your entry is not your own work, if a person objects to the inclusion of a video in which they are featured being included in the Competition, or if your entry otherwise breaches this paragraph 11, then We may not consider it and may disqualify it. 12. We may also disqualify Your entry if You do not meet the entry criteria, You are not eligible to enter the Competition, You cannot be contacted or You do not respond within 5 days of being contacted by Us in relation to your entry. In the event of disqualification, we may select a new longlisted entry, runner up or winner in accordance with the selection processes below. Picking the longlisted entries, runners up and winner  13. A panel of judges from the Promoters, including an independent judge will on 22 January 2013 choose twenty longlisted entries from all the valid Competition entries using the criteria in paragraph 17 below. The Promoters will notify the longlisted entrants within one week of that date and request verification of their eligibility to enter the competition. 14. All longlisted entries will be posted on the GNM Site from 29 January 2013. From that date until 11.59pm on 26 February 2013, members of the public may vote for their favourite longlisted entry. Members of the public will only be allowed to vote once. The four finalists will be the four entries that have obtained the most independent votes. If two or more entries receive the same number of votes and tie for first, second, third or fourth place, all such entries will become finalists. 15. A panel of judges, including a judge independent of the Promoters, will assess the entries of the finalists on 20 March 2013 and select the winner using the criteria in paragraph 17 below. 16. A Live Final event will be held on 20 March 2013 at GNM&apos;s premises in London. All four finalists will be invited to attend, along with one guest each. Finalists will be given more details about the Live Final nearer the time, but at that event the finalists will be required to give a short presentation to the judges on the ideas behind their video and why they chose their topic. The overall winner will be announced at the event. The other finalists shall be the runners-up. If a finalist is unable to attend the event they will no longer be eligible to win and a new replacement finalist may be chosen who has received the next most amount of independent votes. 17. When choosing the longlisted entries, runners up and subsequently the winner, the judges will be looking for entrants who are clearly on top of their subject, who can explain what&apos;s important about it in a very short time, who deliver with verve and passion, and who leave us wanting to find out more. The judges&apos; decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into. 18. Full details of the judging process and the judges are available on request to students@guardian.co.uk. The Prizes 19. One winner will win a cash prize of 9,000 to pay for tertiary education fees and student living costs. This amount is currently sufficient to pay the maximum full year&apos;s fees for a UK national in a UK university; for students paying a lower tuition fee, the balance can be used for other costs directly relating to their education. 20. Three runners up will each win a voucher for Oxford University Press books of their choice to the value of 250. 21. The winner will be notified by The Promoters on the night of the Live Final. If a winner rejects their prize, then the winner&apos;s prize will be forfeited and The Promoters shall be entitled to select another winner. 22. The prizes will be sent to the runners up by the Promoters by 6 April 2013. The winner&apos;s prize will be paid within 14 days of the Promoters&apos; receipt of confirmation from the winner that s/he is either: a. already enrolled and participating in a course at a UK tertiary institution as at the date of the Live Final; or b. (in the case of a student who had applied for a place at a UK tertiary institution but was not yet enrolled) now enrolled and participating in a course at a UK tertiary institution for the autumn term 2013. The winner shall provide the Promoters with any reasonably required supporting evidence to this effect. If the winner does not meet this eligibility requirement, s/he shall be disqualified and the prize shall be shared in equal parts between the runners up, provided each also meets this eligibility criteria. 23. The prize cannot be exchanged or transferred by You and cannot be redeemed by You for any other prize. 24. We retain the right to substitute runners up prizes with other prizes of similar value in the event that the original books chosen by the runner up are not available. Some other rules  25.

    "headline": "David Cameron turns hit man over top energy and climate job", 
    "text": "&quot;Just when I thought I was out ... they pull me back in.&quot; I had thought the compromise plan for tackling the nation&apos;s energy and climate change problems had ended the gangland warfare behind the Westminster scenes. I was wrong. Today, the Financial Times revealed that David Cameron has blocked the appointment of David Kennedy, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), as the new permanent secretary of the department of energy and climate change. Perhaps that seems undramatic to you, just a bit of Whitehall gossip. Think again: this is the political equivalent of a mafia hit and Kennedy got whacked. The first reason this is important is the direct and highly unusual political interference by the prime minister in the running of the civil service. The second is that Decc, already a mob sorely missing the direction of a boss, has to steer through the energy bill, one and the most complex and important pieces of legislation in a generation. Every single person in this country is affected by it, in their pocket, in whether they live in an affordably warm home and in whether the growing impacts of global warming - such as flooding - can be limited. Kennedy was unanimously selected as the best qualified candidate by an eminent panel and endorsed by the head of the civil service and the energy secretary Ed Davey. &quot;In four years at the head of the CCC, Kennedy&apos;s intellectual rigour has won the support of both industry and the green lobby. This would have qualified him very strongly to tackle the many challenges facing Decc,&quot; said Tim Yeo, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee that scrutinies Decc. &quot;I am extremely disappointed that the appointment of such a well qualified candidate has apparently been blocked.&quot; Why Cameron then blackballed his appointment, he won&apos;t say. But it&apos;s not hard to guess: Kennedy is seen as too &quot;green&quot;. In fact, far from being a treehugger, he is an ex-World Bank economist who is charged providing the legally-required advice to government on the least-cost, least-risk route to meeting the UK&apos;s legally-binding climate change targets.  The problem is that the least-cost, least-risk route does not involve enough gas for the fracking-obsessed chancellor George Osborne and too many onshore wind farms for the vocal fringe of Tory backbenchers who have put Cameron&apos;s head in a spin. More precisely, Osborne loathes the target to cut the UK&apos;s emissions by 50% by 2025, now in law, and wants to review that in 2014. Osborne also hates the idea of a target to clean up electricity by 2030, thought investors love it, and won his fight to keep it out of the energy bill. Both these targets are backed by the CCC and Kennedy, giving Cameron and Osborne good reason to keep him away from the levers of power at Decc. The double tragedy is that Decc is a ministry in crisis and needs a leader now. Insiders I have spoken to talk of the appalling relations between ministers and the previous permanent secretary, Moira Wallace, who resigned unexpectedly in June. Others talk of a department &quot;without direction&quot;, &quot;driven by ideology not facts&quot; and &quot;unmotivated and inward looking&quot;. It is being temporarily run by the man behind the Green deal, which is a &quot;total mess&quot; according to insiders. And remember, these are the people who will set how much you pay for energy for the coming decades. Reassuring it is not. The reaction to Cameron&apos;s blackball has been suitably scathing. &quot;It is hard to read it as anything other than an effort to stop the climate change department from being run by a respected expert who actually supports strong action on climate change,&quot; said WWF&apos;s Keith Allott. &quot;It would be completely wrong if Cameron has been meddling with the civil service appointment process just to block someone who disagrees with his government&apos;s failure to commit to decarbonise the power sector by 2030,&quot; said Luciana Berger, Labour MP and shadow minister for climate change.  Nick Butler, writing for the FT, said: &quot;Francis Maude, the civil service minister is said to have wanted a businessman to run the department. At least three were approached, and one was shortlisted.&quot; But Kennedy was judged the best, perhaps because he really knows what he is talking about. The news that Osborne has appointed Neil O&apos;Brien, director of Policy Exchange and critic of renewable energy and strong action on climate change, as adviser only shows that the chancellor&apos;s advice will be as narrow as ever. We have learned something new though. Until now, Cameron - the &quot;vote blue, go green&quot; leader, has simply operated a climate omerta, allowing doubt to surround his real views. Now, by shooting down Kennedy&apos;s appointment, we have the smoking gun. The next general election will show if he has shot himself, and the fast-growing green economy, in the foot.",

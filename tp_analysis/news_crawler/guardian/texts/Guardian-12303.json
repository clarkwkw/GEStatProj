    "text": "Sixty years ago today, floods and gales shattered the east coast and its communities. Every East Anglian of a certain age still remembers the 1953 floods, when sea walls were breached in over 1,000 places, and more than 300 people died. Three events combined: full moon, a deep trough of low-pressure that sucked up the sea by an extra foot, and violent gales which lasted many hours. The high tide came down the North Sea as a giant standing wave, and the coast would at first be threatened, and then in a few short hours overtopped and soundly beaten. By 5pm, sea water crashed through the dunes in Lincolnshire, and crushed every automatic tide gauge in the Wash. The evening train from Hunstanton ran headlong into a wall of water a mile inland, and was stranded for six hours. Forty bungalows, home mainly to American servicemen and their Norfolk wives, were swept away: 65 drowned.            Six-metre waves burst through Sea Palling, and rushed inland. Yarmouth was engulfed, and Southwold cut off. At sunset in Harwich, it was difficult to stand in the wind, and heavy seas crashed deep into the harbour and estuaries. By late evening, all down the Essex coast the sea had covered the saltings, and was working away at the sea walls themselves, filling rabbit burrows and badger setts, loosening cracks in the clay, undermining foundations. People were sleeping behind 1,000 year-old sea walls, trusting to history. The walled fortress of Essex was under siege, and soon would surrender. The greatest loss of life was on Canvey Island, once grazing marsh and then reclaimed from the sea. At the time, most residents lived in bungalows and chalets. All were enclosed by miles of feeble earthen sea walls. At midnight, a river board man went up for his last check. In the hard silver moonlight, he saw a fleet of water where there should be islands to mainland Leigh, and the sea was lapping at his feet. He rushed down, and with a colleague began banging on doors. &quot;The tide is coming,&quot; they shouted. But with a bang the sea walls crumpled. It was the speed that was shocking. With the wind roaring, and icy North Sea inside, the electricity shorted and no one knew how it would end. The river board man was overtaken, and he grabbed a post, and stayed up to his chest in winter water all the night. Across the road, an elderly couple he had warned climbed on to a wardrobe in their tiny bedroom, but later it gave way in the pitch dark, and the woman tumbled down and drowned. Like so many others, the husband was quite helpless, even though he was so close. In another bungalow, a family with nine children under 16 years of age tried to climb into the roof space when the water burst in. Then the table collapsed, and the mother was left standing in the water, holding on to the two youngest boys. During the endless night, both died in her arms. There was nothing she could do. All the clocks stopped between 1.42 and 1.47 am as the rising water passed mantelpieces. All survivors would remember this night for all their lives. In all, 58 people died on Canvey. Many remember the millions of earthworms, drifting and swaying in the water, killed by the salt. Canvey was closed to prevent looting, and large S&apos;s chalked on doors after houses and shops had been searched. &quot;The sea&apos;s triumph,&quot; wrote county archivist Hilda Grieve, &quot;had been stunning.&quot; Now comes a new risk  our consumption of resources is adding to the power of nature. Some see it coming, many are in denial. Warm water takes up more volume than cold, and climate change will raise sea levels this century. In the pre-industrial era, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 280 ppm; by the end of 2012, they had reached 392 ppm. At this annual rate of 2 ppm per year, three decades hence will see global concentration exceed 450 ppm, causing seas to rise by 0.5 to 1.7 metres. This may only be the start. To restrict concentrations to 450 ppm, a 50-85% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is required by 2050. They did fall by 1% in 2009, but that was because of the recession, and no one wants that to continue. There is little current prospect of stabilisation of emissions let alone of atmospheric concentrations , and some now talk of +4C as possibility this century. Major changes in our behaviours and uses of non-polluting technologies are needed. A 4C mean increase in temperature would raise sea levels by 0.6 to 2.9 metres. This would force displacement of nearly 200 million people from cities by the sea. Domestically, climate change has brought alternating drought and floods, and the policy focus has turned inland. The drenching rains of 2012 poured off hills, saturated fields, burst banks, filled reservoirs. Flood warnings became common. Yet we should not forget the salt. Money is short, and has been diverted from the coasts to rivers. Let it go, say some. Leave the sea walls be. For an island nation, this could be a mistake.

    "text": "Well, hol. Irather like the look ofthis one. Imean, it&apos;s obviously a Seat Leon  a not unattractive family hatchback, but hardly one to stir the soul; showing its age a bit, too, to be honest. But this is the special sporty Supercopa edition. In Spain, where Seats come from, of course, the Supercopa is a football competition played between the team that won La Liga and the team that won the Copa del Rey. In other words, this is the Seat FA Community Shield. Suddenly it doesn&apos;t look so hot. To be fair, football isn&apos;t really the right sport to be talking about here. The Supercopa was developed and built in conjunction with Seat&apos;s motor sport division (which has a couple of World Touring Car Championship titles to its name). And it looks like it. The Seat Sport people have given it a makeover: new bumpers front and rear, side skirts (phwoar), and  spoiler alert!  a tailgate spoiler. Plus chrome-tipped twin exhausts, a set of BBS 18-inch alloys wheels I do apologise, I appear suddenly to be writing for Max Power magazine (even though it closed last year). But those alloys and the Supercopa bodykit do that to a man, bring out his inner hoon. Right, I&apos;m off to Southend, to cruise up and down Marine Parade, or perhaps to find a car park where young people are hanging out with their cars, doing bad  possibly even illegal  things. Oh, hang on, perhaps I&apos;m not. I&apos;m turning round  not a handbrake turn, or a half-doughnut, but a proper three-point turn, with plenty of checking each way for traffic. I&apos;m not going to Southend after all. I&apos;m going to Sainsbury&apos;s instead. Because it&apos;s not quite the car I thought it was. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s not abad car to drive. If it wasn&apos;t for the bodykit, you&apos;d be pretty impressed. The ride is firm but not impossibly so, it corners well, the two-litre turbo diesel engine has plenty of torque but is impressive rather than outlandish Oops, drifting back into Max Power territory. OK, in Guardian Weekend language, it&apos;s a sheep in wolf&apos;s clothing. No, not a sheep, somethinga bit better than asheep. Achamois, or an alpaca maybe. And in lion&apos;s clothing, because that&apos;s what Leon means, in Spanish. Leon Trotsky? Not revolutionary enough. Leon Brittan? Not that conservative. Leon-ardo? Not ingenious enough. I&apos;m thinking more Leona, as in Lewis  nice to look at, but a bit bland underneath, disappointing. Too mean? Back to the beginning, then: it&apos;s a Seat FA Community Shield. And I&apos;m not sure one of them is worth 22 and ahalfthousand quid.

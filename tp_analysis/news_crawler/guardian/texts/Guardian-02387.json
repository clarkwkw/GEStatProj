    "text": "It&apos;s not often a game is released that can truly claim to be art, but Sir Benfro&apos;s Brilliant Balloon (Apple App Store, Tim Fishlock, 69p) deserves the title. The gameplay is gloriously simple  reminiscent of the browser Helicopter title so popular a decade ago. The afro&apos;d Sir Benfro hangs from his balloon, always floating forward, and the task is to guide the naturalist up and down, avoiding obstacles to reach the end of the level. The balloon is powered by Light Emitting Daves, magical fireflies  the first of many wondrous discoveries  that get worn out over time and by collisions, so the glowing insects must be collected as you travel. It&apos;s not complicated, or particularly challenging, but the Terry Gilliam-esque flourishes and bizarre creatures encountered along the way make it a pleasure to play. From the wiggling Piblokto to the Brackle McSturdy, these novel obstacles are lovingly described and lift the game above the usual flurry into an altogether more interesting experience.",

    "text": "The battle over how the UK should meet its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 is at its most feverish in the energy sector. Lobbying by energy companies to channel government policy towards serving their best interests is intense. This would not be a problem if ministers and civil servants wielded their power to base policy on evidence rather than influence, but Britain has moved well past this point. There is genuine uncertainty about who is in control of the overall energy policy and which stakeholder  ie EDF, the French nuclear company or the non-nuclear companies in the &quot;big six&quot; and major energy users  has the most traction with the different ministries, in particular the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), and the Treasury. Consumer interests are at the bottom of the pile. EDF set out as early as 2006 what was needed for new nuclear power to be built in Britain and this has now been put in place via the electricity market reform (EMR) process. This is despite a tidal wave of criticism, not least because the number of secondees in Decc from EDF and British Gas/Centrica  a fellow member of EDF&apos;s nuclear consortium  far outweigh any other company. The other main lobby is that which argues that the cheapest way to decarbonise our energy system is to move to gas, rather than the low carbon generation of nuclear and renewable energy. This is a short-term economic view, supported by the Treasury, which conveniently leaves others to deliver and pay for the long term, more difficult solution to climate change. In practice, this means that Decc does all it can to support nuclear power while the Treasury attempts to support gas as best it can by moving as much risk of investment away from UK PLC to the nuclear companies. At the same time, both lobbies relentlessly undermine renewable energy thereby making sure their deployment is as limited as possible so that nuclear power or gas can step in. This is not only confusing but it has led to wildly one-sided policies from the government. For example, a letter in 2010 from National Grid set out its decision to not require new nuclear power plants to pay for the additional costs they will impose on the electricity network. The letter ended saying this was because, at 160m per plant per year, it would make nuclear power uneconomical. Renewable energy, on the other hand, has to pay the costs of connections. Or take the EU Renewable Energy directive, intended to help renewable electricity by ensuring that it is &quot;taken&quot; before generation from other sources of electricity, thereby reducing investment risk. The UK has mostly sidestepped the spirit by letter of law actions. However, recently even the letter of the law has been broken with National Grid favouring nuclear over wind in its management of energy at peak times of demand. There has been a barrage of ill-informed media reports of the extra costs that renewable energy currently, and will, add to energy bills. Not only has Decc, or the Treasury, not clarified those costs (about 7% of total price rises between 2004-10, or 30 on the average energy bill) but George Osborne has irresponsibly fuelled that debate with his &quot;we&apos;re not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business&quot; rhetoric. Meanwhile, our nuclear liabilities are 6.93bn annually, or around 350 per year for each household. What is so depressing about this is that the lobbies for a continuation of our current energy system  effectively lobbying against a sustainable and secure energy system  appear to be pushing at an open door in Whitehall. Unlike most European countries, we in the UK do not have a state-funded research institute for renewable energy and energy efficiency whose role it is to provide information to government. Renewable energy in the UK simply does not have the same level of credibility as is the norm in Europe, and increasingly around the world. Partly this is the relentless onslaught of the lobbies. But it is also something to do with the expertise and current ethos embodied in our civil service. It has been independent advisers the Committee on Climate Change and Ofgem, Britain&apos;s energy regulator, that have clarified the costs of renewable energy in Britain  not our civil service or our ministers. On the contrary, our ministers have been part of the misinformation process. We have seen the effect of hands-off regulation in our banking, financial sectors and media  without intervention from ministers and civil servants. We must not make the same mistakes within energy because climate change, unlike an economy, will not recover.",

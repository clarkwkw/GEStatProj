    "text": "Let&apos;s get straight to the nuts and bolts of it  players already well-versed in the Armored Core series will be right at home with this fifth &quot;proper&quot; instalment in the franchise. However, those who have never so much as glanced at a giant robot before might be drowned in so much jargon and futuristic militarism that there will be a temptation to give up before getting to the good stuff. Wade through the confusing opening, though, and you&apos;ll find a remarkably solid, if resoundingly challenging mecha adventure. The towering bipedal war machines populating the game are staggeringly customisable  right down to the paint apps  and a hearty single-player mode is bolstered by an even more robust online multiplayer option, allowing you to form teams and fight overterritoryin ongoing battles. Armored Core V looks fantastic and is thoroughly entertaining, but its impenetrability may prove too much for all but the faithful.",

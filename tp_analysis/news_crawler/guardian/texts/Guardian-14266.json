    "text": "Moving forward from its original incarnation, this stealth shooter has skilfully adapted the CryEngine 3 technology developed for Crysis. Unsurprisingly, then, the environments, whether lush jungles or war-torn cities, look stunning. Weapons and ballistics are also exceptionally detailed, with target range, wind, bullet drop, touch-sensitive trigger and recoil all impacting on head shot accuracy. Which is replayed in glorious, blood-splattered slo-mo. Here, the head shot is the money shot. Crucially, this sequel is more playable than its horribly difficult predecessor and single player offers a decent storyline, with some enjoyable sniping action  but it&apos;s not enough. The checkpoints remain so widely spaced that there are frustrating moments of repeatedly revisiting tough stretches, while the claustrophobically linear path, where stepping outside a predetermined route provokes stern warnings to return to your mission or fall back to the last checkpoint, is simply irritating.",

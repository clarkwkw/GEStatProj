    "text": "Offering a speculative look at near-future military operations, Tom Clancy&apos;s Ghost Recon: Future Soldier aims to re-energise the long-running Ghost Recon series with the barest hint of sci-fi. As far as tone goes, it&apos;s a success  an arsenal built upon current developments in combat technology means the game remains grounded rather than far-fetched; victory coming from putting skills to best use rather than employing overwhelming firepower. Its refined cover system and simplified squad commands help deliver a much more streamlined experience, while a nice extra touch for Kinect users is the ability to modify weapons with gestures, Minority Report-style. However, the story campaign serves more as training for the multiplayer modes than as a robust challenge in its own right  almost all the emphasis rests on the game&apos;s online components. That said, the target audience is likely looking for precisely that level of competition and will be well served by the variety on offer.",

    "text": "Some gamers might interpret Far Cry 3 as a treatise on the precarious nature of our hold on sanity. By stranding the game&apos;s protagonist, Jason Brody, on a tropical island and forcing him to adopt brutal tactics to survive, the game, they may argue, is putting to the test the theory that mankind, stripped of pacifying comforts, would soon descend into barbarism. Equally, it might be interpreted as a remarkably competent shooter with expansive survivalist and crafting elements, but either way, this third instalment in the series is a tremendously deep and involving game. Like its predecessors, Far Cry 3 offers a vast environment to explore and no real rules as to how you do so. Enemies can be dealt with through stealth, brute force or strategic assaults  if anything, the freedom is almost paralysing at times. Story missions chart Jason&apos;s growth from terrified tourist to respected tribal warrior, while plenty of side tasks provide ample reason to explore the gorgeous, yet deadly, locale. Integrating ranked missions into the solo campaign adds a nice competitive streak, alongside dedicated multiplayer and co-op modes. Precariously balancing mature, philosophical content with the cathartic appeal of blowing bad guys&apos; heads off  and buoyed by some fantastic performances, notably Michael Mando&apos;s exceptional turn as cruel, psychotic arch-villain Vaas  Far Cry 3 immediately marks itself out as the best in the series.",

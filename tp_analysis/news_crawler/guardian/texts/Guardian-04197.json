    "text": "What will I learn?You don&apos;t have to want to become a lawyer to study law. It&apos;s one of those subjects that you can take for purely academic reasons  you may be interested in the legal processes and like the US television series The Good Wife, or you could study law as a precursor to professional qualifications that could lead you to qualify as either a solicitor or barrister. Either way, a degree in law will give you an understanding of how the legal system operates in England and Wales, Scotland, or Ireland  or perhaps more than one. Compulsory modules for a qualifying law degree leading to the necessary exemptions to qualify as a lawyer will include: criminal law; contract law; land law; EU law; constitutional and administrative law; The Law of Negligence. But you can also expect to study a wide range of additional subjects, whether that be commercial law, criminology, family law, human rights law, labour law, media law, international law and many more besides.  Expect to examine plenty of past cases, visit the local law courts and potentially even practise interviews with fictional clients. Most law schools will also offer students the opportunity to get involved with mooting, whereby students get to develop their advocacy skills by presenting arguments as counsel on fictitious legal problems before a moot judge.  Those aspiring to a career as qualified lawyers will usually need to have taken the foundation legal subjects as part of their law degree before proceeding to vocational training and further training with a law firm or in a barrister&apos;s chambers.  Law can also be studied as part of a joint degree with other disciplines such as business, economics, politics or history, that will also often be qualifying law degrees. Law can also frequently be studied as a four-year degree with a year spent on a work placement or studying law in another European country. What skills will it give me?You will be expected to develop good research, analysis and presentation skills; demonstrate a good understanding of the legal systems studied; and make reference to past cases to back up your arguments. You will have good teamwork and communication skills  especially if you want to stand up in court and be listened to  but also the ability and commitment to wade through a lot of documents and draw out what you need. You should be able to demonstrate your ability to problem-solve and assess the performance of yourself and others. Those aspiring to a career as qualified lawyers will usually need to have taken the foundation legal subjects as part of their law degree before proceeding to vocational training and further training with a law firm or in a barrister&apos;s chambers.  There may not be a chance within your course for legal work experience. However, acquiring work experience in the legal sector is much sought after and increasingly important  What job can I get?After passing your professional qualifications and completing your on-the-job training, you will be in a position to compete for a job as a solicitor in a City law firm or a smaller law firm or as a barrister  either way you can expect to command an attractive salary. If you took law for academic purposes, but now fancy a chance to try it out as a practitioner, you can take a conversion course (if you haven&apos;t taken the required foundational modules) and then begin your formal training. For those who want a career outside the practicing legal sector, you will have a healthy skills set to offer employers, and law graduates are increasingly to be found in a wide variety of fields such as accountancy, banking and finance, the civil service, the police, local government, financial services, thearmed forces, management, journalism, or academia. What will look good on the CV? The ability to judge the merits of particular arguments. Independent research on areas of law not previously studied The ability to demonstrate knowledge of the legal system Mooting experience and work experience, including via working with your university law clinic.",

    "text": "Relief agencies are bracing themselves for an influx of refugees to neighbouring countries as the conflict in Mali escalates following the arrival of French troops. Since France intervened by sending warplanes and troops to stop an Islamist offensive into southern Mali, humanitarian organisations have reported an increase in the number of Malians leaving the country. Almost 1,500 have crossed into Niger, Mauritania and Burkina Faso since 11 January amid worries the figures could multiply if the fighting persists. &quot;Refugees are telling us they fled the military intervention, the absence of subsistence opportunities and basic services, and the imposition of sharia law,&quot; said Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, in Geneva on Tuesday. UNHCR, other UN agencies and national authorities have prepared contingency plans to cope with 300,000 internally displaced Malians and 407,000 refugees. The number of Malian refugees in the region is estimated to be 144,500, with around 54,100 in Mauritania, 50,000 in Niger, 38,800 in Burkina Faso and 1,500 in Algeria. Small groups are also in Guinea and Togo. Most of the refugees are arriving in underdeveloped and difficult to reach areas. Poor infrastructure and harsh conditions, including flooding during the rainy season, make the situation even more difficult. The UNHCR has been registering refugees in Niger; once this is done, some of the estimated 50,000 Malian refugees will be moved away from the dangerous border areas. The internally displaced population inside Mali, including people who fled last year, and those newly displaced in the past week, is estimated by Mali&apos;s Commission on Population Movements to be 228,918. They are mainly in the capital, Bamako, Sgou, Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso and Mopti. Mdecins sans Frontires (MSF) has called on all parties to the conflict to respect the safety of civilians and leave medical facilities untouched. It said bombardments started again on Sunday morning in Douentza, a town to the north-east of Mopti, in central Mali. &quot;Because of the bombardments and fighting, nobody is moving in the streets of Douentza and patients are not making it through to the hospital,&quot; said Rosa Crestani, MSF emergency response co-ordinator. &quot;We are worried about the people living close to the combat zones and we call on all the parties to the conflict to respect the safety of civilians and to leave medical facilities untouched.&quot; MSF said that during the night between 10 and 11 January it had received several phone calls about dead and injured people in the central town of Konna, including civilians. The seizure of Konna by Islamists precipitated France&apos;s military intervention as it feared the rest of the country would fall into the hands of the Islamists. Oxfam, which is providing humanitarian assistance in the Gao region of northern Mali, called for UN monitors to be &quot;urgently deployed&quot; in the country, and urged the Malian authorities and France to report regularly to the UN security council on civilian casualties and human rights violations by all parties. Military action has disrupted the work of some NGOs in the north. Action Against Hunger said it has suspended its programmes in Gao temporarily, and warned that clashes are hampering humanitarian aid to vulnerable communities. &quot;This new phase of the conflict is adding to the fragility of the population,&quot; said Vincent Stehli, director of operations for Action Against Hunger. &quot;We fear the worst is yet to come in the spring  the period between harvests, when food reserves will be exhausted. For now, we have been forced to suspend our projects in Gao, as the hospital where we were treating malnourished children is closed.&quot;",

    "text": "I know what you&apos;re thinking ... after five updates already, how much more can they possibly squeeze out of the moneypit/sandbox that is The Sims 3? In fairness, though, this one does seem to have a few features that fans may soon find indispensable as well as a theme clearly designed to appeal to whole new audience. As such, Sims 3: Showtime is looking like the franchise&apos;s most extensive re-tweak in a long while and possibly the last before Sims 4. Showtime&apos;s theme reflects the current reality talent show zeitgeist; it&apos;s all about turning wanabes into divas, literally one stage at a time. In addition to your usual pursuits of socialising, cruising and accessorising your world, Showtime gives you three new careers  that of a Magician, Acrobat or Singer, with an additional DJ career for moonlighters. The three main paths start by performing for peanuts, usually in your own home for the amusement of friends, before earning enough experience to hit ever larger venues. Naturally, as you grow in expertise, you get bigger tips, your reputation (and personal relationships) improve and your act gets to incorporate bigger, more crowd pleasing features. Acrobats, for instance, begin as mime artists, mastering basic balance ball tricks and flips before moving onto fully customised stadium shows. Magicians get to invest in new props like the Box of Mystery or Swords of Destiny. Singers meanwhile unlock new props, costumes and tracks  something expanded on in the limited edition box that features licensed material from Katy Perry, no doubt the first in a string of celebrity endorsements.     The Sims 3 Showtime will bring a dose of X Factor to your gaming    Whatever your chosen talent, you soon outgrow the need to audition for gigs or take part in Sim Fests (where you just show up and try your luck against other players or NPCs.) There are eight levels of career progression, ending up with headline shows in bigger venues. Although these do look good  don&apos;t be expecting too much in the way of pyrotechnics  this is The Sims, after all, and the emphasis firmly remains on micromanagement. With a host of new props, fashions and features to enhance your act, you&apos;ll be tinkering away at these for weeks. And for the first time, you can accumulate enough Happiness points to unlock a Midlife Crisis, allowing you to fundamentally change your personality. However, although existing fans may appreciate these additions to the core game, it&apos;s new fans that the developers are really after  and these too are based around your improving performance abilities. Once your act is at a state to feel proud of, Showtime&apos;s other two key features kick in. First there&apos;s the Simport, which allows you to send your acts to another player&apos;s port; they get to see your performance, you get to keep the credits and experience points when they return. Simport is exclusive to this add-on but at the time of writing could not be play-tested, so it remains to be seen how useful this particular feature will be. Showtime&apos;s second feature, however, applies to all Sims 3 add-ons and is a fully integrated part of the UI. Social Networking was, according to developers, introduced due to strong community demand and it&apos;s very easy to use. It allows you to display badges, achievements and milestones, invite an audience to a particular venue or send and receive instant messages to specific friends or the whole Sims community  so if you&apos;re fussy about privacy, better customise those preferences early.     The Sims 3 Showtime    In fairness, though, this is unlikely to bother a community already well used to the wheeling, dealing and socialising that goes on in Sims 3  all of which is about to get a whole lot easier. Overall, Showtime features all the things you would expect. Although I did not get long enough to explore the new town of Starlight Shore, it seemed to have all the requisite landmarks and places of interest, obviously, with a heavy bias towards performance opportunities. There&apos;s also 250 new objects (including karaoke machines, jukeboxes and light systems) new traits, milestones, achievements and medals as well as the tantalising potential of killing a fellow Sim (but you&apos;ll have to be a magician to find out how). Combined with the new social networking and Simport features, and the potential for bigger celebrity and programme tie-ins in future and The Sims&apos; journey towards becoming a fully formed personality cult, now complete with delusions of grandeur, seems almost complete. If that idea floats your boat, then The Sims 3: Showtime could well tide you over till the next series of &apos;Britain&apos;s Got Talent&apos;.  The Sims 3: Showtime will be released for PC on 9 March",

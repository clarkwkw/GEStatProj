    "text": "Four months into the UK&apos;s coalition government, Nick Clegg gave a speech on &quot;governing for the long term&quot;. It wasn&apos;t a premature pitch for re-election; rather, the deputy prime minister wanted to highlight how a culture of short-termism pervades political life, and how &quot;the longer-term vision we are adopting in government will help to wipe the slate clean, and ensure that future generations can thrive.&quot; Clegg would struggle to make such a speech today. Difficult decisions such as those required on nuclear power, a third runway at Heathrow, House of Lords reform and Britain&apos;s place in Europe have been delayed, or are beset with uncertainty. The constraints of a fixed, five-year coalition agreement have been exacerbated by the erosion of Whitehall&apos;s capacity to think long term, through the scrapping of bodies like the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit, the Sustainable Development Commission and the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. Despite the chronic short-termism of our politics, exacerbated by the news cycle and the immediacy of social media, we need politicians and policymakers who are willing to look beyond the next election. Across a host of pressing social and environmental agendas, long-term perspectives are required. How can we extend our time horizons? Environmental enlightenment Part of the answer is through creative institutions. In 1970, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution was created as an independent body, to consider environmental policy issues facing the UK and the world. Over the course of four decades, RCEP is credited with having &quot;influenced the content, even the fundamental tenets, of policies affecting the environment, with a reach that often extended into the wider international arena&quot;. More than 30 RCEP reports were produced, on topics ranging from nuclear power and industrial pollution; to the environmental impact of housing; genetically modified organisms; and managing waste. Although it then fell victim to the &quot;bonfire of the quangos&quot; in the government&apos;s 2011 austerity drive, there is much to learn from the influence of RCEP over its long life.  RCEP was considered influential because it was authoritative, autonomous and trustworthy. Its independent status allowed it to consider issues of its own choosing, and importantly, it took a longer-term view, so was able to enter into politically sensitive debates. In some cases, RCEP&apos;s recommendations were immediately accepted. In others, the gradual process of acceptance took up to 20 years.  Beyond its formal reports, Susan Owens (a former RCEP member who has also analysed its work) argues that the commission&apos;s wider &quot;atmospheric influence&quot; was powerful in promoting fundamental principles such as precaution and transparency in environmental policy over many decades. It was a significant source of &quot;enlightenment&quot;; enabling knowledge and ideas to percolate gradually into policy over time through processes of diffusion that were only possible because of its longevity.  The politics of pensions The Pensions Commission, led by Lord Adair Turner from 2002 to 2006, is another example of a novel institution which brought expertise to a long-term issue. In a highly charged arena, it sought to depoliticise the pensions debate and build consensus by analysing the future trends likely to impact an under-resourced UK pension system. In 340 fact-packed pages, its first report debunked a number of assumptions and highlighted how increased life expectancy, low predicted birth rates and a two-fold increase in the population over 65 by 2050 would place significant strain on the pension system.  Its second report, released in 2006, concluded that Britons needed to work longer, save harder and pay more tax to achieve a more secure pensions system. Describing these as &quot;clear and unavoidable trade-offs&quot;, Lord Turner argued that an increase in the state pension age, in line with rising life expectancy, was essential to keep the system affordable and fair. Remarkably, given the sensitivity of this recommendation, the Pensions Commission eventually received cross-party support. By May 2006, Tony Blair, who was passionate about pension reform, had set out a two-stage legislative programme to reform the UK system.  Fast forward to 2013, and the recommendations of the commission are still influential. A recent House of Lords inquiry, led by Lord Filkin, acknowledges the progress in pension reform as a result of Lord Turner&apos;s work, but argues that government may now need to go further.  Foresight and horizon scanning The government&apos;s Foresight programme provides another useful template for longer-term analysis and horizon scanning. Established in 1994, Foresight is charged with &quot;helping government think systematically about the future&quot; and reports to the government&apos;s chief scientific adviser (GCSA) and to the Cabinet Office. From food, farming and floods to finance and future disasters, Foresight projects tackle diverse topics, and are well respected in the policy community. Each project typically runs for two years, guided by a high-level stakeholder group and chaired by a government minister.  Elsewhere, the capacity for deep analysis and systemic review of longer-term issues across government is patchy. A recent review, led by the Cabinet Office, acknowledged this and sought to improve horizon-scanning functions. But at a time of government austerity, longer-term perspectives can seem a distraction from the more pressing demands of the day. There is concern across Whitehall that  despite Nick Clegg&apos;s warm words  this government has eroded strategic capacity at its centre. In particular, the decision at the end of 2010 to close the Prime Minister&apos;s Strategy Unit sent a worrying signal about the place of longer-term analysis in the new government.  The Strategy Unit, established by Tony Blair in 2002, was the primary source of futures thinking at the centre of government throughout Labour&apos;s time in office, conducting reviews across education, healthcare, energy, social mobility and risk. The unit&apos;s former director, Stephen Aldridge describes how it could &quot;step back a bit from the events of the day, the immediate crises, and offer a more considered view to the prime minister and No 10&quot;. Nudging forward Downing Street argues that these functions have been absorbed elsewhere, within its now-enlarged Policy Unit. In its place, there has been a lot of interest in the Behavioural Insights Team or &quot;nudge unit&quot;, based in the Cabinet Office. By their nature, however, &quot;nudge&quot; interventions suggest modest, incremental change rather than longer-term, more visionary approaches to policy. The nudge model is arguably well-suited to the pragmatic realities of fixed-term coalition government. There is a danger, however, that the UK nudges forward at the expense of bolder action on challenges such as industrial policy, energy, infrastructure, climate change and ageing that all demand a longer-term view. Improving the evidence base and extending the time horizon of decision making should be twin priorities for every responsible government. But more thinking about how to do this is required. In September 2012, the Oxford Martin School established a Commission for Future Generations, chaired by Pascal Lamy, the director-general of the World Trade Organization. Frustrated by the gap between knowledge and action in relation to many of the most pressing policy challenges, the commission will consider how governments and global institutions can look beyond the pressures of short-term crisis management. The commission&apos;s report, expected in late 2013, will provide practical advice drawn from examples around the world.  Clegg spoke in 2010 of ensuring that future generations can thrive, without being burdened by the &quot;dead weight&quot; of earlier policy failures. Our fear is that without appropriate action on critical longer-term issues, the burden for future generations will prove unbearable.

    "headline": "Country diary archive, 24 April 1912: Mud lampreys flash their silvery underparts", 
    "text": "The little mud lampreys wriggled up against the stream, making headway near the bank but often falling back where the stream was strong. Sometimes they were rolled over and over, their silvery underparts flashing as they were carried over the sand, but those which could reach stone fixed themselves to it with their suctorial discs and defied the current. Where a tree had fallen and drift litter had collected in the submerged branches dozens of lampreys had gathered in the slack water of the obstruction; they writhed and wriggled in a squirming mass.  There was considerable bird movement between the 20th and 22nd, and it is not possible to acknowledge all the records which reached me yesterday and this morning. The corncrake was heard at Llanrwst yesterday, and cuckoos were in voice everywhere; I heard my first. The arrival of large numbers of tree pipits had great influence on the spring chorus, and many species, already mentioned in these notes, were noticed in fresh localities and in abundance where only single birds had been seen before.",

Microsoft answers the question of Xbox One region locks | Digital Trends  As the details of the Xbox One continue to trickle out following the May 21, 2013 unveiling and the subsequent deluge of facts (some real, some not), we have one more piece of information to confirm about the console: the Xbox One will still feature regional locks. &quot;Similar to the movie and music industry, games must meet country-specific regulatory guidelines before they are cleared for sale,&quot; A rep from Microsoft confirmed to Digital Trends. &quot;We will continue to work with our partners to follow these guidelines with Xbox One.&quot;  The Xbox One can talk to you, will feature remote play | Polygon Polygon reckons Microsoft will have two big new XBone things to show off at E3:  Among the features not yet shown off for the console is the ability for gamers to have a friend take over gameplay remotely to help them through a difficult spot in a game and Kinect&apos;s ability to talk back to gamers.  Of course, Sony has made remote play a key feature of the PS4 proposition, so it was always likely we&apos;d see something similar on Xbox. According to Polygon&apos;s source, it works in conjunction with Skype, so that while chatting friends can take over each other&apos;s games. It&apos;s the Siri-like talk function that Polygon&apos;s story focuses on though, highlighting this rather startling possibility:  In one possible scenario, Kinect used its facial recognition to scan a room full of people and note if there was someone in the room it didn&apos;t recognize. It then told the console owner that there is someone in the room it didn&apos;t recognize and asked the new person to identify themselves. Once the person said their name, Kinect welcomed them and saved their information to the console.  The big interview: Phil Harrison on Xbox One, Kinect, indie games and red rings | Eurogamer.net If you haven&apos;t yet read this key interview from the Xbox One event, have a look at it now. It includes this reassurance from Phil Harrison on the subject of Kinect&apos;s spying abilities:  &quot;We&apos;re a leader in the world of privacy, I think you&apos;ll find. We take it very seriously. We aren&apos;t using Kinect to snoop on anybody at all. We listen for the word &apos;Xbox on&apos; and then switch on the machine, but we don&apos;t transmit personal data in any way, shape or form that could be personally identifiable to you, unless you explicitly opt into that.&quot;  Nicholas Lovell&apos;s Blog - Xbox One: a flawed plan, well executed | Gamasutra And here&apos;s industry analyst Nicholas Lovell on the XBone proposition:  Tactically, Microsoft needs to get an installed base fast. To do that, you need a product that solves a need. The problem the Xbox One solves best is a gaming one: &quot;how can I play great games on my 42&quot; screen?&quot; The other problems it solves (&quot;how do I control my television with my voice?&quot;, &quot;how do I stream television content through the same box I play my games on?&quot;) are not problems that consumers know they have, so they are unlikely to rush out to spend several hundred dollars to solve them. The Xbox 360 was a games device first and foremost, yet more than half of the time spent on the console is now spent consuming other media. Score one for the Trojan Horse tactic. That&apos;s why it seems so odd that Microsoft have abandoned the tactic so well in the last generation.  &quot;Stay away from DRM&quot;  campaign targets Sony | VG247  Fearing Sony might implement similar policies concerning used games sales and DRM to those Microsoft is rumored to be using for the Xbox One, fans have kicked off a Twitter campaign to reach out to key PlayStation employees, urging them to steer clear of such policies for the PlayStation 4. The campaign which took off via a forum post over at NeoGaf has been started to ensure Sony gets to know gamers&apos; opinions regarding restrictive DRM and used game policies and how they don&apos;t want such restrictions to be placed upon them when it comes to gaming on Sony&apos;s next-gen console: the PlayStation 4.  The Weblog METEOR&apos;s 2013 Famicase Exhibition Dreams Up Fictitious 8-Bit Games | IndieGames.com  Each year Satoshi Sakagami, owner of the METEOR game culture shop, invites illustrators and designers to create cover art for fictitious Famicom game titles. This year&apos;s entries will be on display in Kichijouji, Tokyo until the end of the month and online at famicase.com. In addition, Adrien Dufond&apos;s Famicase Chronicle showcases all cartridges in the series since 2005 in an easy to navigate whirlpool shaped visualizer.  There are some absolutely beautiful works of virtual nostalgia in here. Kickstart This: TinyKeep | TIGSource TinyKeep is a roguelike action RPG, currently looking for Kickstarter funding. Here&apos;s why you should care:  To increase the challenge and create a world that feels alive, the game&apos;s sole programmer, Phi Dinh, has placed heavy focus on the project&apos;s AI system. Dungeon inhabitants and monsters each have needs and desires, and will move about independent of player interaction in an attempt to fulfill those goals  feeding, sleeping, and interacting with each other in interesting ways.  A really interesting way to add new dynamics to a familiar genre. DmC Devil May Cry developer reveals free-to-play mobile game Fightback | Videogamer  Ninja Theory has announced Fightback, an 80s-inspired free-to-play action game heading to iOS and Android this summer. Published by Chillingo, Fightback is said to include a &quot;revolutionary touch-based combat system&quot; and feature a &quot;striking 80s action movie vibe&quot;. It&apos;ll also be the developer&apos;s first mobile title.  Interesting side-project from one of my favourite UK developers. You can follow Press Start at Pinboard.",

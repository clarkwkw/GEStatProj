    "text": "If the purpose of every new release in a popular gaming franchise is to widen the IP&apos;s audience, what are we to make of Final Fantasy XIII-2? Here is a JRPG  never the most inviting of genres  that is also the sequel to a game whose story will take players the better part of 25 hours to get through. You have to ask, is it the best entry point into the Final Fantasy series for newcomers? Not only that, but will it attract series veterans  particularly those who decried its predecessor as, at best, an unnecessarily simplified iteration and, at worst, the moment the FF series jumped the proverbial shark Final Fantasy XIII may have sold a couple of million units but it was also loudly criticised by fans as being too linear in structure for the most part. Players were eventually allowed to explore its open-world of Pulse in the latter stages of the game, but first, they had to slog through 24 hours worth of battles and cut-scenes, during which their progression was confined to a series of admittedly beautiful corridors. It was a shock to series veterans, who complained that XIII lacked the mini-games, side-quests and other peripheral activities that made other FF entries so engaging. It&apos;s hard not to see a couple of Final Fantasy XIII-2&apos;s features as an answer to these criticisms. The linearity of XIII has been replaced with a set of levels housed by an open-ended structure that offers players a far greater degree of freedom in how they approach things. Furthermore, the breaks XIII put on how players chose to level up their characters is now a thing of the past; players can now level up the game&apos;s protagonists and their allies however they see fit. The game also contains quite a few NPCs offering side-quests, items for sale and mini-games. There&apos;s even a casino-style level where players can kick back and earn credits betting on slots or Chocobo races. Final Fantasy XIII-2 feels like a more traditional JRPG than its predecessor in terms of its size and structure, and FF fans that felt XIII was at odds with the spirit of the series will find much to attract them here. The only major barrier standing in the way of prospective players is the game&apos;s convoluted plot, which to some degree, demands that they know what transpired in Final Fantasy XIII. There&apos;s an attempt to bring newcomers up to speed in the form of a Beginner&apos;s Primer in the game&apos;s start menu, but really, they&apos;re likely to remain in the dark as the opening cinematic commences.     Final Fantasy XIII-2    FF XIII-2 kicks off with an on-rails battle between Lightning (one of XIII&apos;s main protagonist) and Caius (a brand new villain wielding a ridiculously oversized sword) over the city of Valhalla. As their battle demolishes the metropolis around them, Lighting and Caius are interrupted by the arrival of Noel Kreiss, a traveller from 700 years in the future, where mankind is all but extinct. In short order, Lightning sends Noel back through time with a Moogle  a cuddly-looking imp who transforms into a bow  to find her sister, Serah. Once Noel and Serah (and the Moogle) join forces, they explore different ages of Pulse and Cocoon across the space/time continuum in search of Lightning. Along the way, the pair learns that someone or something has altered space and time, and that Noel&apos;s bleak future isn&apos;t necessarily how the fate of mankind should play out. While this may all sound intriguing, the story is arguably one of FF XIII-2&apos;s weakest elements. As Noel and Serah travel from age to age, the plot&apos;s narrative arch seems to recede further and further into the background. It also doesn&apos;t help much that the dialogue in the game is frequently quite bad and the protagonists become harder and harder to care about. There are a handful of moments in the game&apos;s plot that initially sound promising, but this potential is left largely unfulfilled. That said, it&apos;s a testament to how many other strong aspects Final Fantasy XIII-2 boasts that players who enjoy this series or genre of game should still take a punt on it.     Final Fantasy XIII-2    The game&apos;s less rigid structure is the first notable improvement; Serah and Noel can move forward and backward in time visiting various ages through the use of time gates called the Historia Crux. These gates are unlocked with Artefacts the pair collect throughout their adventures and their time-travelling power can be accessed at any time (along with the game&apos;s save feature) by hitting the start button. This means players can jump through time and space whenever they choose, although they&apos;ll enter any world they re-visit at the precise point they left it. The Historia Crux goes a long way towards making FF XIII-2 feel more open-ended than its predecessor. Furthermore, the worlds it allows the players to visit contain a wealth of content in the form of NPCs, side-quests, shops and story missions. Not only that, their design is always vibrant and imaginative  and in some instances, jaw-droppingly beautiful. Each new level  whether it&apos;s a world in permanent eclipse, a futuristic, rain-swept, neon-encrusted metropolis, or an open plane where the inhabitants use a machine to change the weather  is a unique and inviting vision. The protagonists and monsters look visually stunning and their in-game models are meticulously detailed. There&apos;s an odd instance where an NPC or creature looks badly rendered, but these are exceptions rather than the rule. The game&apos;s ATB (Active-Time-Battle) combat system has been slightly tweaked for the better. Unlike XIII, paradigm shifts don&apos;t cause a break in the action, battles don&apos;t end if the team leader dies and players can switch leaders mid-battle.     Final Fantasy XIII-2    In boss battles, players are called upon to complete Cinematic Actions. These are essentially ramped up Quick Time Events, which only serve to make the battles look and feel quite cool. Players can also recruit defeated monsters into their battle posses, and level them up with components they come across. Monsters have set roles in combat, but players can stack three creatures in their paradigm decks and have the option of switching them out on the fly in battle. Final Fantasy XIII 2 is by no means perfect; while the ATB system looks and feels easy to begin with, players will encounter difficulty spikes later on that will seem unfair. Specialising in the early stages helps, as does kitting out the protagonists with decent accessories and weapons  and the game doesn&apos;t signpost this very much. Instead, players will find themselves required to do quite a bit of reading in the game&apos;s exhaustive menus. But then, JRPG purists and FF fans will point out that this sort of thing is part and parcel with the territory. Final Fantasy XIII-2 isn&apos;t straight-forward by any stretch of the imagination. It&apos;s a piece of entertainment that demands the player gives themselves to it completely before it offers any sort of reward. Players who are attracted to this sort of game know who they are and in all likelihood have already pre-ordered a copy. Series veterans will be pleased to learn that FF XIII-2 is a definite improvement on its predecessor. If you&apos;re a newcomer, answer this question as honestly as possible; are you likely to be put off a game by the idea that one of the protagonist&apos;s most powerful weapons transforms into an adorably cute imp that says &quot;Kupo!&quot; at the end of every second sentence? If the answer is no, then FF XIII-2 is well worth exploring. If the answer is yes, then move on  there&apos;s nothing for you here.  Game reviewed on Xbox 360",

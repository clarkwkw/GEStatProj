    "text": "Before play even begins, offbeat action platformer Sumioni makes an impact based on its striking art style alone. Inspired by Japanese sumi-e, or ink wash, the game presents a world of unique visuals steeped in rich mythology. It&apos;s not the first game to adopt the technique  Okami and the lesser known Odin Sphere both employed sumi-e to various extents  but it&apos;s used to particularly grand effect here. Although the plot is a generic quest for vengeance to unseat a despotic powermonger, where Sumioni shines is in making especially good use of the Vita&apos;s touchscreen functions. Guiding the ink demon Agura through 2D levels and slicing down enemies can be done with the physical buttons, but feels clunky. The core mechanic is, instead, to draw on the screen to modify the surroundings, use magic or summon powerful beasts. Once into the flow, swishing bridges over obstacles or setting fortresses on fire while dodging attacks becomes instinctive. A cadence to battle develops, jumping and painting almost in time with the music  it&apos;s all rather zen, appropriately so. Stages are sometimes too short, though, and the challenge between them varies wildly. Throughout, Sumioni&apos;s greatest strength remains its good looks, but it&apos;s so good-looking, that&apos;s almost enough.",

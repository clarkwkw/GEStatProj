    "text": "Sega&apos;s second attempt at the kart racer, the follow-up to 2010&apos;s Sonic &amp; Sega All-Star Racing, proves to be a sharp, intelligent sequel that adds air- and water-based racing to the mix, with impressive results. Sumo Digital&apos;s development team features alumni from such high-end racers as Blur and Split/Second, so it&apos;s no surprise to find a fun, responsive driving model at the core of the game. The standard kart-racing formula  non-stop acceleration, improbable drifting and cartoon weaponry  is so well executed that it&apos;s almost disappointing when the road runs out and the boats and aircraft come into play. But Sumo has cleverly ensured that these new air and water sections offer their own unique challenges. In the skies, obstacles can be avoided with barrel-rolls and flips (earning a boost in the process) while the turbulent waters generate large waves and whirlpools to throw the racers off course. Seamless transitions between vehicles mean the action never slows and there&apos;s real joy in linking drifts, stunts, pickups and near-collisions to achieve colossal speed boosts. With a variety of split-screen party games and online modes included, Sonic &amp; All Stars Racing Transformed is a wonderfully complete package that really deserves attention amid the month&apos;s triple-A releases.",

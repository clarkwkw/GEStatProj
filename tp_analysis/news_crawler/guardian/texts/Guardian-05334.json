    "text": "to Britain&apos;s economy has not recovered as fast as the government expected. Growth is anaemic, and unemployment is rising. The recession has one beneficial effect: the cost of government borrowing has fallen. Give or take, the government can now borrow at exactly the rate of inflation for almost any duration. When it calculated the losses on the student loan book the government assumed that it would have to pay 2.2% above inflation to borrow money. That was a reasonable assumption then, but it is not a reasonable assumption now. When interest rates are 2.2% above inflation, the government loses approximately 25p for every pound loaned to students. When interest rates equal inflation, the government is predicted to make a small profit on the student loan book, even taking into account the fall in graduate incomes caused by the recession. Enough students will pay the 0-3% interest rate supplement to cover the losses from those students who do not pay off their loan in full. It is therefore apparently costless to expand university places this year. Naysayers will point out that expanding higher education brings other costs. Some students, for example, are eligible for maintenance grants, averaging perhaps 1,500. This is approximately twice the estimated profit that the government will make on the student loan book. The government could however require universities to offer additional places to cover this cost. Economies of scale in the university sector mean that many universities may be happy to expand even if they have to remit a few hundred pounds to the government for each additional student. The government needs to be clear about whether additional students are likely to have the same income trajectories as the average student on which these figures are based. Additional students may not have as successful careers. Again, however, the government can still ensure that the expansion is costless by placing a cap on the level of student fees for the additional places. This will then serve as a cap on the additional loans. Lots of people will claim that falling government interest rates mean that their pet project is now viable: the &quot;spend to save&quot; mantra is much overused. What makes this scheme different is that the government gains an asset that delivers a financial return on a contractual basis. The government&apos;s return is not contingent on the investment raising the rate of economic growth. Instead, it is guaranteed to get 9% of a student&apos;s income over the 21,000 threshold, even if that student does not earn any more money as a result of going to university. Investment in university places is radically different to investment in infrastructure or schools. This is understood by statisticians, who increased the deficit only by the predicted loss on students, rather than by the full extent of the loan. This proposal makes sense in government accounting terms, as well as in economic terms. The government should therefore expand higher education now. It should do so by making the places open to competition so that students not politicians choose which universities get to expand. This would cut youth unemployment immediately, and raise growth in the medium term. It is free to the government in both accounting terms, and in underlying economic terms. No other policy offers these advantages and the government must seize it immediately.

    "text": "This is the second generation cee&apos;d. They&apos;ve made it longer, lower and narrower. More aerodynamic, with resulting improvements in fuel efficiency and C02 emissions. It&apos;s also stiffer, which  for anyone who isn&apos;t an expert in automotive engineering  is a good thing (no one wants to drive a flaccid car, do they?). Better all round, then. There is one thing they&apos;ve blatantly failed to address, though. I&apos;m talking about the apostrophe, of course. The lower-case c, well, that&apos;s just childish and irritating. The apostrophe is a catastrophe, a punctuation abomination. Apostrophes are used to signify possession, or to mark missing letters. The d following this one would suggest the latter  &apos;d means either had or would. So, given agood subediting, this is either aKia Cee Had or a Kia Cee Would, right? Had or would what, though? Has it reversed itself into the past perfect tense? Is there some kind ofcondition attached? Come to think about it, how do you refer to this car in the conditional mood, conversationally, with contractions? A Kia cee&apos;d&apos;d be an excellent car if it didn&apos;t have such a stupid name  like that, with a double apostrophe? Huh, they didn&apos;t think of that, did they? Idiots. It is an excellent car. If not aspecially lovable one. Kia says it no longer makes cars that just appeal to the logical rather than the emotional side of the brain. That may be true of the Soul or the Sportage, both of which have a certain Tonka toy charm. Not so the cee&apos;d. Even in its new, slinkier form, it still looks like awhole bunch of other cars. No one&apos;s going to get one because they&apos;ve always dreamed of having a cee&apos;d. Or because they see it and they think: yes, I love it, that&apos;s the car for me. Or because of the thrilling driving experience. They&apos;re going to get one because it&apos;s good value for money, with an impressive amount of kit, plenty of space, too, in the back and in the boot, and an amazing seven-year warranty. It makes sense. We went to Norfolk  sensibly, logically, unexcitingly (no one&apos;s going to be calling it a lightning cee&apos;d, as a little pun). With everything required for a weekend in Norfolk, and space to spare. And we may have looked a little enviously at the Golfs, but then laughed when we remembered they&apos;d paid more than we did. Or would&apos;ve done, if the cee&apos;d&apos;d really been ours. Plus, they probably didn&apos;t even have cruise control. Where in Norfolk? Not far from King&apos;s Lynn, as it happens. With anapostrophe. Because it&apos;s a lynn, and it probably once belonged to aking. OK?

    "headline": "Bob Geldof: Gleneagles G8 summit was a triumph for Africa  and Tony Blair", 
    "text": "Of all the G8 summits, Gleneagles in 2005 has been the most significant. It achieved so much, the breadth of its success is extraordinary and still reverberating in astonishing ways that shape not only our politics but that of the world. It was also perhaps the first and last time the leaders of what were still then the richest and most powerful nations acknowledged the flaws of &quot;globalisation one&quot; and its negative effects on the poor of Africa. It was the first to recognise that a new world had dawned and a new world order needed to be accommodated. Indeed it was for the continent what Kofi Annan called &quot;the Rubicon-crossing moment&quot;. What Tony Blair realised through the findings of his Commission for Africa was that those things that had been lobbied for so intensely, for so long, by the NGO activists were critically necessary, not just in a humanitarian sense but in a profoundly political way also. Cancelling debt and doubling aid (the trade part was never going to be discussed at Gleneagles as the WTO round was happening two weeks later and the leaders only wanted to deal with the issue in that forum, which of course failed) would release tens of millions of children into schooling, setting off an intellectual stampede in the continent with the fastest growing middle-class in the world, the fastest urbanising, the youngest continent with teenagers being the average age, the fastest growing telecoms industry and the brainpower to fuel seven of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world. It also of course crucially helped prevent the unnecessary deaths of millions of children through easily preventable diseases amongst other things. It seems odd now that editorials and columns were stuffed with finger-wagging bromides on &quot;moral hazard&quot;. We don&apos;t hear much of that these days as we all do the Debt Forgiveness Rag in our part of the world. The aid, though never completely fulfilled, also sent money into basic health, education and agriculture, providing stability at a fundamental community level and allowing stretched societies a moment to pause and take a breath while helping governments acquire the capacity they needed to govern. This was especially critical as just at that point Chinese investment in commodities and infrastructure became massive and billions of dollars rolled through the continent: all of this at the moment of digital takeoff. Connectivity was the glue that made it all coherent. People, even though they had no roads or rail or air now, had virtual digital infrastructure. They could begin to talk and trade. They could join the global economic loop on their own terms. They could and did talk to us as equals and not through some artificial filter or third-party interpretation. They began to breathe, to live, some to thrive and to grow. Gleneagles was half of that stimulus package. This steady commitment has been matched through the Brown government and, to its great credit, the Cameron one. It is an example of coherent, predictive, thought-through government policy, its success all achieved with the extraordinary consistent support of the British electorate who on survey after survey see no problem in the the development budget increasing by one third of a penny in the pound. And they are right. Of course the motivation was to stop innocents from needless suffering, to give people a better chance but the payback has been immense not just for the people and government of Britain but also for the economy. British investment into Africa is 50 times that of Germany and four times that of the US. We are the acknowledged political leaders in the area of development which gives us not just vast soft power, influence and leadership on a global stage on the issues but also makes us leaders in economic investment in the rising giant. If you had put $1 into a British Unilever investment on the London or New York stock exchange last year it would have returned you something around $8. If you had put that same $1 into an African Unilever affiliate on a local exchange you would have returned north of $27. To see this, indeed to have been in Gleneagles, to have been part of it, to have helped with Live8 and MPH is extraordinary for me. I have no doubt that it is because of Gleneagles that I and colleagues were able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in Africa and create jobs. Who&apos;d have thought? The people you kept alive all those 30 years ago are now being invested in to create the skills, trades and jobs that go with growth. And their children will hopefully never have to go through the disgrace and agony of that terrifying period in the mid-80s. But it is a vast continent and there is still vast poverty and still millions that need some of our assistance. But surely now the model has been proved. Surely now there are no more specious arguments over the economic, humanitarian, political aims of Aid, Trade, Debt, Investment, Health, Growth. And as it grows Africans themselves will gradually put in place the economies and systems that will allow each of the 54 countries to deal with their own social and humanitarian issues, as some are already doing. This will happen and is happening. Africa is, according to the economic analysts, the coming economic giant. This following on from and accelerating previous British policy was made solid, coherent and structural at Gleneagles. Whatever one thinks of Tony Blair, it is unfair not to credit him with this immense political and diplomatic success. I was there and I must tell you it was not easy. They didn&apos;t want to do it. But he got it done. Gleneagles was many things amongst the murderous bombs, the triumph of the Olympic bid and the thunderous roar of Live8 but aside from the global leaders waking up to the new reality of Africa, China, the modern age of communication and its implication, it is Tony Blair&apos;s great lasting legacy  one of which he should be immensely proud. As should Britain.",

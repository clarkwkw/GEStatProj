    "text": "A prestigious music prize has been renamed after a string of women claimed the teacher it honoured had sexually abused them as teenagers. The Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM) in Manchester awards the Ryszard Bakst memorial prize for the best Chopin playing. But after the Guardian revealed that five women had come forward to accuse Bakst of molesting them before his death in 1999, the college has decided to rename the prize. When the annual award is presented on Wednesday 27 March, it will be called the RNCM prize for Chopin, said a college spokeswoman, a decision prompted by &quot;recent comments in the media&quot;. One of Bakst&apos;s victims, a Polish woman taught by him in Warsaw and Manchester, said it was &quot;the least the college could do&quot;. The former pupil, Woman Q, said he groped her during lessons for many years. &quot;Chopin was so close to Bakst&apos;s heart. He was such a great patriot, coming from the country of Chopin&apos;s birth, that after his death his body was taken to be buried in Poland. It is therefore very sad that this is happening,&quot; she said. &quot;However, now that all this came out it is probably better, since he is dead and cannot be punished, for the name change to act as a token to honour the feelings of all the women after what he has done. It&apos;s the least that the college could do given that he cannot be brought to justice, to respect those women who still have to live with those unpleasant memories.&quot; Other women told the Guardian Bakst would feel their breasts and put his hand up their skirts or force them to touch his erection. Some were aged under 16 at the time. Bakst taught at Chetham&apos;s and the RNCM for almost 30 years after being expelled from his native Poland in 1968 when the Polish authorities carried out their notorious Jewish purge.",

    "text": "Legendary games designer Warren Spector, creator of Deus Ex and Disney&apos;s Epic Mickey title, is in London next week  do you fancy meeting him? Well here&apos;s your chance, because the Guardian and Disney Interactive are running an exclusive Epic Mickey 2 event next Tuesday, 21 August, at the Disney headquarters in London.     Warren Spector Photograph: unknown    Spector will demo the game for a select group of Gamesblog readers, then he and I will discuss the game, his influences and his approach to design. We&apos;ll then invite audience questions before providing hands-on time with the game. Epic Mickey 2 is the sequel to Spector&apos;s inventive platform adventure, which throws our favourite cartoon mouse into a wasteland of abandoned Disney animations and theme park attractions. In the sequel, he returns to the troubled &apos;toon world once again, this time with a co-op partner, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, the first Disney star. This will be a unique opportunity to meet one of the great games designers, and to try out his latest game. The event kicks off at 5.30pm at the Disney offices in Hammersmith, and it&apos;s free to attend  but we only have room for 85 people in the screening room, so get in quick. If you want to come along, email Rebecca Wharmby at Disney  and we hope to see you there.",

    "text": "Nicola Dandridge, chief executive, Universities UK 2012 will be the year in which we will start to see the impact of the government&apos;s reforms to teaching funding It is likely that by September 2012 we will see an overall dip in student applications, though probably far less cataclysmic than many were initially predicting and more like the dip in 2006 when tuition fees tripled to 3,000 which then rectified in subsequent years.  The main concern is whether the dip will disproportionately be made up of students from poorer backgrounds: whose families are more likely to be debt-averse and with less of a tradition of going to university. 2012 will show whether those concerns about the new funding system are justified. Government policy has encouraged new higher education providers  for-profit providers from the UK and abroad, and further education colleges. In 2012 we will start to see the appetite amongst students to study with a range of new providers, as well as how the government intends to regulate for a level playing field in terms of financial and quality controls. UK universities are well-placed to expand their international activities in 2012. The forthcoming Brazilian student exchange programme will provide hundreds of under-graduate and post-graduate scholarships for Brazilian students to study in UK universities. This initiative is a measure of our strength and our international reputation. However, events such as the recent appalling murder of Indian student Anuj Bidve in Salford, as well as the potentially protectionist policies of our UK Border Agency, will present some very real threats in 2012 to what is an increasingly competitive global industry. 2012 will also see universities play a major part in the Olympics. Throughout the UK, universities will be hosting Olympic teams, will have conducted much of the research that underpins the performance of athletes, and will have graduated or trained mainly of them. In May, Universities UK will be using the theme of the Olympics in our Universities Week 2012 to demonstrate the extent to which UK universities have contributed in so many different ways, culturally, economically and socially, to the Olympics and their legacy. Conor Ryan, former government advisor, writer and consultant on education 2012 will be the year when the government&apos;s HE changes are properly tested I think ministers will struggle to resolve the central tension in the government&apos;s approach to higher education: how to develop a market while paying the up front costs of higher loans. The redistribution of 20,000 places for those charging lower fees seems unlikely to do it, and FE colleges are finding it harder to gain university accreditation for their degree courses. Legislation due in the spring could see measures to try to force more of a market and a wider range of lower cost degree courses. The Open University will find itself accrediting many more courses than it does now. If student numbers for 2012 are significantly down on 2011 figures, (as we now know they have) there will be growing Lib Dem and Labour pressure for stronger access regulation that will be resisted by universities. At the same time, the reality of the fees will see renewed pressure to increase contact time with students. Parents and students will demand more teaching and tutorial time to justify the fees they are paying, and this will become a big issue in the autumn. The UK will struggle in the international market, as Australian, other European and South East Asian competitor universities successfully highlight the &apos;hostility&apos; of the UK government towards overseas students, and offer attractive packages including English booster courses, simpler visa facilities and postgraduate work experience. Ministers will be forced to rethink this aspect of their migration policy as they see the economic impact. Sir Rodney Brooke, chair, QAA board of directors Students will be grateful to be in university and they will be expecting value for money While the move of power from the supply side to the demand side will have predictable consequences, a cast iron prediction for 2012 is that the present raft of changes in higher education will certainly have unintended consequences. The new exposure to fees will change student attitudes to higher education: they will expect value for money. They will seek greater engagement in the experience offered to them. Reciprocally, undergraduate teaching will overtake research and league tables in the priority rankings of many vice-chancellors, as their institutions compete for students. Students will begin to demand clear and accurate information about what they can expect from their higher education experience. Ratings on quality and standards will be an important part of the information they seek when choosing an academic destination. In addition, the government&apos;s requirement for risk-based regulation will increase the focus on quality and standards in higher education. The decision that an institution is &apos;risky&apos; is, in itself, a judgement and as such, QAA&apos;s exposure to controversy will increase from its role in risk assessment its new responsibility for the educational oversight of private colleges, where &apos;highly trusted&apos; status could be withdrawn by the UK Border Agency without a positive review. In the seismic change faced by the sector, it is important that the student experience is enhanced and that the brand of UK higher education does not suffer. There is reason to believe that both will be enhanced by the changes. Michael Farthing, University of Sussex VC and chair of the 1994 Group Hopes for clarity over reforms and more uncapped places It is difficult to predict what the year will hold but I can tell you what I hope. My sincere hope is that 2012 will be the year the government addresses some of the major uncertainties all of us in higher education are wrestling with. First, I hope we&apos;ll see signs of a long term plan to give all talented students greater choice by expanding uncapped places beyond the current AAB+ proposals. Allowing all universities to compete for all students would create more opportunities for people to study at the universities best suited to develop their talents and potential. Next, it has to be the year that the government wakes up to the importance of postgraduate study, and the risks being created by the lack of financial support for postgraduate students. Businesses are crying out for more and more employees with postgraduate level skills, just as the future success of the university research base rests on a pipeline of students progressing to doctoral programmes. We need to see some innovative thinking on how to incentivise and support postgraduates, particularly in light of the changes to undergraduate funding. Finally, I hope that 2012 will see a major push on UK universities realising their global ambitions. Our excellent institutions are becoming ever more international in their outlook, and its good news that the government has recognised this with the launch of &apos;HE Global&apos; and a new collaborative vehicle. More needs to be done though, particularly to ensure that international students and faculty are not deterred from coming to UK institutions. These are some of the major issues troubling the sector as 2011 draws to a close. It&apos;s vital that 2012 heralds some much needed long term clarity. Dr Wendy Piatt, director general, the Russell Group 2012 will see the appointment of a new director at the Office For Fair Access and the rest of arbitrary, artificial targets The new year will open with the government&apos;s grant letter to HEFCE for 2012-13. We hope that this won&apos;t deliver any unwelcome shocks. What is essential is that the remaining teaching grant available to HEFCE is targeted at high-cost and strategically important subjects such as medicine, engineering, chemistry and physics which are vital to the future success of the UK&apos;s economy and cannot be sustained on tuition fee income alone. 2012 will see the appointment of new director for fair access and an increase in the size and scope of the Office For Fair Access (OFFA). We take access to our universities incredibly seriously, but OFFA must resist an emphasis on artificial targets which can distract attention, effort and resources from the many successful access schemes already in place. We hope that OFFA fully recognises the challenges of setting and achieving really quite specific targets for access when universities do not have the power to solve the root causes of the problem of the under-representation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, which are underachievement at school and poor advice on the best choices of A-level subjects and university degree courses. Cuts to capital spend for universities indicated in latest spending review will create serious difficulties for UK universities despite the additional research council capital investment announced in the Chancellor&apos;s Autumn Statement. We must not forget that the world-class research and teaching infrastructure in universities is also essential to future economic growth. We might expect an early announcement on migrant settlement in the UK. The present proposals on settlement must be modified to ensure that our universities can continue to attract international academics to this country in the confidence that the immigration system will allow them to continue their research so long as it continues to benefit the UK&apos;s economy and wider society. Finally we must never forget that other nations are pumping billions of dollars into their leading universities and are already snapping at our heels. In 2012 we must not jeopardise the competitive advantage which has made our universities the envy of the world and the engine of growth for the UK. Pam Tatlow, chief executive, university think-tank Million+ 2012 will be the litmus test of the government&apos;s commitment to social mobility Students will still be ambitious for themselves and for their futures and will apply and enrol in greater numbers for university than some expected. However, many HE pundits will monitor enrolments with a close eye to see if any particular groups have been deterred. This will be the litmus test of the government&apos;s commitment to social mobility. The HE Bill will play second fiddle to Lords reform  but the Lords will be unimpressed by any attempt to allow non-teaching organisations to become universities in the future. Amid all of this, the challenges arising from instability in the global economy will continue to be played out. Even the sceptics will come to recognise that the role of all universities in promoting economic growth, innovation and social cohesion will be one of the key components of the recovery. In light of the above, I have a few wishes for 2012: that ministers dismiss the siren voices calling for the abolition of the widening participation premium but also realise that to intervene further in the student numbers market without knowing the outcomes of 2012 enrolments would be more akin to playing roulette with every chance of producing losers in terms of student and subject choice. And of course it would be marvellous if the Home Office recognised that international higher education partnerships and international students were one of the key assets of the UK&apos;s excellent world-class universities system. That would be one New Year&apos;s wish really worth having. Libby Hackett, director, University Alliance The rapid acceleration of new technology will have a bigger impact on HE than economic crisis Despite turbulent economic times in 2012, there is a bigger global picture that will have a greater impact on the future of higher education: the rapid acceleration of new technology, innovation, design and new knowledge. The same thing could have (and has) been said for many years now but it is the accelerated pace of change that will define the future of our universities - much more so than immediate economic conditions or successive government changes to university funding. Yes, 2012 will see the beginning of a new era of increased contributions from graduates (although none of this will be paid up-front by students in 2012 of course) and universities, as businesses, will feel the impact of a difficult economic climate. However, what drives a freight train through this short-term turbulence is a long-term trajectory of the increasing economic impact of our universities and graduates. Universities are no longer just about generating new knowledge within a protected academic environment. The ivory towers have fallen. All of our universities are working closely with new industries, design and technologies to make new discoveries that will change lives and tackle global challenges; playing a central role in both our economy and society. My prediction for 2012 is that the new student finance arrangements will begin with much less disruption than expected and that the UK higher education sector will continue to adapt, challenge and drive change in a way that benefits our society and economy. I also think that our sector, robust and with a long history of evolution, not revolution, will continue to demonstrate excellence in the traditions that it preserves as well as the barriers it breaks down in driving progress.

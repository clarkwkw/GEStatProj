    "text": "We condemn the eviction of students occupying Sussex University in opposition to privatisation plans, including the use of up to 100 police, some in full riot gear, accompanied by vans, bailiffs and private security guards to remove protesters from their own campus (Report, 3 April). The eight-week occupation has been a source of inspiration for students and staff at Sussex and beyond at a time when education is under attack. Instead of engaging with the arguments and alternatives being raised, the university management has resorted to the draconian measure of a ban on all protest without prior consent of university management. The police have arrested and charged four students. They are also investigating one student for violent disorder. This charge, which carries a maximum sentence of five years, is the charge used to secure prison sentences against students who opposed the tripling of fees in autumn 2010, including former Sussex student Zenon Mitchell, who was sentenced to 15 months in prison for protesting at Millbank. We will not stand by and watch a repeat of such punishments against students who have had the courage to take a stand in support of education and the welfare of university staff. As Sussex University staff have stated: &quot;The management&apos;s protestation that it will tolerate peaceful protest is an insult to the students and workers whose right to assemble and demonstrate as they see fit has been suppressed. A right is not a right if it waits on the decision of another. Without students, lecturers and support staff, there is no university. We hope that today is the beginning of a sustained campaign by students and workers to undermine and repeal this authoritarian measure.&quot; We call on the university management to rescind the injunction immediately and for any criminal charges against student protesters to be dropped.

    "text": "We&apos;re delighted that the badgers have had a reprieve. That goes without saying. Waking up this morning and realising they will live, rather than die, is great news for us. It&apos;s by no means the end of the line. What we need is a complete abandonment of this plan to cull badgers, which has always been irrelevant. There was never any chance culling badgers would solve the problem of bovine tuberculosis (TB). You could kill every badger in Britain and still have bovine TB in cows, and farmers would be in misery. I promised a long time ago to help farmers fight bovine TB. I stand by that, and have never forgotten it. I&apos;ve already been to Europe, to try to open the doors to vaccinating our cattle. The news I got was more hopeful than we&apos;ve been led to believe. I strongly believe Europe will not stand in our way, once we prove that our vaccine for cows works and once the Diva [Differentiate between Infected and Vaccinated Animals] test  which allows us to tell between infected and non-infected animals  has been licenced. In recent months it has been said that vaccination for cows is years away. I firmly believe that is no longer the case. The vaccine is not yet approved, the Diva test is not yet licensed. But a pilot vaccination scheme could come in months, not years. This is most exciting news that farmers could possibly have. All of Team Badger [a coalition of groups opposed to the badger cull] are committed not only to the welfare of badgers, but of cows, and are very conscious of the misery that bovine TB causes farmers. So with this policy of culling out of the way, it will clear us to working directly with the National Farmers&apos; Union. That&apos;s what I sincerely hope. I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who&apos;s contributed to raising public awareness of this issue. It&apos;s vital to everyone in this country, not just to the rural community. There is a much bigger picture here, which is the whole relationship humans have with other creatures on this planet. I would like to thank the public for rallying around so magnificently, showing that they would not stand for this ill-conceived killing of wild animals. I firmly believe that in a year&apos;s time, plans for vaccination of cows will be so advanced, that it will be clearly nonsense to consider going back to this policy of culling, which has no firm basis in science whatsoever. And it was in danger of alienating the farming community from the public. I have firm hopes we will move from postponement to cancellation, and a wholehearted commitment from government to a policy of vaccination. No recriminations, let&apos;s just move forward.  As told to Adam Vaughan",

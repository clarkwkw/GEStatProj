    "text": "With nations meeting in Doha to discuss a global plan to tackle climate change, the terrible floods hitting the UK are a stark warning about the need for urgent action to cut emissions (Labour accuses ministers of flood defence cuts, 27 November). Scientists predict the UK will experience severe flooding more frequently as climate change takes hold. The floods have severely disrupted people&apos;s lives and will cost the economy millions of pounds  highlighting the foolishness of the chancellor&apos;s insistence in only talking about the costs of tackling climate change. The UK government must stop dragging its feet on decarbonising our economy and show global leadership.Craig BennettCampaigns director, Friends of the Earth  Would all potential flood victims and actual victims (800 homes hit as rain and high winds cause havoc across the west and north, 26 November) feel more secure if some of the 100bn to be spent on upgrading Trident was instead used to massively upgrade flood defences?

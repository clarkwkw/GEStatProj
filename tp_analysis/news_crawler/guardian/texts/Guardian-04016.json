[I will identify this bird in 49 or so hours]  Image: David lvarez, 1 May 2010 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Canon EOS 50D 1/320 sec, f/5.6, 300 mm, iso200   I am so excited to introduce a new mystery bird photographer, David lvarez, an ecologist based at the Universidad de Oviedo. Dr lvarez studies phenotypic plasticity and phenotype-environment interactions as he teases apart different hypotheses about the process of local adaptation, a topic that I think is fascinating. He has very kindly allowed me to share his stunning images as mystery birds and I am hoping that he will chat with us in the future about his research.  Question: This Spanish mystery bird has a very peculiar reproductive behaviour. What behaviour is that? Why does this species engage in that behaviour? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? The Game: 1. This is intended to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 49 hours after publication.  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by providing the bird&apos;s common or scientific names in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird&apos;s identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints that may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints, such as puns and anagrams, may read like &quot;inside jokes&quot; and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

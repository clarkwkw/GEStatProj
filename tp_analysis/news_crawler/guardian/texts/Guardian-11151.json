    "text": "North Korea&apos;s launch of a satellite at 00:49 GMT on Wednesday came hours after the launch by the US of its secret OTV-3 space-plane. The latter is an unmanned mini-shuttle which is able to manoeuvre in orbit and which may carry advanced spying equipment. This same craft, one of two in operation, last flew in 2010 and is expected to spend months in orbit before flying down to a runway landing. Curiously, in acknowledging the Korean launch shortly after it occurred, the North American Aerospace Defence Command issued the reassuring statement that &quot;at no time was the missile or the resultant debris a threat to North America&quot;. In fact, I calculate that the satellite and two associated objects, perhaps the rocket&apos;s final (third) stage and a nose cone, passed almost directly northwards over Miami, Florida, only 74 minutes after the launch. By then, though, all were safely in orbit where I expect them to survive for a month or more. Of more concern to satellite operators, perhaps, is the aftermath of the explosion on 16 October of a Russian Briz-M rocket that failed during the August launch of two telecommunications satellites. The US military has catalogued 110 chunks of debris to date and there may be hundreds more. Most of them are moving in eccentric, changing, and difficult-to-track orbits between 250km and 5,000km in height and will probably re-enter within a year or two. Until they do, they pose a real danger of collision with the ISS and many other satellites.",

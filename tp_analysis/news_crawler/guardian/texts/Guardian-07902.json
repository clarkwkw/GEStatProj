    "text": "Rock band Green Day is starring in a new episode of the Angry Birds Friends game on Facebook: the latest big-name partnership for developer Rovio following previous deals with 20th Century Fox, NASA and the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Day episode comprises 10 levels in the Facebook game, including pig characters based on the three band members: Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool. The band&apos;s new single Oh Love features in the game, alongside an additional, exclusive track called Troublemaker. More music and levels will follow later in the Autumn, as Green Day release three albums Uno, Dos and Tre in four months. It&apos;s the first time Rovio has worked with a music artist in this way, although the company&apos;s chief executive Mikael Hed was mooting such partnerships at the Midem music industry conference in January 2012. Rovio&apos;s marketing chief Peter Vesterbacka explained the partnership to The Guardian. &quot;We have been contacted by a lot of different music artists for areas like co-promotions, and we have talked to lots of labels,&quot; he said. &quot;We had been looking to give the pigs a more prominent role in the games, and when we started talking to [label] Warner and the Green Day management, we realised it was a very good fit.&quot; For now, the levels will only be available in the Facebook game, rather than the iOS and Android versions of Angry Birds Friends. Vesterbacka hinted that the partnership may extend to mobile devices in the future, though. &quot;We haven&apos;t announced anything besides the Facebook stuff that is live now, but we view this as a first step in a much bigger co-operation,&quot; he said. &quot;Our fans and Green Day&apos;s fans should expect more of the same surprise and delight. We always want to surprise people!&quot; Vesterbacka is keen to describe this as a two-way partnership, rather than one brand piggybacking on the other. &quot;For us, it&apos;s bringing Angry Birds to more people, and it&apos;s the same thing for Green Day, bringing their music to a new audience,&quot; he said, noting that Green Day have sold 70m albums, and have notched up 25m Likes for their Facebook profile. &quot;That&apos;s 4m more than we have, so they are pretty big! A lot of people that play Angry Birds haven&apos;t listened to Green Day before, and a lot of fans of Green Day haven&apos;t played Angry Birds before. On both sides, we want to expand the fanbase and expose more people to Angry Birds and Green Day, so it&apos;s a very good fit. It&apos;s two big green brands...&quot; Rovio&apos;s last publicly-announced milestone for the Angry Birds games was 1bn total downloads back in May 2012, although Vesterbacka says the company is now focusing more on its drive to get to &quot;1bn fans&quot; of its franchise across games, animation and other products. &quot;People often think I&apos;m joking when I say we&apos;re only getting started, but that&apos;s still our perspective,&quot; he said. &quot;We have some pretty interesting other things in the pipeline for this year, and we&apos;re slowly getting to where we ought to be: making Angry Birds a pop culture phenomenon.&quot;",

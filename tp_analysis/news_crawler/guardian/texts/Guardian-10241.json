    "text": "There is a question which has been gnawing away at me for some time. It gnawed deeply when I read your piece (Why Eton still runs Britain, G2, 14 November). How many of our leading establishment figures owe their expensive education to parents who paid their Eton fees of over 30,000 a year from money parked in overseas tax-free accounts? I ask because the British who do pay tax are struggling to pay painfully inadequate benefits to their very poorest fellow citizens. It seems irrational to tax those benefits, but &quot;everyone must pay&quot; is the mantra echoing around city halls in England and Wales. Benefits which we taxpayers have provided in the interests of justice, good health and the relief of poverty are now to be taxed by many local authorities, despite inevitable consequential debt and misery. I hope our new Etonian archbishop will note the comments of archbishop Oscar Romero in 1978: &quot;When the church hears the cry of the oppressed it cannot but denounce the social structures that give rise to and perpetuate the misery from which the cry arises.&quot;Rev Paul NicolsonTaxpayers Against Poverty  A boy&apos;s boarding school that costs more than the average UK salary, a piano lesson with a teacher standing over the pupil with a clipboard  Andy Beckett&apos;s account of Eton was one of mediocrity, segregation and money. Rather than being &quot;a breeding ground for leadership&quot;, Eton is a breeding ground for class privilege  you get what you pay for. The shame is that so many British parents see state education as second rate and the likes of Eton as something to aspire to, lobbying for house systems and uniforms which do nothing in themselves to enhance educational experience or opportunity. Paying school fees does not buy better education  private education just aims to make its pupils believe they are better than the rest of us.Alison HiggsLondon  The tutor for admissions at Eton tells us that some 250 boys at the school are currently in receipt of a &quot;scholarship&quot; of some size or other (Letters, 13 November), and clearly expects us to applaud. When will people realise that scholarships awarded by public schools to pupils at state schools do three things: they enable that public school to convince the charity commissioners that they are meeting the criterion for charitable status, thus enabling the school to gain tax relief on their income; they &quot;cream off&quot; the best of the talent from the state sector of education in the hope of boosting the average IQ of their own establishment; and they render truly &quot;comprehensive&quot; provision in the state sector a logical impossibility.J Brian Harrison-JenningsHuddersfield  Eton doesn&apos;t still run Britain. Rather, members of the class that still runs Britain send their children to Eton (or Harrow, Winchester, Cheltenham College, Gordonstoun, Roedean etc). For most of their pupils, that makes them rather expensive finishing schools, since the important stuff, the social connections, are in place well before they arrive (or are born, since that seems to be the traditional moment to put a sprog&apos;s name down).Richard JenkinsSheffield  Andy Beckett writes: &quot;Whether Eton would then become a genuinely inclusive place is open to doubt.&quot; It certainly is open to doubt. All Etonians are boys  girls are totally excluded from whatever &quot;benefits&quot; such an education could offer.Judy HalesMawdesley, Lancashire  Why Eton still runs Britain? Surely, it should have been &quot;how&quot; Eton still runs Britain. Explaining how might make more of us ask &quot;why&quot;.Allen IvesLondon  Is it ironic or deliberate that Gove&apos;s retrograde diktats come at a time when our systems  Sure Start, nursery, excellent primary, and now secondary  have begun to produce the best-educated young people we&apos;ve ever had (Tough exams and learning by rote are the keys to success, 14 November)? I suspect a determination to return most of us to &quot;knowing our place&quot;, as expressed by Andrew Mitchell. Perhaps Gove schools should be known as &quot;fact-ories&quot;.Sue JolleyAltrincham, Cheshire  This article was amended on 15 November 2012. In the original, Sue Jolley&apos;s letter referred to Austin Mitchell; the MP she meant was Andrew Mitchell. Also, the letter from Judy Hales said &quot;There is no mention that all Etonians are boys&quot;, but the article that the letter refers to describes Eton as &quot;a school of 1,300 13- to 18-year-old boys&quot;.",

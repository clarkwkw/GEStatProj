    "text": "In the wake of news that sleeping less than six hours a night skews the activity of hundreds of genes, readers have been sharing advice on how to get some decent shut-eye.  ToBaldlyGo kicked off the conversation by pondering the merits of alcohol before bedtime. lhumphrey responded:  @ToBaldlyGo - that&apos;s because having a drink at night &quot;to get you to sleep&quot; may knock you out but actually restricts your bodies ability to enter restorative, REM sleep throughout the night. You may have been asleep for longer but will actually wake up feeling less refreshed than you might expect. http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-2/101-109.htm  muscleguy responded to a question on how to reach the REM state:  @vegeta83 - To dream lots stimulate your mind to give it lots to work on overnight AND do enough vigorous exercise not too late* to make you tired enough to sleep well. That usually does it for me. *If you try and sleep too soon after vigorous exercise your heart rate and metabolism will still be uncomfortably elevated and can disrupt sleep.  On the subject of alcohol before bed, Mudhutter replied:  @lhumphrey - Well having a drink works for me, otherwise restless legs keep me awake.I&apos;m fine in the mornings, especially after a nice shower and walking my daughter to school, strong cup of tea and a read of the guardian.  Dresser1 offered this chemical concoction:  For those who have a hard time getting to sleep to begin with ~ try 2 tsps of powdered calcium/magnesium powder in a small amount of very warm water. It is a muscle relaxant &amp; can help the body to let go, the mind more easily follows &amp; it&apos;s easier to stay asleep. Might not work for everyone, but works deliciously for me &amp; many friends. Way better than alcohol, much better for you than sleeping pills. Just a thought.  Murbster recommended yoga:  I recently discovered that Yoga Nidra (Yogic sleep) helps me to not only sleep better, but also helps me manage stress and anxiety.It&apos;s also a great practice for parents of young children. I can&apos;t recommend it enough.There&apos;s some free resources via this link:http://www.yoganidranetwork.org/downloadsFor anyone in London this weekend, this would be a perfect introduction:http://www.thelifecentre.com/workshops-and-courses/tlc-workshops/yoga-nidra/  moxespana added:  @djshang - I tried the Da Vinci sleep schedule when I was in college in order to be awake for a longer period during the day (I felt days were too short). It involves going for several power naps during the day but meant you slept only two hours a day. I quit after a few weeks as I found it pretty boring to be awake at 4am with nothing to do and no one to talk to.  Finally chemtrek advised reading certain comment threads:  If you want to get to sleep, I suggest you read lots of right wing posts the tedium of reading the same nonsense again and again should do the trick,though I must warn you that anger can get in the way, but if you get past that you will have some unpleasant but memorable dreams.  Thanks for all your contributions. Do add your tips and tricks for a good night&apos;s sleep in the comment thread of the original article.",

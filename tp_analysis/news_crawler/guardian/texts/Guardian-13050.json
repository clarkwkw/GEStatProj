    "text": "Even the most motivated students don&apos;t tend to finish their degree with three year of relevant work experience under their belt. Anyone graduating from the Edinburgh College of Art graphic design programme however, will have spent three of their four years working for one of several in-house &quot;design agencies&quot; that are set up annually by final year students and work as profit-generating companies to meet genuine commercial briefs.  This isn&apos;t on top of students&apos; university work - it&apos;s part of it. One day of every undergraduate&apos;s week is allocated to the project, and each agency is guided by an established industry mentor.  The strength of the relationships fostered between the department and professional agencies &quot;is above and beyond regular academic/industry contact,&quot; says programme head Zoe Patterson.  And the project also encourages less experienced students to learn from those who&apos;ve been studying - and working - for longer. &quot;It is rare in academia that students work across the year groups of a programme, even though the potency of peer feedback is undoubted,&quot; she says.  Students enjoy the independence and the chance to take responsibility for a job that inevitably matters far more to a paying client than an assignment ever will to a tutor. &quot;We are now in a position where we get to make the big decisions, but with this freedom comes a lot of hard work and responsibility which mirrors the reality of graphic design,&quot; says one undergraduate.  Another explains how management skills are developed as students run their own jobs and lead a team. &quot;I have learned that every individual, whether shy, quiet or who is different to me, should be allowed equal opportunity to have their opinions heard.&quot; The graduates who emerge will have experience of applying and being interviewed for jobs by their more experienced peers, and of pitching for work with a range of clients. They also gain an understanding of the way the industry is moving and what skills are in demand: &quot;all the design jobs you don&apos;t know exist until you&apos;re in design yourself,&quot; explains Patterson. &quot;You can tell people a million times what&apos;s out there, but until they experience it and are part of it, they&apos;re not really going to know what that means.&quot; The long term relationships that are built with mentors working in commercial design agencies mean students have the chance to show, over a period of years, rather than just a few weeks on placement, what they&apos;re made of. The project, says one mentor, is &quot;almost like a dating agency, whereby design agencies can meet and get to know the students, and if things go well, start a permanent relationship.&quot; Three years embroiled in real-life commercial design means that students hit the job market with a huge advantage: they&apos;ve done the job and can prove it.  &quot;We see a lot of graduates who just aren&apos;t prepared,&quot; says of the Design Agency&apos;s mentors. &quot;This project is a chance to help the students understand what a design consultancy is looking for.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

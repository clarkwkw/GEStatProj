    "text": "The Crysis series has long tried to stand apart from the first-person shooter herd, partly through system-shattering hardware demands to accommodate bleeding-edge graphics, and partly by adopting a sci-fi narrative at a time when modern military-styled rivals were proliferating. This third instalment ups the ante for hero Prophet, pitting him against not only the combined forces of shady mega-corp Cell and the invading Ceph aliens, but also his own diminishing humanity thanks to the combat nanosuit that empowers him. Journeying through the overgrown ruins that were once New York provides some of Crysis&apos;s finest imagery yet, and coupled with exhilarating combat there&apos;s more than enough to please anyone uninterested in the plot&apos;s weighty contemplations on the nature of humanity. Nanosuit abilities return, bringing invisibility, super-strength and regenerative powers, plus a huge assortment of fanciful weaponry. The addition of a hi-tech war-bow, allowing stealth kills without dropping cover, dramatically changes things though, incentivising stealthy play. Unleashing silent carnage on enemies is gleefully enjoyable. While the story campaign is engaging, multiplayer offers some of the most inventive modes of any recent shooter, particularly &quot;Hunter&quot;, seeing you assimilate enemies to your side until only one remains. A beautiful and engrossing package, arguably the first blockbuster of the year.",

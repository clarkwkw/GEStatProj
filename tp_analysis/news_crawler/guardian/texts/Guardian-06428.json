On 5 June, the weather system over the Great Australian Bight cut out the oval-shaped hole from a blanket of marine stratocumulus clouds. The cloud hole, with a diameter that stretched as far as 620 miles across, was caused by sinking air associated with an area of high pressure near the surface. Globally, the average sea-level pressure is about 1013 millibars; at the centre of this high, pressures topped 1,040 millibars Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA       There have been many images of the full disc of Earth from space  a view often referred to as 'the Blue Marble' but few have looked quite like this. Using natural-colour images from the visible/infrared imaging radiometre suite (VIIRS) on the recently launched Suomi-NPP satellite, a Nasa scientist has compiled a new view showing the Arctic and high latitudes Photograph: VIIRS/Suomi-NPP/NASA       Dust formed a giant arc over the Red Sea on 20 June 2012. Dust stretched from hundreds of kilometres inland in Sudan across the Red Sea, skirting the border of Eritrea, and not quite reaching the shores of Saudi Arabia. A vast network of impermanent rivers, or wadis, stretches across Sudan. Fine sediments from these wadis can be lofted into the air and carried long distances by wind Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA       The so-called linear dunes shown here in the Great Sand Sea of south-west Egypt are easily spotted from space, and local maps show that they rise 20 to 30 metres above the surrounding plains. The distance between dunes is interestingly regular, at 1.5-2.5km, suggesting some equilibrium exists between the wind strength and the sand supply. It is possible that the linear dunes are a reflection of earlier times, when winds were stronger or sand more plentiful. The dark rock outcrops at image lower left stand above the surface by as much as 150m. North winds have been deflected around this high zone, and smaller secondary linear dunes appear along the left side of the image, aligned with local winds that become ever more north-easterly as they approach the outcrops. A dune-free zone on the protected downwind side of the outcrop gives a sense of the sand movement Photograph: ISS/NASA       The Okavango Delta is an oasis in Africas Kalahari Desert. When the Kalahari reaches its driest phasewhen plants wither and animals hunt for drinking water  the Okavango provides it. But starting in 2009, the delta provided more than usual, and excess water overflowed into other land depressions in the region Photograph: ALI/EO-1/NASA       The border region of southern Kenya and northern Tanzania, with a small portion of south-eastern Uganda, is pictured in this image on 4 January 2012. In the lower-right portion of the image, we can see the snows of Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain at 5895m above sea level. North of Mount Kilimanjaro is Mount Kenya, the second-highest mountain in Africa. The area pictured is part of the East African Rift, an area where two tectonic plates are moving apart from one another, making this home to a number of both active and dormant volcanoes Photograph: MERIS/Envisat/ESA       June 6 marked the 100th anniversary of the largest eruption of the 20th century, the Novarupta  eruption of 1912. More than 13.5 cubic kilometres (3 cubic miles) of molten rock, or magma, blasted out of the Earth. Another 17 cubic kilometres of ash and volcanic debris spewed into the air or rolled across the hillside in pyroclastic flows. And it all happened in a matter of 60 hours. 'That is a rate of nearly 220m cubic meters per hour, which is roughly 520m tonnes per hour,' wrote volcanologist and blogger Erik Klemetti. By volume, it was three times the size of the Pinatubo eruption and 30 times that of Mount St Helens. But because of the remote location where the Alaskan Peninsula starts to stretch into the Bering Sea the sparse population, and the infancy of the modern study of volcanology, it was decades before scientists could tease out the details and attribute it to the right volcano Photograph: LANDSAT 7/NASA       On 18 June 2012, a total of 198 wildfires burned across Russia and had charred an area that covered 8,330 hectares. Many were in central Russia, where firefighters have battled uncontrolled fires for months. The latest flare-up prompted Russian authorities to declare a state of emergency in seven regions, including the Khanty-Mansiisk autonomous area, the Tyva Republic, the Sakha Republic, Krasnoyarsk, Amur, Zabaikalsky, and Sakhalin. Active fires are shown with red outlines. Numerous fires are burning through taiga in Krasnoyarsk (bottom), and a large pall of smoke to the south covers much of Tomsk (top). According to Russian authorities, many of the fires started when people lost control of agricultural fires and campfires. However, lightning sparked some of the blazes as well. According to the environmental group Greenpeace, more land in Russia has burned this year than in 2010, a year that intense wildfires affected western Russia and produced rare pyrocumulus 'fire clouds' Photograph: MODIS/Terra/NASA       Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is highlighted in this image. The largest city in Denmark, Copenhagen is located on the eastern side of the island of Zealand (left) and on the island of Amager (right). The island visible east of Amager is Saltholm, translated as Salt Islet. The white structure southwest of Saltholm is the artificial island of Peberholm, translated as Pepper Islet. Peberholm was created as part of the Oresund Bridge, a combined two-track rail and four-lane road bridge-tunnel across the Oresund Strait that connects Copenhagen with the Swedish city of Malmo. Peberholm serves as a crossover point between the bridge, completed in 2000, and the 4050m long Drogden Tunnel. Copenhagen airport is visible as an L-shaped, white structure on the eastern side of Amager Photograph: SPOT-4/ESA       A layer of stratocumulus clouds over the Pacific Ocean served as the backdrop for this rainbow-like optical phenomenon known as a glory. Glories generally appear as concentric rings of colour in front of mist or fog. They form when water droplets within clouds scatter sunlight back toward a source of illumination (in this case the sun). Another notable feature in this image are the swirling von karman vortices that are visible to the right of the glory. The alternating double row of vortices form in the wake of an obstacle, in this instance the eastern Pacific island of Guadalupe Photograph: MODIS/Terra/NASA       Kilauea continues to earn its reputation as Earths most active volcano. Since January 1983, Kilauea has coated much of the south-east coast of Hawaii in fresh lava. The centre of the eruption is Puu Oo - a crater south-east of Kilaueas summit. During May and June 2012, fresh lava emerged at Puu Oo, then travelled through lava tubes down Kilaueas steep slopes. The lava emerged on the pali (a Hawaiian word for cliff) and on the coastal plain, further down the mountainside Photograph: ALI/EO-1/NASA       On 10 February 2011, disaster struck the &oumlllolar coalfield in central Turkey, near the city of Elbistan. The north-eastern wall of an open-pit mine collapsed, sending about 50m tonnes of material into the mine. The debris buried and killed 10 workers. The material mined at the &oumlllolar coalfield is lignite, a brown type of coal that is generally younger and softer than bituminous or anthracite. Turkey relies on lignate for 21% of its electric power production, and the Afsin-Elbistan lignite basin contains about half of Turkeys lignate reserves. Turkey has the highest fatality rate for miners in the world, with 133 deaths for every 100,000 miners in Turkey, according to data released in 2011. As of 19 June, the llolar coalfield was still closed pending the outcome of a lawsuit Photograph: ALI/EO-1/NASA       A broad band of smoke and haze continued to hang over eastern China on 12 June 2012 hovering above dozens of smoldering fires and obscuring large swaths of land from view. Red hotspots, many with gray smoke plumes pouring from them, mark actively burning fires. Most of the fires lie at the eastern edge of the North China Plain, one of Chinas most important agricultural regions. On 1 June, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) reported that the major winter wheat producing provinces of Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu will begin wheat harvest in June. These are the same provinces where the majority of the fires are actively burning. Given the time of year and the distribution of the fires in areas of active wheat harvest, it is likely that most of these fires are agricultural in origin, and deliberately set to burn stubble from wheat fields after harvest Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA       Smoke from wildfires over the western United States Photograph: GOES/Reuters       The intensity and scope of the heat wave in the western United States in this map of land surface temperature anomalies for 17-24 June 2012. Based on data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) on Nasa's Terra satellite, the map depicts temperatures compared to the 2000-2011 average for the same eight-day period in June Photograph: NASA       This image shows the Pine Island glacier in west Antarctica and reveals a crack in the glaciers tongue about 25km long. The image was acquired by Envisats radar on 6 April 2012, just two days before contact with the satellite was lost. Over its 10-year lifetime, Envisats radar imagery was constantly used to monitor ice in the Antarctic. Satellite radars are particularly useful over polar regions because they can see through clouds and darkness Photograph: Envisat/ESA       The Paran River cuts through this image of southern Brazil. In the area pictured, the river marks the borders of the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso do Sul to the north and west, So Paulo to the east and Paran to the south. Agricultural structures are evident in the surrounding land. Near the centre of the image, smoke from a fire was captured blowing south-west from its source Photograph: Envisat/ESA       A short-lived but beautiful storm, tropical storm Kuena formed off of the northern tip of Madagascar on 6 June 2012. In this image the storm has a tight circulation with a clouded eye, with streaks of clouds extending from the centre towards the periphery, overlying the spiraling storm bands. Shortly after this image was captured, Kuena was reported to have sustained winds near 40mph/64.8kph and was moving to the west. By the afternoon of the following day the wind speeds of Kuena had steadily weakened Photograph: MODIS/Terra/NASA       Along the Pacific coast of Honduras and Nicaragua, in the Gulf of Fonseca, the landscape has changed over the past 40 years. An aquaculture industry has developed, producing a bountiful harvest of shrimp within sight of coastal mangroves and wetlands. The shrimp farms also produce a rich harvest of arguments, with some people seeing an economic success story and a reasonable use of coastal land, while others decry unnecessary and destructive changes to wetlands. In this picture tidal (salt) flats are shades of beige and grey, mangroves are dark green and edged in brown, and inland agricultural lands are shades of brown and light green. Shrimp ponds are mostly rectangular in shape. When active and filled, the ponds take on green hues because of the phytoplankton (algae, diatoms, blue-green algae) growing in the water. When drained, the ponds are grey because of the salty, clay-filled bottom Photograph: Lansat 5/NASA       The Sor Kaydak is a salt marsh that leads into the north-eastern bulb of the Caspian Sea. This land depression is occasionally inundated by water from the Caspian Sea, as both the marsh and the Sea lie at the same elevation 29 metres below global sea level. They are separated by a low bar of land that is just 1-2m high. The central 50km of the 180km-long marsh depression is shown in this astronaut photograph from the International Space Station Photograph: ISS/NASA  ",

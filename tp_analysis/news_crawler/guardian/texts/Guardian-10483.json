    "text": "A student rugby club has been banned from playing after its members dressed up as disgraced TV star Jimmy Savile, his victims and police for a night out. The bad taste fancy-dress night by members of St Cuthbert&apos;s Society men&apos;s rugby club, of Durham University, reportedly featured one person stripping off, the attempted theft of a dartboard from a rival college bar, and a fire alarm being set off at another venue. St Cuthbert&apos;s  one of the university&apos;s most successful college sides  has been banned from playing for the rest of the term after first-year players dressed up as young girls, second years wore Savile outfits, and third and fourth years came as police officers or Panorama journalists. Members have also been banned from at least two college bars. A Durham University spokesman said: &quot;The university has been made aware of an incident. We take such matters very seriously. The students&apos; college has investigated the incident and disciplinary action is being taken.&quot; It is understood organisers of the event, on 25 October, have been ordered to carry out unpaid work and 50 fines have been imposed on players. St Cuthbert&apos;s celebrates its 125th anniversary next year and counts BBC news presenter Kate Silverton among its alumni.",

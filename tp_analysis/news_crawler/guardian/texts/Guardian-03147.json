    "text": "It is always a dilemma for a newspaper to tell a complicated story such as that about bees and pesticides (The end of the beeline: how pesticides stop bees finding their way home, 30 March). As a beekeeper of 40 years and inventor of the Zest hive (designed to improve bee health), I feel entitled to join the debate. The Defra spokesperson&apos;s elucidation of its position of pompous, supine neglect regarding chemicals such as neonicotinoids is revealing. It claims a robust system for assessment in this country. By implication Germany, France and Italy, which have banned neonicotinoids, are wrong. Do they have different evidence or a different interpretation of it? The spokesperson says &quot;neonicotinoids do not pose an unacceptable risk if they are used properly&quot;. Why should my bees&apos; health be determined by some farm worker who does not or cannot read the label? What redress do I have when my bees are killed? The British Beekeepers Association has again been asleep (or pretended to be) on the job, taking the Defra fence-sitting position regarding neonicotinoids.Bill SummersSturminster Newton, Dorset The kneejerk response of the pesticide industry and our subservient government to new research implicating pesticide use for killing bees is not surprising. Pesticides usually work by disrupting the chemical metabolism of those animals (not just the &quot;pests&quot;) that feed on the plants, including humans. Research into pesticide impact on the environment is not only extremely difficult, involving monitoring over long periods and meticulous testing; it is also viciously opposed by the pesticide industry. Scientists know that all pesticides have a deleterious effect on the environment and circumstantial evidence also implicates them in the development of human cancers, allergies and other illnesses. But industrial agriculture has become so reliant on large-scale pesticide use, and the corporations selling the stuff have a vested interest in suppressing any research that shows they are essentially poisonous for all living organisms. The use of synthesised pesticides should be phased out as a matter of urgency for the long-term survival of our world. John GreenEaling, Middlesex The debate over bee deaths and declines is an old story by now, but British experts have long chosen to ignore what competent continentals have discovered. Beekeepers&apos; cumulative experience and observations are treated in this country as of no scientific merit. So it is for many widely held views that powerful lobbies prefer to disregard. The worry is that the same chemicals are commonplace on garden centre shelves and widely used in composts for pot plants to combat vine weevil, and therefore may be in the pollen and nectar of even city bees.Colin LeakeyLincoln I welcome the latest study by the team at Stirling, which will hopefully shake Defra out of its slumber on the matter of pollinator decline due to pesticides. The British Beekeepers Association had taken thousands of pounds from Bayer until a membership revolt last year stopped the practice. Sadly, the BBKA has allowed the spray liaison scheme, whereby farmers inform local beekeepers of planned spraying, to disintegrate. Now beekeepers have no warnings, and farmers are in breach of pesticide usage regulations. The normal response of government scientists to claims that neonicotinoids are harmful to bees is to deny that there is any irrefutable evidence of a direct link. This attitude is primarily based upon a misunderstanding of the complex way neonicotinoids affect pollinators. Fortunately, the European Food Safety Agency is tightening up pesticide safety regulations as a response to the different modus operandi of these chemicals and this may lead to a more sophisticated interpretation of safety test data in future. There is a real lack of independent in-depth research into the effect of neonicotinoids, and so I am grateful to Prof Goulson and his team. But more research, independent of Bayer and the agrochemical industry, is urgently required.Dr Bernie DoeserDirector, Small Blue Marble",

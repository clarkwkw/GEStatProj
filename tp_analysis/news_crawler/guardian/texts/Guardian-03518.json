    "headline": "Spring must thaw more than academics journals", 
    "text": "The Guardian&apos;s coverage of the call for free access to academic journals was the latest salvo in what has been dubbed the Academic Spring. Much has been made about the greediness of academic publishers (George Monbiot went as far as saying they make Rupert Murdoch look like a socialist), who are earning a 35% profit on research paid for largely by the public through taxes. The problems inherent to the current model, including access to journals and high costs for cash strapped university libraries, are many, and they are finally receiving due attention. But what would a world of free academic content look like? My own background is in the humanities and social sciences, which have received less attention in this offensive on journals. Taking into account at least two pressing problems in these areas of research - sharing between disciplines and the need to reach a wider audience beyond academia - free access to journals may have a disappointingly negligible effect unless underlined by a wider sea change in thinking. Firstly, too many academics succumb to a bunker mentality. Throughout the various fields, there are disparate methodological approaches and jargon phrases strictly adhered to, which often seem foreign to someone unfamiliar with that particular parlance. This inhibits the sharing and cross-referencing of research between different fields. Indeed, in fields as related as history and political science, it can often seem like researchers are speaking completely different languages. The result is groupthink within disciplines and ignorance of potentially enriching research by others. Opening up academic publishing offers the chance to address this problem concretely by making journals more accessible and by using technology that makes it easier to scan journals outside of one&apos;s field for relevant information. But a larger change in the academy is necessary to topple the walls that have been erected between disciplines. This should begin with grad students being required to have basic knowledge in the methodological approaches of fields outside of their speciality, which might encourage soon-to-be academics to embrace newly free material. Moreover, more accessible and transparent links must be forged between various faculties, something that could perhaps be centrally administered by libraries. As Bjrn Brembs, a neurobiologist at Free University Berlin has said, libraries could receive the money currently given to journals. This could enable them to assume additional functions. On the second point, it is true that free journals could help universities reach a wider audience, providing general educational benefits to non-academics. Yet one of the primary reasons academics struggle to reach the general public is because what they churn out is too often so arcane and laden with unnecessary jargon that only a handful of experts in their own field can comprehend it. I am not the first, nor will I be the last, to attack dull academic writing, but a different model in publishing might present new momentum for overdue change. A good rule of thumb was imparted to me by a former professor of mine, who cautioned that if my non-academic friends, whose taxes were in part subsidising my education, could not read what I produced, something was wrong. Again, this could begin before one enters into academia, by encouraging a fluid and accessible writing style and discouraging technicality which may be easier to write but more difficult to read. The gap between serious academic writing and pandering is not such that a clear and engaging style runs the risk of falling through the crack. So it would seem that creating an easier way to access information is indeed a positive step, but the academia must also concern itself with how to encourage academics and the wider public alike to actually seek research out.

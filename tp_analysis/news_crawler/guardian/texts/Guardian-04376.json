    "headline": "Can the Wii U and Super Mario come to the rescue of console gaming?", 
    "text": "A new Mario game to go with a new Nintendo console? It&apos;s a surprise like having a giant turkey dinner presented to you around lunchtime on 25 December is a surprise. It&apos;s a surprise like slumping into a chocolate-smeared sugar coma at some point on Easter Sunday. What I&apos;m clumsily saying is, the new Super Mario Bros game being unveiled at industry mega-conference E3 to go with Nintendo&apos;s Wii U console isn&apos;t much of a surprise at all. Since his birth as &quot;Jumpman&quot; in 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong, wherever Nintendo has gone, Mario has come too. The SNES, N64, Wii, DS: he&apos;s nabbed coins, busted Koopas and rescued princesses on all of them. And he&apos;s not just a company mascot. Unlikely as it seems when you think about it, this Japanese version of an Italian-American stereotype has been an international icon for the last three decades. His lush moustache and bulbous nose make up the face of gaming generally to a lot of people  up there with Hello Kitty and Mickey Mouse in &quot;bigger than Jesus&quot; territory. That&apos;s true even though gaming has changed an extraordinary amount since Mario first platformed into public consciousness. Characters have moved from sprites to polygons, to eerily lifelike motion-capture performances  but there&apos;s no chance of Mario making a dimensional leap into realism. He&apos;s warmly, resolutely cartoonish. And while the biggest console games have become increasingly &quot;adult&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; (read: beardy and gunny), Mario&apos;s stuck to a stupendously successful, primary-coloured mix of perfectly crafted platforming. Of course, that&apos;s not all he&apos;s done. Mario&apos;s had some interesting sidelines over the years, from racer to tennis ace to brawler in Super Smash Bros. And while he&apos;s played the hero many times by rescuing Princess Peach, he&apos;s clearly got a dark side  as anyone who&apos;s been on the wrong end of a blue shell in a Mario Kart game can tell you. All the same, you can trust Mario: he might make you curse, but he&apos;s never going to start dropping F-bombs himself or blowing up the place with rocket-propelled grenades. And his relationship with Peach might not be exactly equal (developer Tim Schafer tweeted a story about playing games with his daughter: &quot;Today [she] asked me, &apos;Who does Princess Peach save?&apos; Is now a good time to tell her everything that&apos;s wrong with the world?&quot;) it&apos;s got an endearing innocence that seems positively puritan compared with the self-conscious sleaze that&apos;s increasingly the norm in more grittily styled games like Hitman. Now Mario has to make another jump. The arrival of Wii U is more than just another stage in the inexorable upgrading of console technology. The tablet controller shows that Nintendo knows its most serious competition is no longer from Microsoft and Sony. It&apos;s not console-v-console anymore: instead, all three find themselves scrapping to win an audience that&apos;s quietly gone over to touchscreen devices. Why switch on the box in the corner when you&apos;re likely to be carrying something in your pocket that will give you just as much joy for less fuss and less expense? Nintendo&apos;s pre-E3 video was partly a portrait of the tragic plight of the smartphone family: gathered in the living, all lost in their own handheld world, all waiting for Wii U to show up and reunite them. That&apos;s Mario&apos;s next challenge. He&apos;s not battling Bowser this time; instead, he&apos;s in a life-or-death struggle to draw gamers out of their technological islands and back into shared experiences where consoles still count. It&apos;s a lot for one plumber to do, but if anyone can  with a jump, a power-up and a cheeky cry of &quot;It&apos;s a-me!&quot;  surely it&apos;s Mario.

    "headline": "An idea that could release Labour from its own inertia", 
    "text": "I am not really a fan of Michael Gove&apos;s policies. You may have noticed. But agree with him or not, he does the big picture, broad-brush stuff very effectively. In speech after speech since 2010, he has painted an ever more vivid image of his idealised school system: the valiant heads and teachers (well, those who aren&apos;t in a union) and the young people liberated into the world of Dryden, Pope, rote learning and commas. It is not to everyone&apos;s taste but it has served two useful purposes from his point of view. It has cast a spell over the media, and appears to have stunned the opposition, insufficiently confident in the alternative arguments, into complete inertia. This is a shame, as on closer inspection the Gove canvas is starting to look like one of those paintings where the paint chips away to reveal, not a great masterpiece, but a second-rate dud. Nearly every week there is a new clue about what may lie beneath. The Swedish free school chain, run by private equity, goes bust; the US charter school scandals build up; stories seep out about wasteful public expenditure and unaccountable personal extravagance in academies, as does mounting evidence that no one &quot;type&quot; of school has a monopoly on success. But the clearest picture of the sheer legal complexity of life after Gove is laid bare by barrister David Wolfe in this quarter&apos;s Education Law Journal. I first met Wolfe 10 years ago, when he explained to me the legal ramifications of what were then the fledgling Labour city academies. On the one hand, there were volumes of primary and secondary legislation, guidance and codes of practice that had built up over generations to govern maintained schools, he explained. On the other, there was a slim volume known as the &quot;funding agreement&quot;, a short commercial contract between the secretary of state and the sponsoring trust. This would govern an academy school. The early Labour academies travelled so lightly when it came to legal requirements that funding agreements were mainly to do with money and property. Over time more comprehensive &quot;model&quot; funding agreements were introduced for each new wave of academies, and primary legislation has taken precedence to make academies subject to, for example, Freedom of Information and national requirements on permanent exclusions. Academy chains emerged, some with strings of separate schools, others with more autocratic &quot;master&quot; agreements covering all subsidiaries. The plethora of different schools we now see  academies, free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges  all have differing requirements in crucial matters like admissions, exclusions, the curriculum and governance, depending on how, why and when they were established. The consequences of this are starting to become clear. Parents and pupils in these schools are not protected in law, as they are in maintained schools, and can struggle to enforce their rights, as the recent case concerning the admission of an SEN child to the Mossbourne academy showed, and national policy changes will be hard to implement in future. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw is vigorously pursuing local authorities that fail in their responsibilities on standards, but in this byzantine system of regulation, fulfilling those duties is almost unmanageable. If a school fails, the only realistic option is what Wolfe bluntly calls &quot;inspect and terminate&quot;. And there is no clear exit strategy if a school no longer likes its sponsor, especially if it has no freestanding legal existence. The Wolfe article should be a flashing light to the Labour front bench. They may have to pick up the pieces as failure and parental disenchantment in some areas will inevitably follow. Converting all academies back into maintained schools would be a massive and costly undertaking. But Wolfe has a realistic practical proposal. An incoming government could form a clearer view about the governance, rights, responsibilities and freedoms that should apply to all schools, so that school &quot;type&quot; no longer mattered, then introduce legislation to override the funding agreements, with a clearer definition of the local authority&apos;s role in support and challenge. Labour could find a voice to express this because it is about restoring coherence, maintaining high standards and strengthening the power of parents, schools and pupils, without being seen to go back to a mythical municipal past  something the party appears to fear more than anything else. It would be a different, but equally bold, picture to Gove&apos;s, and the politics of education would become a lot more interesting.

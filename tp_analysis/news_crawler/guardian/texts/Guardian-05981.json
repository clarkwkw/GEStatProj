    "text": "   Andrei Chirila, Rio+20 Photograph: Habitat for Humanity for the Guardian    In Romania, like in many other former communist countries in eastern Europe, the notion of democracy has been interpreted very differently, depending on each person: from abusive privatisations to uncontrolled exploitation of forests, from unauthorised constructions to education programmes carried out by unskilled or poorly trained people. If the period that followed the 1989 revolution has been turbulent and transitional, like we Romanians like to call it, this was due to our unique way of interpreting things. We love to reinvent the wheel, again and again, to put forth the same amount of effort to go down the same road made by others, just to arrive, best case scenario, in the same place. Our concern should be to focus on finding a balance in everything we do, whether we talk about social protection interfering with economics, or with environmental issues. We have been preoccupied for too long with how we look and feel; how our house looks instead of caring about how energy efficient it is; how big our car is instead of caring about its maintenance costs and how polluting it is, and now it is impossible to change all these at once. There have been many changes in recent years, especially when we talk about civil society: people seem to be more concerned about their future, their savings, about efficient exploitation of resources and the community they live in. Taking part in eco-actions, helping others, supporting disadvantaged groups, protecting animals, were at first a trend. But then they became a way of life  of thinking and acting  for a lot of us, because we started to believe in what they stand for.",

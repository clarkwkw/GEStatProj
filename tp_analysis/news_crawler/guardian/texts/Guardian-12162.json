    "text": "Our most stunning evening sky of the year sees Orion striding across the meridian between the brightest star Sirius and the even brighter Jupiter. The giant planet is unmistakable high in the SE and above Orion at nightfall, moving into the SW by our map times as Orion reaches the SSW and Sirius scintillates low down in the S. Jupiter is slow-moving against the stars of Taurus, almost in line between Aldebaran and the Pleiades, and dims slightly this month from mag -2.5 to -2.3 as its distance grows from 687 million to 753 million km. It is still, though, the target of choice for all those shiny new Christmas telescopes, its cloud-banded disc appearing 40 arcsec across when it lies alongside the Moon on the night of the 18th. Decent binoculars should reveal its four main moons. Saturn rises in the ESE by 01:25 on the 1st and 23:20 on the 28th, and is the brightest object in the lower SE sky by the time Jupiter sets in the NW six hours after the map times. Now at mag 0.5 in W Libra, 18 to the left of Spica, Saturn shows a 17 arcsec disc at midmonth, set within rings that are 40 arcsec wide and tipped 19 towards us. Mercury is well placed in our evening twilight, its altitude in the WSW 40 minutes after sunset improving from 4 on the 5th to 9 during the middle of the month. It dims from magnitude -1.1 to 0.5 by the 21st, then more rapidly as it sinks lower and disappears. Binoculars may show the fainter Mars (mag 1.2) which stands only 15 arcmin (half a Moon-width) left of Mercury on the 8th. The 45-metre asteroid 2012 DA14 may brighten to the 7th mag as it sweeps within about 27,700km of the Indian Ocean on the 15th. It is unlikely to be visible without a telescope as it climbs through our NE sky and cuts through the Plough later that evening.

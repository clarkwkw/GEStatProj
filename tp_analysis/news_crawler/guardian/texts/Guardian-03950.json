    "text": "You might think that our towns and cities are so jam-packed with human inhabitants, that there&apos;s little room for the rest of the animal kingdom. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Our cities are a mosaic of &quot;micro-habitats&quot; providing food, water, green spaces and places to breed  the natural equivalent of a five-star hotel. Hence the presence of a huge range of animals, from badgers to bats, hawkmoths to herons, and sparrows to seals.. This Saturday, we aim to prove that wildlife doesn&apos;t simply survive in urban areas, it thrives. We look at the history of urban wildlife and city dwellers&apos; enduring love of nature. Our illustrated spotter&apos;s guides will help kids identify what&apos;s out there, we pinpoint wildlife hotspots across the UK and three &quot;nature champions&quot; reveal what inspires their commitment to urban wildlife.  So if you live in a town, city or suburb, make the most of it this summer by tracking down your local city critters. Share your finds with us on Twitter (#outandabout). Happy spotting! Don&apos;t miss our Spotter&apos;s Guide to Urban Wildlife - free on Saturday 19 May with the Guardian. ",

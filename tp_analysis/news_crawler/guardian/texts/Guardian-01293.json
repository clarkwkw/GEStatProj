    "text": "The Ucas figures record applications from full-time students hoping to start university in 2012 but offer no room for complacency (Editorial, 31 January). Recession and unemployment would normally trigger increased interest in higher education but the opposite has happened. It is also too early to reach any conclusions about the impact of the new fees regime on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Analysis linked with socio-economic class is only done when enrolments are known and provides much more robust evidence than the Ucas applications, which rely on limited data and only cover younger students. This is why the 11% drop in applications from mature students should start alarm bells ringing in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. One in three undergraduate students enters university for the first time when he/she is over 21. Many will not have had the opportunity to study for a degree before and they are more likely to be from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are also less likely to be the students with high A-level grades which the government has said universities can recruit in unlimited numbers at the highest fee. This is why the decision of ministers on 25 January to reduce by 15,000 the number of funded places in universities in 2012 is all the more significant. These will be lost from universities that traditionally recruit older students and they can only be recovered if the university lowers its average fee to 7,500. Higher education should be available to all those who have the ability and who might benefit regardless of age or background.Pam TatlowChief executive, million+  Simon Hughes says that students have apparently not been deterred from applying for university places by the hike in tuition fees (The truth about fees, 31 January), but that does not make it right that our young people should start their working lives saddled with debt to make up for the mistakes of our financial services sector. After all, with youth unemployment at record levels, what other options do they have?Julian D RoskamsMalvern, Worcestershire  Simon Hughes (and all the other supporters of 9,000 tuition fees) fails to mention that the majority of people starting university this year will be effectively taxed at 40% on all income above 21,000 for 30 years of their working lives. If they save for their old age, they will keep only 50p in every pound they earn. At the same time, his coalition partners want to abolish 50% tax rate on incomes over 150,000. What is fair about this?Catherine WykesDerby  Of course, for Professor Green, the drop in those applying for university is disappointing, naturally, considering his position (10% drop predicted in UK university applications, 30 January). However, we know that a lot of degrees are deemed worthless by employers, so the drop in numbers may not necessarily lead to a less skilled workforce. We need to widen the routes into the professions and other career paths instead of always putting so much emphasis on a university education. In finance and accountancy the apprenticeship route is a successful way into our profession, so much so that opportunities are very much increasing.Jane Scott PaulChief executive, Association of Accounting Technicians  The Ucas data for creative arts and design applications makes interesting reading for those of us swimming against the tide of fine art higher education (University applications: where did people apply and for which subjects?, 31 January). A commercial organisation would ask itself serious questions about the perceived value and actual content of its products and programmes if their its decision to increase prices resulted in the loss of 44,000 customers year-on-year. Students paying high tuition fees will rightly expect high levels of tuition, and precious few fine art courses offer that. Likewise, they will expect to be well prepared for life after education, and professional development seems to be at best an afterthought on many fine art degree courses. Students will vote with their feet and seek out independent-minded and independently funded courses which offer real preparation for a life of creativity. Good news for some at leastMark TattersallChief executive, The Art Academy, London",

    "text": "Just three repeated notes rang out with the volume of an alarm clock and I was minded to check the time. It was 3.35am. They were the first bars of a song thrush&apos;s morning song. High and shrill, they came through the curtains like silver shards in the smoky pre-dawn dullness. I sense that song thrush song evolves over the spring, and it achieves its finest quality about now. The birds are so widespread, from Claxton to Kinlochbervie, from Kenidjack to Kirkwall, that everyone could hear one. I recommend you take out the earphones or pull back the glass, and yield to their song, which will cease in a few weeks. When it begins in those leafless landscapes of February and March, the clean hard notes come pounding over the fields like cannon fire. The full dark canopies of June, however, soften and enrich the sound, and I love it most in the evenings, when the thrush himself, now well practised but perhaps busy with nests and chicks, seems less committed and mellower. The song lines sail out over the village, enfolding us all like music from distant church bells. Its main competitors for our premier bird music are the wonderful, insinuating, complex melodies of the blackbird. But blackbirds are not just ours. You can hear them just as well on Turkey&apos;s Lycian shore, or in the Elburz mountains of Iran, and westwards as far as those dark oleander-filled valleys of Andalusia. In fact you could carry on to the pre-desert, to those fig-shaded oases of the Anti-Atlas, and still find Morocco&apos;s dawn filled with blackbird. Song thrush song is altogether more restricted. The music has about it the smell of damp oak woods and pine, and one wonders if it was for these reasons that the British voted it their favourite birdsong?",

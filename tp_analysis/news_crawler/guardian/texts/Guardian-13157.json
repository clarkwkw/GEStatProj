    "text": "I&apos;m still wondering how Michael Gove admitted he was wrong on two key policies and came out of it almost politically unscathed. Looking at the media coverage of his climbdown on the English baccalaureate certificate and plans for a single examination board, you&apos;d be forgiven for thinking that the government had discarded a couple of inconsequential policy ideas or was merely postponing them to a later date. Neither is the case. Both were cornerstones of government education policy and had become shorthand for everything that ministers think is wrong with schools  a dumbed-down curriculum and a lowering of exam standards. The implications are far from minor. These policies had already led to significant changes in secondary school staffing and curriculum and the Secretary of State has wasted schools&apos; time and resources and guaranteed a continuing period of uncertainty. Whatever reasons Michael Gove gave for his change of mind, the truth is that the policies were deeply flawed and I doubt we&apos;ll hear much about them again. So why so little political damage to the government? First, the education world was, overwhelmingly, opposed to the EBC. The implications of narrowing the curriculum, the threat to arts and creativity and the devaluing of vocational qualifications were well understood. And I suspect that the reversal of policy was so welcome that most schools would rather not complain about a ministerial change of mind. The lack of criticism from the media is rooted elsewhere. Journalists  of all political persuasions  seem to have bought into Gove&apos;s view that things used to be better in the old days. They believe that Michael Gove is synonymous with &quot;rigour&quot; and, regardless of the mistakes he makes along the way, is a standard-bearer of a brand of Conservative politics that has a future. The policies that now seem to be top priorities  his proposed return to O-levels in all but name, his A-level reforms and national curriculum changes  are all headlined as bringing back rigour to education. The problem is, he can only understand this in relation to the type of education he himself experienced. It is time the word &quot;rigour&quot; was reclaimed. It belongs to the modern world and the modern curriculum just as much as it does to the days of Michael Gove&apos;s youth. Anyone who has seen a good drama or art lesson, watched the best sports teams or listened to a school band, cannot fail to recognise the rigour involved. They are perfect examples of the skills and attitudes the government says it wants to promote. No one who sees a child learning numbers in a group, rather than sitting in rows facing the teacher; or learning history by studying a portrait from the National Gallery rather than memorising the kings and queens of England, can deny the rigour of that learning. Yet this is the kind of pedagogy that has been undermined by the actions of the government. The good news is that we now know that Michael Gove is someone who can change his mind. It offers hope for the future. More worrying is the realisation that huge sections of the media  most of whom probably had a similar education to Michael Gove  also share his interpretation of what constitutes educational rigour and standards. This article was amended on 26.02.13 to clarify the name of the English baccalaureate certificate.",

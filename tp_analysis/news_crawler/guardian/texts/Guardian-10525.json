    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Wonderbook has patterns on its cardboard pages that PlayStation&apos;s camera recognises, creating an augmented reality view on screen that shows a magical animated book with spells and stories spilling from its pages. Your Move controller turns into a chunky wand making you a trainee wizard, learning spells and completing simple tasks. The experience of turning its pages and pointing the wand is compelling, but interactions are simplistic and occasionally frustrating. Its intended seven- to 12-year-old audience may have more patience, but this is an uninspiring start for Wonderbook.",

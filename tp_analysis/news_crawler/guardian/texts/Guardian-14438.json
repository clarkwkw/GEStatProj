    "text": "The latest Ross-CASE survey report on higher education philanthropic giving has been making headlines in recent days. UK universities saw record levels of both philanthropic donors and new funds raised in 2011-12, despite the wider economic picture. We&apos;re not talking about a small rise. Total new funds secured jumped by 14.4% from the previous report, itself a record. The number of alumni making donations rose 5%, to almost 170,000 people, and non-alumni donors increased by 11% to almost 44,000 people. The headline figures certainly indicate that higher education philanthropy is alive and well. However, as has been pointed out by some of the report&apos;s more eagle-eyed readers, the picture isn&apos;t quite as simple as that. The data shows that the overall results of a sustained focus on fundraising by universities over the past decade is, on the whole, paying off. But this masks huge variance in the performance of individual universities. While 39% of institutions saw an increase in new funds secured, almost three in 10 saw their new funds drop by more than 50%. What&apos;s behind this variation across the sector? Is it inevitable after the end of government initiatives like the matched funding scheme for voluntary giving? Certain commentators persist with the glass half-empty view that some institutions may never have the reputation or the alumni pool to attract high level philanthropy. This old argument falls apart as we see the rise of big gifts to a wider range of institutions, and the growth in non-alumni donors across the sector. Others see successful growth in some clusters of universities as inextricably linked to a fall elsewhere. This is not the case: it is rare that higher education institutions are directly competing for the same gift. A high-profile university donor speaking to fundraisers described the philanthropic pound as &apos;elastic&apos;, implying that the total pot is never finite. For the first time this year, the survey report investigated &apos;communities&apos; of universities which display similar fundraising characteristics and grouped them into five categories. They range from the &apos;elite fundraising programmes&apos;  containing just Oxford and Cambridge, who in this year&apos;s report were shown to have received 45% of all higher education institution donations  to the &apos;fragile fundraising programmes&apos;, consisting of 4% of the overall sample which spent more on fundraising activities than they received. The biggest group identified are those with &apos;emerging fundraising programmes&apos;, at 62% of those surveyed. This group is currently seeing a lower return on its fundraising efforts than the groups above it in the analysis, and only a few members have received a gift over 0.5m in the last three years. But many of these institutions are relatively new to fundraising and start-up costs are high. Looking at this analysis over the longer-term will prove insightful. So does the apparent gulf in the sector&apos;s performance mean that serious fundraising activity is only for a select few elite institutions? The 2011 European Commission paper, Giving in Evidence: Fundraising from Philanthropy in European Universities identified the Matthew Concept for philanthropy, suggesting that those that have more, receive more, and therefore the rich continue to get richer. A cursory glance at this year&apos;s survey in isolation  and particularly the Oxbridge figures  might appear to back this up. This is a pessimistic view and certainly doesn&apos;t represent the overall trend that the Ross-CASE data suggests. Yes, Oxford and Cambridge still attract the lion&apos;s share of donations, and their figures in absolute terms are dazzling and on the rise, but the data also shows that Oxbridge&apos;s proportion of the total dropped from 53% to 46%. This year&apos;s big winners when viewed in the context of previous reports are the non-Oxbridge Russell Group, whose proportion of donations are higher than ever, up from 26% to 38%. It is hugely encouraging to see more million pound gifts  such as Glaxo Smith Kline&apos;s 12m gift for an innovative carbon neutral sustainable chemistry laboratory at the University of Nottingham and the 20m gift to King&apos;s College London for the Dickson Poon School of Law  going to a wider range of institutions. The data also demonstrated that these institutions invested the most in their fundraising, and their return on investment was approximately 13 for every pound spent, compared to a lower figure of 4.50 for the rest of the sector. There are lessons here on investing money to make money. For the universities which are not in this group, there are reasons for optimism. The numbers of both alumni and non-alumni donors are on the rise  and why wouldn&apos;t they be? Giving to a university is the best way of contributing to world-class research tackling global and local issues. The University of Leicester&apos;s research in cardio-vascular disease among South Asian communities is generating support from donors who have never set foot on campus. Giving to a university can also support access to higher education, scholarships for students and the next generation of our professions. Universities across the sector are getting better at making their &apos;case for support&apos; and articulating the impact of a gift  big or small  to their institution. The act of making a regular gift to your alma mater is increasing but there is still some way to go to see this as normal behaviour for graduates. The end of the matched funding scheme has undoubtedly had an impact on this year&apos;s figures, but our analysis shows that a long-term approach to sustained fundraising works. The last decade has seen a transformation in the sector&apos;s approach, as the recent review of philanthropy in UK higher education, led by Professor Shirley Pearce, highlighted. It is now clear that there are drivers of success for university fundraising which institutions can adopt and adapt. Clarity about an institution&apos;s identity and its distinctiveness, investment in professional staff and operations, and sharing the learnings of those who are &quot;best in class&quot;, can benefit universities throughout the sector.

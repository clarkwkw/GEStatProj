    "text": "Some critics of wind power have started to make the claim that windfarms actually cause a net increase in carbon emissions due to the fact that their generating intermittency means they must be &quot;backed-up&quot; with gas-fired generation. The claim seems to have originated from a Dutch wind critic and retired physicist called Kees le Pair who posted a non-peer reviewed paper on his website last October. The claim was then picked up and disseminated by, among others, the right-leaning thinktank Civitas. Le Pair based his claim on an theorised scenario featuring a hypothetical 300MW windfarm near Schiphol airport. He said his analysis showed that, even on a windy day, a gas-fired power plant would need to be switched on and off - an inefficient process - throughout the day to cover the farm&apos;s generating intermittency. This, he claimed, would cause a net increase in carbon emissions because it would be more efficient to just have a modern gas-fired power plant do all the generating. But this claim has since been widely rebuffed. In January, Robert Gross, director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College, London, told the Guardian: &quot;Extreme estimates usually result from flawed or overly simplistic methodologies, unrealistic assumptions, or misallocation of costs. UKERC undertook a thoroughgoing review of the evidence base available in 2006 on the costs and impacts of intermittency ... Electrical engineering based modelling and simulation, and increasingly empirical data from countries where the penetration of windfarms has reached a significant level (such as Ireland, Denmark, Spain, Germany and some US states), demonstrates conclusively that wind does reduce emissions.&quot;",

    "text": "Over the coming months, gender violence  ways to tackle it and prevent it  will be a topic of high-level discussion. The UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), which meets in March, will be focusing on eliminating violence against women and girls, while a priority of the British government as chair of the G8 when it meets in June is to address sexual violence in conflict. Highlighting the issue, Mark Tran recently travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he spoke to a young woman who was raped during fighting, and a child soldier from a militia group, who has raped women. Meanwhile, Glenys Kinnock argued that the US aid ban on abortions for women raped in war had repercussions for the UK, something that will need to be considered by the foreign office&apos;s new sexual violence in conflict initiative. To mark the build-up to the CSW, we&apos;re interested to hear what is already being done to address the issue. Who inspires you with their work to tackle gender violence. Send us a photo of your message. Be creative. Write a message on a postcard. Create of picture of your hero and upload it to Flickr, Twitter or Instagram and tag the photos #globaldevwomen. We&apos;ll display some of the best ones on the Global development site over the coming weeks. Our February Global development podcast, launched later this week, will also be exploring gender violence. Student resources We&apos;ve revamped our student pages, which we hope will make it easier to explore our resources, blogs, data sets and interactives, plus the latest news and features. Find out how you can join our community, contribute to debate, and suggest discussion topics for the year ahead. For more information, email our community co-ordinator Maeve Shearlaw. Elsewhere on the site John Vidal travelled to a village in India&apos;s poorest state, Bihar, where farmers are growing world record amounts of rice, with no GM or herbicide, raising the prospect of a possible solution to the world&apos;s food shortages. Norman Uphoff, professor at Cornell University, explains how it is being done. We report on research published by Save the Children that manufacturers of breast milk substitutes are targeting mothers and health professionals with free gifts and samples, in violation of international codes of practice. As David Cameron visits India, we report on how the UK&apos;s decision to end aid to the country has divided opinion. Meanwhile, the head of UN humanitarian operations, Baroness Amos, tells Mark Tran that not enough help is reaching refugees and displaced people in Syria. Coming up Claire Provost interviews Jin-Yong Cai, the new CEO of the International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank group, about his future ambitions. Mark Tran speaks to Vandana Shiva, who explains why seeds must be in the hands of the farmers, not big business. And we report on the solar power scheme that is lighting up Indian villages. We&apos;ll also be reporting from the CSW in New York from the beginning of March. Multimedia In pictures: Suffering and survival  A decade of women in Africa UK NGO SafeHands for Mothers was set up 10 years ago to campaign for better maternal and newborn health across the world using photography and film-making. In photos mainly from east Africa, Nancy Durrell McKenna tells stories of women suffering after female genital mutilation, coping with childbirth, and living  and sometimes thriving  with HIV. In pictures: Why does Chad have so many stunted and malnourished children? More than half of all children in Chad are stunted, one of the highest rates in the world, according to Unicef. Stunting is the result of having too few calories, too little variety of food, or both. The problem is growing due to unpredictable weather patterns that play havoc with food production in the food-insecure country. The devastating effect of stunted growth is illustrated in these images from the Mao region of Chad. What you said: some of the best reader comments On Jonathan Glennie&apos;s blog on why poor people have got a right to be angry, howmatters wrote:  Mr Glennie rightly points out just how pressing it is to revive and magnify empathy within international development and foreign assistance in the 21st century. Within the sector, too much is being lost in the abstraction and over-technicalisation of this work.  On John Vidal&apos;s feature on India&apos;s rice revolution, Thrinax said:  Farming has always been about farmers. Over the years  all over the world  farmers have generally been ... um.... seduced by agribusiness. It&apos;s a tough life being a farmer. I am one. And it&apos;s like everything else in life. If there&apos;s something available to make our lives easier  we take it. Just like everyone else. It&apos;s increasingly obvious to some of us (eg  some of the farmers in Bihar) that what we need to do is consider better approached [approaches] to what we have always done  for thousands of years. Return to being farmers.  On Afua Hirsch&apos;s report on the launch of Ghana&apos;s first maternal health channel, JaneRoberts wrote:  Radio and TV drama are very effective at disseminating information and improving access to reproductive and other types of healthcare.  Highlights from the blogosphere After the shock resignation of Pope Benedict last week, debate quickly turned to who could replace him  and whether the next pope should be African. Think Africa Press profiled the frontrunners from Ghana and Nigeria, while a post on Democracy and Development argued why a pope from a poorer country &quot;could bring a more tangible understanding of the critical importance of the church&apos;s on-the-ground anti-poverty and development work&quot;. On the World Bank&apos;s Africa Can End Poverty blog, Tom Bundervoet explored the opportunities and the challenges Rwanda faces in coping with a future bulge in working-age young people. Jenny Ottenhoff, from the Centre for Global Development, analysed President Obama&apos;s state of the union address last week and was encouraged by comments on climate change and efforts to link development to the domestic policies. And finally  Poverty matters will return in two weeks with another roundup of the latest news and comment. In the meantime, keep up to date on the Global development website.

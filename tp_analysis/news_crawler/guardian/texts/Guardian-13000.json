    "text": "For years, the Metal Gear series has focused on methodical stealth action and restrained gunplay. But with Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, a new creative team is at the helm, and as a result the series has taken a confident new direction. Platinum Games has moulded Metal Gear into an intense roaming brawler where the player must explore vast levels at high speed, all the while engaging in acrobatic melee combat. Rising&apos;s world is one of a near future where cyborg guns for hire are players in an elaborate thriller, with the narrative running the gamut from ethics to film theory. Metal Gear Rising is as fun as it is fast. Cut scenes switch from sober to silly with delightful effect and the action is spectacular to the point of inspired absurdity. It is also, it must be said, difficult and rarely panders to the player. Weakest when apeing the stealth that has defined Metal Gear games, Rising is otherwise a superb playground for anyone thirsting for action.",

    "text": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Oink&apos;s data privacy breach: download the data of any user with their own export tool &gt;&gt; Critina Cordova  When Oink shut down yesterday, I used their export tool so that I could do something useful with the information I gave them. In requesting my data, which I did simply by filling out a form with only my username, I received the email below. In looking at the link, it seemed that my publicly available username (cristina) called for the download.  It had, and she could then change to Kevin Rose&apos;s username and download *his* data. (Oink later fixed it.) Rose and the Oink team are going to Google. (Not to be confused with the UK&apos;s OiNK.) Rumor: Nexus tablet is a &quot;done deal&quot;, to retail for as low as $149 &gt;&gt; Android and Me  The ASUS MeMo 370T that was revealed at CES has been scrapped after Google contracted with ASUS to produce their &quot;Nexus tablet&quot;. Earlier reports said the device would retail for $249-199, but we are now told the target price is $149-199. The quad-core Tegra 3 version that was previously leaked is no more. Other than the 7in display, no additional information has been provided on the specs.  At the time, AndroidAndMe said the Memo 370T &quot;could be a Kindle killer&quot;.  Mountain Lion now protects your contacts &gt;&gt; Dustin Curtis  Before Mountain Lion Developer Preview 2, Mac apps could access your contacts at any time, without asking for permission. You wouldn&apos;t even know it was happening. This policy is the same as the one on iOS, which recently got a lot of attention. Today&apos;s release of DP 2 removes that ability by default.  What&apos;s the position on Windows 8, Developer or Consumer betas? Viviane Reding responds to Reporters Without Borders&apos; criticism of &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; &gt;&gt; Reporters Without Borders  The right to be forgotten is not an absolute right. The proposed Regulation, which the European Commission adopted on 25 January 2012, provides for very broad exemptions to ensure that freedom of expression can be fully taken into account. This will allow, for instance, news websites to continue to operate on the basis of the same principles.  And so it moves on. The Towson Hack: The mystery of vanishing iTunes credit &gt;&gt; Macworld September 2011, but possibly still going on:   Many customers whose store credit was stolen noted that the purchases centered on a handful of apps from specific developers. One of those developers was &quot;gao jing,&quot; the name behind apps like Expert Guide for Black Ops, Cheats Guide for Black Ops, Weapons Guide for Black Ops, and Game Guide for New Vegas. Notably, none of those apps remain in the App Store as of this writing; however, Apple declined to comment on the reason for their removal from the store. Other customers noted that the purchased apps on their accounts were all from other developers, including &quot;Hongbin Suo,&quot; &quot;lane ma,&quot; &quot;Yang Yun,&quot; &quot;KAMAGAMES,&quot; and &quot;Lakoo.&quot; Many of the purchased apps, or the companies behind them, appeared to be Chinese in origin.  Text advertising blindness: the new banner blindness? &gt;&gt; International Journal of Usability Studies From May 2011:   Practitioners should realize the following about text advertisements: Users demonstrate text advertisement &quot;blindness&quot; when viewing web pages. This means that information displayed in areas of the page dedicated to text ads (e.g., top of the page, right side) is generally ignored or viewed last.Users are less likely to find information on a web page if it is located on the right side of the page than on the top of the page if both areas resemble text ads. This is especially true when they are searching for specific information. When conducting an informational, or semantic, search, users have equal amount of difficulty finding information that is embedded in an ad either at the top or on the right side of the page.  There&apos;s more, equally interesting.  40% of US government Web sites fail security test &gt;&gt; Network World  Approximately 40% of federal government agencies are out of compliance with a regulation that requires them to deploy an extra layer of authentication on their Web sites to prevent hackers from hijacking Web traffic and redirecting it to bogus sites. It&apos;s been more than two years since federal agencies were required to support DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) on their Web sites. However, two recent studies indicate that around 40% of federal Web sites have not yet deployed this Internet security standard.  Faintly depressing. Microsoft said to plan debut of new Xbox in 2013 at earliest &gt;&gt; Bloomberg  Microsoft will release the next version of its Xbox console in 2013 at the earliest, as the company squeezes at least one more year of sales out of its current model, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The company may show the successor to its Xbox 360 in June 2013 at the E3 conference and put it on sale that same year, said the people, who declined to be named because the plans are confidential. David Dennis, a company spokesman, said earlier today that Microsoft won&apos;t discuss new Xbox hardware at this year&apos;s E3, quelling speculation that the device would be unveiled at the 2012 show.

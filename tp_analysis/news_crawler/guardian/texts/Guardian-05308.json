    "text": "While it is commendable that Rada auditions every applicant for its acting training (In a class of their own, G2, 7 March), it is not a wholly philanthropic gesture. Acting schools charge an audition fee and auditioning several thousand people each year must bring in a considerable sum. All such schools do the same, as my son found when he was auditioning, some charging 40 for a 10-minute audition. Thankfully, my wife and I were in a position to pay not only the fees but also travel and accommodation costs, and he secured a place. We&apos;re not rich but made sacrifices to support him  I wonder how many potential actors have been lost because parents could not find the funds. My wife teaches English and drama at a state secondary school  in complete contrast to the resources available at Eton, she struggles to find money for the camera required to film GCSE assessed performances.Name and address supplied",

    "text": "Last week, MPs debated plans for a new groceries code adjudicator , destined to be known as the &quot;supermarket watchdog&quot;. Will it be enough to curb the power of the supermarkets? There&apos;s been a strong push from campaigners for the adjudicator to have more teeth, and the Lib Dem farming minister, David Heath, has said the government is prepared to listen. But then we&apos;ve heard many similar promises from Liberal Democrat ministers in this government before. And the fact that the government has gone for an adjudicator rather than the original proposal for a more proactive ombudsman  and shows no signs of going back on that  doesn&apos;t inspire much hope. Despite Heath&apos;s warm words, as the bill currently stands, the power to fine supermarkets will be implemented only if the government decides that its preferred option  naming and shaming supermarkets which unfairly use their market power against suppliers  isn&apos;t working. There are also issues around only suppliers being able to report cases to the adjudicator: what then for a campaigning group with evidence of workers being mistreated by a developing-world supplier? Grocery sales in Britain were worth more than 143bn in 2009, and large grocers  those with a turnover of more than 1bn a year  account for about 85% of the total, with Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury&apos;s and Tesco taking two-thirds of that mighty swag. Proper regulation of these companies matters to all of us. It matters for consumers because the level of genuine competition, when more and more small local shops are forced out by the giants, can only fall. And contrary to popular advertising-driven opinion, the supermarkets aren&apos;t necessarily the cheapest shopping option. That&apos;s even without mentioning their sometimes dubious marketing practices. It also matters in terms of jobs. The British Retail Planning Forum calculated in 1998 that, on average, the opening of a single large supermarket results in the net loss of 276 jobs. Meanwhile, the Face the Difference report from the Fair Pay Network showed that none of the major supermarkets have seen fit to implement living wage policies for their lowest-paid staff, even though remuneration packages for top executives continue to run into millions of pounds. Finally, it matters to our environment. First, because supermarkets build their systems around shipping food long distances around the country, using practices that result in vast amounts of waste  as the Guardian reported in the grave case of Prince Charles&apos; carrots . As supermarkets spread around the country, they strangle what the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England has called local food webs. As supermarkets tend to favour big suppliers  factory farms and large acreage monocultures over smaller and more diverse suppliers  they help to create conditions where the economics for the latter just can&apos;t stack up. In recent years, supermarkets have been making big noises about mending their ways, treating their suppliers  particularly the smaller ones  more fairly. Unfortunately, there&apos;s more than enough cause to doubt these claims. Just consider the struggle dairy farmers had recently to get a price for their milk that even covered their cost of production. So unless we give this adjudicator real teeth, it&apos;s difficult to see how positive change is going to happen. It&apos;s something I saw first-hand as a teenager working for a hardware wholesaler who was successfully selling into big superstores  so successfully that he nearly went broke every month. He was on 30-day payment terms with his suppliers, but the big chains would only offer him 60 days (in theory; that more often stretched to 90 days). Every month they ordered more goods from him and every month he had to scrabble around to find the cash. And at least he wasn&apos;t selling perishable goods, which are at the mercy of subjective quality judgments  as farmers and food manufacturers are. More recently, I&apos;ve seen first-hand what an alternative model might look like. I&apos;m a member of The People&apos;s Supermarket in London, a small co-operative which uses as much as possible small local suppliers  for example, one potato farmer in Kent in season, one potato and pepper grower in Essex. It makes ready meals on site from food approaching its use-by date, greatly cutting waste. This is the kind of food model I think we need in order to build more resilient, sustainable, and low-carbon food supplies. We don&apos;t want supermarkets wringing the last drops of profits from the blood of their struggling suppliers and their underpaid workers  all to bring us perfectly shaped globes of tasteless, over-processed monocultures, rather than tasty, fresh and local fruit and vegetables.",

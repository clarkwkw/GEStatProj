Trevor Rowe, a spokesperson from Engie, told Guardian Australia on Monday that no decision regarding the future of Hazelwood was imminent.  He dismissed the reports of a closure as another burst of speculation. There has been so much speculation and rumours over the last 12 months to two years, he said. Were used to it. Engie and Mitsui would be legally required to dismantle the plant and rehabilitate the site if it closes, a task which has previously been estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Les Echos reported that several sources claim the sum would be closer to 1bn (AU$1.43bn).  Environmental organisations say the plant  which has a generating capacity of 1.5 gigawatts, accounting for 5.4% of Australias electricity supplies  is one of the most polluting power stations in the world. Engies chief executive, Isabelle Kocher, told a French senate committee in May that the utility planned a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired power generation and that it would look at either selling or closing Hazelwood.  For the Hazelwood plant, we are studying all possible scenarios, including closure, or a sale if the state of Victoria tells us that it cannot meet power-generating needs without this plant, Kocher said.

Engies Australian unit was charged in court in February with failing to provide a safe workplace and ensure public safety over the fire. Engie (formerly GDF Suez) acquired a majority stake in Hazelwood when it bought UK utility International Power in 2012 and currently owns 72% with Japanese group Mitsui &amp; Co holding the remaining 28%.

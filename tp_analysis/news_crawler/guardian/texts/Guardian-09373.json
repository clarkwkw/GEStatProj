    "text": "Subject: history Interviewer: Stephen Tuck, Pembroke College  Q: Imagine we had no records about the past at all, except everything to do with sport  how much of the past could we find out about? Stephen: I would say this to a candidate who had mentioned an interest in sport on their personal statement, though it could equally be applied to an interest in something else  like film, drama, or music. What I would be looking for is to see how the candidate might use their imagination, building on something they know about (probably much more than I do) to tackle questions of historical research. Answers could relate to the racial/class/gender relations in society (who played the sports, and which sports, at any given time); international politics/empire (which countries were involved, did groups of countries play the same sport); economic development (the technological development of sports, how sport was watched); the values within a society (bloodthirsty sports to more genteel sports); health (participation rates); or many other issues  the list is long. I would usually ask supplementary questions, to push the students further  and often, I would have no answer in my mind, but would simply be interested in seeing how far the student could push their analysis. Subject: English Interviewer: Lucinda Rumsey, Mansfield College  Q: JK Rowling has just published a book for adults after the hugely successful Harry Potter series. In what ways do you think that writing for children is different to writing for adults? Lucinda: Candidates who have grown up on Harry Potter might have read Rowling&apos;s new book and have thought both about Rowling&apos;s change of audience and their own change as readers from child to adult. But even without knowing Rowling&apos;s work at all candidates could say something about themselves as readers, and how as readers they approach different kinds of books, and how writers develop a body of work and write for different audiences. Mainly I always want to know that whatever they are reading, candidates are reading thoughtfully and self-consciously, and are able to think as literary critics about all the books they read. I worry that not all candidates might have the same access to a wide range of literature, and I am careful to judge them on what they know, not on what they don&apos;t know. If I asked that question about Shakespeare some candidates might have a view of his literary output, but many wouldn&apos;t. If I start with Harry Potter, everyone at least has a starting point of recognition. And I think Rowling deserves a mention as I am sure that there are many people applying to study English at university this year who became avid readers because of her books. Subject: experimental psychology Interviewer: David Popplewell, Brasenose College  Q: Why do human beings have two eyes? David: This question may result from a more general discussion about the human senses, and can develop in a number of different directions, partly depending upon the knowledge and expertise of the interviewee. For example, two eyes are important for three dimensional (3D) vision. Why is it that we can still see in 3D when only looking through one eye? What determines the optimum position and distance between the two eyes? Why is it that we see a stable view of the world even though we are constantly moving our head? How can an understanding of mathematics, physics and biology help us explain 3D vision? The discussion may develop in to a consideration of the different senses and the role they play in us interacting in our environment, including interacting with other people, and the nature of perceptual experience. Subject: modern languages Interviewer: Helen Swift, St Hilda&apos;s College Q: Should poetry be difficult to understand? Helen: This question arose out of discussion of a few poems that a candidate said he had read, and we were talking through how these poems were conveying meaning (through things such as tone and the imagery they used). We wanted to push the candidate into more conceptual thinking to test his intellectual curiosity and how he would handle moving from familiar particulars (the poems he knew) to less familiar ways of approaching them. What&apos;s important for candidates to realise is that we don&apos;t expect a single correct answer to such a question; it&apos;s a starting point for a new direction of discussion: what sorts of &quot;difficulties&quot; might we have in mind? Are these specific to poetry or do they also feature in other types of writing? And so on. What most interests us is that candidates are willing to venture down a new path, however uncertain this may feel: to have a go and show that they have the potential to develop their thinking further  and thus thrive on the sort of course we offer. Literature forms an important part of a modern languages degree at Oxford, but we know that most candidates won&apos;t have studied literature formally before in the language for which they&apos;re applying. What we want to know isn&apos;t that they&apos;ve read a certain number of texts to prove their interest, but that they have the aptitude for studying texts: that they&apos;re able to think carefully and imaginatively about whatever they&apos;ve have chance to read (poems, prose, drama) that&apos;s interested them, in any language. Subject: biological sciences Interviewer: Martin Speight, St Anne&apos;s College Q: Why do many animals have stripes? Martin: The main aim of the question is to get applicants to think about biological topics and put them in the context of successful adaptations to life on earth. So I might expect students to start by thinking of some stripey animals, then move on to thinking about categories of striped animals  for example those that are dangerous (such as wasps, tigers, and snakes), those that have stripes for camouflage (such as zebras but also tigers), and those whose stripes are harmless mimics of dangerous ones. They might think of specific examples for detailed comparison: tigers and zebras for example both have stripes for camouflage and blending in with background, one to hide from prey and the other to hide from predators. Other things that would be worth considering include whether stripes may only occur in the young of a species; whether the colour of the stripes matters rather than just the contrasting stripe pattern, and why do stripe size, shape, width and pattern vary in different species. There are no right or wrong specific answers to the questions  I&apos;m just interested in candidates&apos; speculations about the advantages of having stripes. Subject: politics (philosophy, politics and economics)Interviewer: Dave Leal, Brasenose College  Q: When I was at school in the 1970s, there was talk of a pensions crisis that would one day hit. The talk persisted in the 1980s, and the 1990s  and then there was a pensions crisis, and little had been done politically to prepare us for it. Is there a fault with the British political system that means we can&apos;t sensibly address serious medium and long-term problems when they are identified? Dave: This question was an invitation to think about democracy and its limitations  it&apos;s a big question, but an important one. I have had candidates come up with good discussions about voting methods  for example, how having proportions of parliament voted in for much longer terms might promote more long-term policy thinking. Another approach might be to reflect on the responsibility of the electorate; if they do not think in long-term ways, it may not be politicians who are to blame, and the problem may be down to education. One might reflect upon the importance of having an un-elected second chamber to which all really important business could be delegated. One candidate suggested that no one should be allowed to stand for parliament unless they have dependent children, with the thought that this would ensure a personal motivation towards longer term thinking on a variety of matters. There is no single &apos;right answer&apos; to the question, most answers given serve as the basis for further elaboration. For example, in the case of longer parliamentary terms: what would be the wider consequences of that change? Would they be desirable? We are testing the capacity to begin to locate the source of a problem, and try out solutions through discussion. The precise solution students suggest matters much less than evidence of the refining of ideas and of self-correction where necessary.   Do you have memories of a nerve-racking university interview?

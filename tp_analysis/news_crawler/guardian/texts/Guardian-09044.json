    "text": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team The Forgotten Mapmaker: Nokia has better maps than Apple and maybe even Google &gt;&gt; The Atlantic Alexis Madrigal:   Nokia is the company that receives the GPS data from both FedEx and UPS, the company&apos;s senior VP of Location Content, Cliff Fox, told me.  &quot;We get over 12 billion probe data points per month coming into the organization,&quot; Fox said from his office in Chicago. &quot;We get probe data not only from commercial vehicles like FedEx and UPS trucks, but we also get it from consumers through navigation applications.&quot;   Depending on the device type, the data that streams into Nokia can have slight variations.  &quot;The system that they have for tracking the UPS trucks is different from the way the maps application works on the Nokia device. You&apos;ll have differences on the amount of times per minute they ping their location, though typically it&apos;s every 5 to 15 seconds,&quot; Fox said. &quot;It&apos;ll give you a location, a direction, and a speed as well.&quot;  They can then use that data to identify new or changed roads. In 2012, they&apos;ve used the GPS data they get to identify 65,000 road segments. (A road segment is defined as the strip of surface between intersecting roads.) The GPS data also comes in handy when they&apos;re building traffic maps because they know the velocity of the vehicles.   Read on for the clever privacy protection tweak too. And yes, Nokia&apos;s Navteq does operate Streetview-style cars. TomTom navigation finally arrives on Android, but lacks compatibility with popular devices &gt;&gt; The Verge  The apps are available from Google Play now, although device compatibility isn&apos;t perfect: many of our devices -- including the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7, HTC One X, Galaxy S III, and Galaxy Note -- are listed as incompatible in our Google Play account, and we&apos;re sure that list will grow as more users attempt to buy the app.   Limited at present to devices with 800x480 or 854x480 screens. Although why would you want a TomTom app if you&apos;re on Android? Five reasons location is the smartphone&apos;s killer map &gt;&gt; Fast Company  Are you sitting somewhere comfy? Because right at this moment, your smartphone is likely calculating and then sharing your seated location. But don&apos;t worry: You are far from alone. Location-sharing services are on the rise. Here, the big reasons for the trend in personal placement.  Pirates (PPI) blocked from becoming observer member of WIPO &gt;&gt; PirateTimes  In its General Assembly meeting of October, 3, 2012, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has chosen to wait until 2013 to take a decision on the observer membership application of the PPI. Torn between the recent evidences of the Pirate Parties influence in several national elections and the objections of several of its member states, the UN agency chose to take no side and wait for a future ruling about political parties&apos; applications.   Very politically playing for time in the hope the Pirate Party will go away. We&apos;ll see who rusts first. HP smartphone not coming in 2013, says CEO Meg Whitman &gt;&gt; ComputerworldUK.com  HP has no plans to launch a smartphone next year but will need to sell one eventually to avoid missing out on &quot;a huge segment of the population,&quot; CEO Meg Whitman said yesterday.   Such as the 50% in the US and UK who already have one, and where smartphones are 80% of handset sales? Any time, Ms Whitman. If only HP had owned a smartphone division.. pardon? Motorola dumps three 4G phones from Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade list &gt;&gt; TechHive  Google-owned phone maker Motorola Mobility has quietly backed off its decision to upgrade three of its 4G phones to Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) including the Atrix 4G, Photon 4G, and Electrify. Instead, the three phones will stay on Android 2.3 Gingerbread and receive maintenance upgrades. Motorola in February had listed the phones as slated for an Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade between July and September.   And owners of the Atrix and Photon had an update pushed out which locked the bootloader, apparently, so they can&apos;t load a custom ROM. Jim Cramer: HP is the next Kodak &gt;&gt; TheStreet Video. Just the headline is scary enough. Facebook: The making of 1 billion users &gt;&gt; Businessweek  The team in charge of tracking Facebook&apos;s (FB) growth works on the second floor of Building 17. Most days, the offices are like anywhere else at Facebook: whiteboards, toys on desks, shorts and flip-flops, pretty low-key. Around noon on Sept. 14, the second floor was packed. In one of the common areas, a giant screen showed the number of active Facebook users worldwide. About 100 people, including Mark Zuckerberg and his top lieutenants, watched the numbers run up by about a thousand users per minute: 999,980,000 ... 999,990,000 ... 1,000,000,000. The counter paused for a moment when it rounded 10 digits, as if to emphasize the point: 1 billion users.   So Facebook actually hit that target on 14 September? AAPL: iPhone 5?s Amazing 93% Margin on NAND, Per RBC &gt;&gt; Barrons.com Doug Freedman of brokers RBC Capital:   We were surprised to see Apple continue to charge $100 for each incremental 16GB of NAND, given that AMZN is charging $50 (Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; and Kindle Fire HD 9&quot; LTE) to $70 (Kindle Fire HD 9&quot; WiFi) for each 16GB of NAND. We estimate that Apple is able to procure NAND flash for ~$0.42 per GB (at market prices or better), while reselling for $6.25 per GB (calculated as $100 for each 16GB of step-up). This implies a favorable 93% gross margin on NAND.   Wonky calculation (going from the 32GB to 64GB model only adds $100) and the procurement price actually seems pretty high - not far from retail. ($42 for 100GB is about wholesale price for an SSD; you&apos;d think Apple could do better.) Is the search for profit the reason why Apple doesn&apos;t offer an expansion slot? Though nor, come to that, does the Google Galaxy Nexus. Or HTC One X. Or Nokia Lumia models. By contrasat, Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S3 does offer SD expansion. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.) Too much of a good thing? How HP made a mockery of Envy &gt;&gt; Digital Trends  I was browsing the aisle of my least hated computer hardware retailer when I saw it: Sleek. Black. Chrome. It was...an HP Envy printer.  Did my eyes deceive me? They did not. As I walked closer, I saw that the Envy signage on the boxes below the printer matched that on the printer itself. It was true. HP had developed an Envy printer and put it out to the public.  That&apos;s the exact moment I knew the Envy sub-brand had jumped the shark.   Envy was an outgrowth of HP&apos;s acquisition of gaming PC company Voodoo; now it is being applied to everything, to no good effect. You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

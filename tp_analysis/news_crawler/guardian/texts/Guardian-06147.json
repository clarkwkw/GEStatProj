    "text": "The river Stour makes a natural moat round two sides of Marnhull, which is one of a string of villages up on a limestone ridge, high and dry above the meadows, marsh and reed beds of the vale through which the river winds. To get to Marnhull we must cross one of two bridges, either the grand King&apos;s Mill Bridge (with picturesque mill and millpond and its warning of transportation for life if you wilfully injure any part of it) or a humbler bridge by a weir to the north-west. Whichever we take, it is hard to know when we have really arrived, as Marnhull is a scattered village or collection of linked hamlets, the fine and ancient church with its impressive tower being set on a high point at one corner. The place is given its own coherence and character by the pale cream stone from local quarries seen in the church, the ancient farm next to it, and the cottages and fine 17th- and 18th-century houses that you come upon round the twists and corners of the lanes. A plaque beside a gateway directed us uphill to the recreation ground, secured in perpetuity for his native village by one John Warren. It is an open stretch of well-mown grass, high up and commanding views across the plain, especially eastwards towards the wooded mound of Duncliffe and the hill town of Shaftesbury. To the south, over the rooftops and trees, I could see the church tower against the sky, while close by, just beyond the busy children&apos;splayground, a meadow was knee-deep in wild flowers. But in the middle of the ground, local bowlers were troubling the batsmen of a visiting 11 from near Bournemouth, who, in the fourth over, had already lost three wickets for eight runs. And the next man to bat, shirt off, sunning his already deep bronze torso as he buckled on his pads, shook his head. He said he lacked confidence. The pitch was low and slow and not to his liking.",

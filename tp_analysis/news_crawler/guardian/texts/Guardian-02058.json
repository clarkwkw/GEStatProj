    "text": "Ubisoft has announced the first details of forthcoming action adventure sequel, Assassin&apos;s Creed III. The third title in the publisher&apos;s hit series is set to take place during the American Revolution. No screenshots have been released, although the box art has been revealed, showing an unnamed assassin character battling with a downed Red Coat soldier. It seems that the war between the assassins and the Templars has moved on from the Renaissance setting of Assassin&apos;s Creed II, to the New World. US magazine Game Informer has an exclusive feature on the game. Its cover shows the character carrying a pistol and a tomahawk, whch may suggest a Native American aspect to the plot.  The Assassin&apos;s Creed series has been a huge success for Ubisoft, selling over 30 million units since the first title, set during the Crusades.  Nothing else is known at present, although Ubisoft is promising to announce all the details at 5pm on 5 March. The game is expected to release on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 this winter. So, the American Revolution then  what do you Assassin&apos;s fans think about that?",

    "text": "If you are not a games industry insider or a very committed player you may have missed a rather damaging controversy last week. It started when journalists attending this month&apos;s Games Media Awards were given the chance to win a PS3 by tweeting about a certain game and including its hashtag in their message. I didn&apos;t do it because I felt it was tantamount amount to a sponsored tweet, a form of advertising that the Guardian would not permit, but the fact that some attendees did enter the competition angered a lot of industry watchers. Shortly afterwards, the TV comedian and Eurogamer columnist Robert Florence wrote a damning article calling into question the increasingly close relationship between games journalists and games publishers. Later, certain elements of this scathing diatribe were removed due to complaints made by a writer criticised in the text, and Florence announced that he would no longer be contributing to the site. A fireball of invective and criticismthen consumed industry Twitter communications for the next three days. Veteran games writer Stuart Campbell has provided a lengthy timeline of the controversy here, and Robert Florence has written a response to the ensuing Twitter storm on  the personal site of John Walker, the editor of PC gaming site, Rock Paper Shotgun. It has, in short, been a difficult and depressing week for games journalism. Accusations and insults have been chucked around and the impartiality of games news sources, which rely heavily on workingrelationships with publishers, has been brought into question. It seems there are a lot of gamers who believe that games writers are little better than PR shills, trading favourable features and reviews for exclusive access to new titles or juicy freebies. Certainly, as in all forms of entertainment writing, there is close and regular interaction between the journalists and the PR departments of the major content providers. Access to preview and review material is now tightly controlled in this industry. This is partly because the threat of software piracy is ever present and terrifying to companies that have spent millions of dollars and countless working hours to produce Triple A titles. But it&apos;s also because publishers want to engineer an environment in which their products are viewed and discussed favourably. Getting access to new games now involves a relationship between journalist and producer, an understanding that there are two motives being uneasily aligned. We must now consider this properly. The situation is far from perfect, it involves compromise, and yet somehow it is the way entertainment writing works  especially in the digital era. Some might also draw a distinction here between entertainment writing and news journalism. Very few games writers indulge in the popularly accepted definition of &quot;journalism&quot;  an investigative procedure in which the aim is exposure. As William Randolph Hearst famously wrote, &quot;news is something somebody doesn&apos;t want printed; all else is advertising&quot;.  There is truth in that, of course. But it is also true that entertainment writing is about providing people with the information they want on things they love  like games, movies and music. The best entertainment writers do more than that  they analyse and interpret the industry; they provide context and draw interesting conclusions; they add depth and soul to the experience of learning about new things. Standards of quality must be the same. However, writing about games can be fraught with difficulties and ambiguities. The increasing cost of producing games has made publishers more guarded and controlling. At the same time, the rise of blogging culture has created a scene in which games journalism and fan content co-exist and combine. There are major debates going on about what journalism should mean in the digital era  there are arguments that it is mutating into aggregation. Alan Rusbridger&apos;s concept of open journalism suggests that some stories are best explored in partnership with bloggers and other participants outside of mainstream journalism. New frameworks have to be established in this complex arena; we also need to set clear standards if we work in partnership with bloggers too. I have been a games writer for 18 years, and I have seen many changes in the industry. Today, the job I do involves a lot of communication with the PR departments of major publishers  so ultimately it is up to myself to consider the boundaries within the context of the Guardian&apos;s overall code. I have thought a lot about my role in the last week while watching this controversy unfold and it has made me ask serious questions. From a personal and professional standpoint, I put the reader first in everything I write or commission  this is sacrosanct. Games writing might not be as &quot;important&quot; as other areas of the news media, but it must be carried out with integrity. I also believe that most PR professionals are helpful individuals, playing and promoting games they adore. However, during a period in which the credibility and impartiality of games writers is being questioned, it&apos;s worth reiterating or spelling out how games are covered on this site, and how I wish to increase transparency. ALL articles resulting from hosted press trips and events will be flagged as such. This practice is common throughout the Guardian and it forms part of the newspaper&apos;s code of conduct. Press trips are a very useful element of games writing and they can result in fantastic and interesting articles  they allow unique access to the people who develop the content. But it is important for readers to know when something they are reading is the direct result of a trip or event funded by a publisher.  I will no longer commission reviews based on publisher-organised events. Often major publishers, rightfully fearful of their game code slipping into the wrong hands and being pirated before release, will hold special review events. This is really specific to the games industry, at least to the best of my knowledge. Journalists are invited to attend and can play forthcoming titles, usually for a couple of days, without distraction. They&apos;re convenient, well-managed and well-intentioned, but they also limit the reviewer&apos;s time with the game and can be perceived by some as a questionable form of collaboration between publisher and critic. Non-attendance at such events will mean that we sometimes provide our reviews later than other sources. I think it&apos;s worth it. The last week has been depressing and damaging, but it should not end with games writers closing ranks and denying that there are ambiguities and dilemmas that must be addressed. The best outcome would be for all of us, including myself, to rethink how we engage with and report on this magnificent and powerful medium.

    "text": "The ISS (International Space Station) with its crew of six is conspicuous in our evening sky again as it soars eastwards some 423km above S England. Don&apos;t mistake it, though, for the Jupiter which blazes high in the S at nightfall. As its orbit shifts westwards, we lose the ISS in the twilight before the month ends, only for it to reappear before dawn on March 18 or so. Our predictions of its best transits over the coming week use asterisks to flag the directions in which disappears into the Earth&apos;s shadow. I have taken account of a small boost to its orbit planned for next Friday, but other small orbital changes may occur with little notice, perhaps throwing the times out by a minute or more.

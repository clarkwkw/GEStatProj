    "text": "Welcome to Guardian Students. Now you have your own home on the Guardian website to focus on the questions that concern you:  Should I be studying or trying to find a job?  Are admissions tutors going to look at my facebook page?  Which universities do employers rate most highly?  How can I stay fit if I&apos;m writing essays every waking hour?  I&apos;m an international student - what&apos;s spotted dick? Being a student has never been as complicated as it is right now. Take fees. They&apos;ve shot up to around 9,000 at most universities, with a system of repayment that you&apos;d need a degree to understand. There are cut-price courses on offer at some newer universities and further education colleges. Private universities have popped up, widening the range of choices still further. And have you noticed how many people are opting to study abroad? Then there&apos;s the state of the jobs market. Youth unemployment is at record levels and a quarter of graduates found themselves out of work last year. Many of you are looking at the university option and asking: is this really the best path to a future career? Guardian Students will offer up-to-the-minute advice and a place for students to talk things through.  There&apos;ll be live chat with experts to help you choose a course and nail a place on it.  Guardian journalists will keep you informed of all the latest news and policy changes that could have an impact on your lives.  Blogging Students, our new discussion forum, is already drawing record numbers of readers who are talking about everything from drugs to Twitter, anxiety to student clubs, exams to internships. We&apos;re uncovering some first-rate student writing talent, and you might like to be part of that.  We&apos;ll be covering student cooking, budgeting, housing, transport, travel, nightlife and jobs.  Our competitions will have seriously useful prizes - including the chance of work experience on Guardian Students. And best of all, Guardian Students hosts the all-new Guardian University Guide for 2013. It ranks every university in the country according to the Guardian&apos;s unique formula that takes into account student satisfaction, how many students get jobs after their courses and how much students improve during their time at university. Our guide features profiles of every university in the country, with the latest details of fees and bursaries, and an insight into what the student experience is like at each institution. And we also have details of every subject on offer in higher education, so you&apos;ll know exactly what you&apos;re getting when you pick a course.

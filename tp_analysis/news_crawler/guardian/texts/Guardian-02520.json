    "headline": "Guardian Higher Education Summit: 'We have to take changes on the chin'", 
    "text": "Maybe it was the aftermath of the seismic changes that have hit universities in recent months, maybe it was the eye of the storm, but a strange calm suffused the Guardian&apos;s sixth Higher Education Summit in London last week. At last year&apos;s event, institutions had just learned that university budgets would be slashed and were working out how much they could charge students to help make up the difference. Access agreements were still to be signed showing how institutions planned to broaden their pool of applicants. And the &quot;core and margin&quot; idea, whereby universities can recruit as many students with top A-level grades as they like and bid for more students if they charge lower fees, was barely a twinkle in the eye of the universities minister, David Willetts. Addressing this year&apos;s summit, the shadow minister for higher education, Shabana Mahmood, questioned the wisdom of this pace of change to a system that was fundamentally successful and warned of potential damage to its global reputation. But delegates seemed resigned to the fact that their sector would soon look radically different. While many would not have chosen the route taken by policymakers, the recent revolution in higher education funding and teaching would make institutions more autonomous, said Michael Farthing, chairman of the 1994 Group of smaller research universities. &quot;Autonomy will make us less obsessed with lobbying our government and lead to us taking more responsibility ourselves for developing a high-quality student experience,&quot; he said. Competition would be key in making universities more aware of student expectations &quot;and I think that&apos;s a good thing&quot;. Speakers at the summit described a future of increasing competition from overseas universities and new private providers. It was a future in which UK graduates would need to be multilingual and have experience of living and working overseas to have a hope of competing for global jobs; a future in which credit transfer between institutions and countries would become easier and more common; in which research would become more globalised and in which new technology would transform where and when courses were delivered. The opening session on internationalism had plenty of encouragement for UK higher education. &quot;If all universities could be as good as those in the UK I think the world could be a better place, and that has a lot to do with the way they are run and led and managed,&quot; said Richard Yelland, head of education management and infrastructure at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But there were also warnings. Paul Webley, director of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said overseas students were particularly concerned about the abolition of the post-study work visa. &quot;We need to be attractive as a country, and that means providing jobs, not just education,&quot; he said. He was also worried about what the turmoil of the past two years had done for British higher education as a brand. &quot;The UK does very well in international league tables, but we must remember its reputation can be damaged very easily,&quot; he said. Yelland warned the sector not to neglect disadvantaged students in the desire to be internationally attractive, and Eva Egron-Polak, secretary general at the International Association of Universities, urged institutions to keep a balance between being competitive and offering high-quality education, responsive to society&apos;s needs. Balance was also important in university collaborations overseas, which should not be neo-colonial, but partnerships between equals, she said. Collaboration was a strong theme of the summit. Tim Wilson, emeritus professor at the University of Hertfordshire and author of a recent report into how universities work with business, urged more collaboration between universities and medium-sized enterprises. The UK&apos;s research base was one of the best, but least exploited, in the world, he told the summit. Research collaborations between institutions and academics at home and abroad were also becoming increasingly important, the summit heard; 10% of engineering publications now have a Chinese co-author. Speakers and delegates stressed that students were not consumers, customers or clients, but &quot;co-creators&quot; or &quot;partners in a lifelong community&quot;. Institutions were increasingly fostering a long-term relationship with their alumni, offering them access to careers advice long after they had left, helping them to understand the skills they had gained, and building relationships between present and past graduates. No one, including Martin Williams, director of higher education policy at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, could confidently guess what the effects of this year&apos;s funding changes would be on student choices and different social groups. But Williams said they would force universities to think about whether their traditional way of operating gave students the best life chances for a future when they would be employed for longer and when technology would transform the way they learn and work. Students would also need more information and advice about the choices available to them, requiring more collaboration between universities and schools. The summit heard that teachers were becoming increasingly distrustful of universities&apos; glossy brochures and stunts to attract students, while applicants were demanding more transparency about what they could expect from their university experience, including hidden course costs. Egron-Polak suggested that league tables be expanded to include rankings for qualities such as social responsibility and how much debt students carry when they leave, while Onora O&apos;Neill, a philosopher and former head of Newnham College, Cambridge, suggested they should show prospective students &quot;stuff they really need to know&quot;, such as how well students write and speak before they enter and when they leave, both in their own language and in another, how numerate they are, and how many hours they work. &quot;What we measure isn&apos;t very often what employers or intending students want to know  but material useful for ratings and rankings,&quot; she said. In spite of the rapidly changing face of universities, delegates recognised that they remained a remarkably stable feature of society. &quot;Of all the institutions you have dealings with in your life, if a university says it will be there in 30 years, it probably will be,&quot; said Williams, which is more than could be said for his boss, David Willetts, who pulled out of addressing the summit because of pre-budget pressure of work. Closing the conference, Peter Slee, deputy vice-chancellor of Huddersfield University, said almost everything that UK higher education holds dear was being questioned, but the questions were important ones. &quot;Politicians believe universities make a bigger contribution to the economy and a globalising state than ever before,&quot; he said. &quot;That is a privilege. And because it&apos;s a privilege we have to take changes on the chin.&quot;",

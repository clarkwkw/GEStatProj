    "text": "Beyond the updated fighter line-up, which includes two new weight classes (featherweight and bantamweight) and the addition of a Pride fighting mode, UFC Undisputed 3 seems little different to its predecessor. Subtle changes, however, are soon noticeable, both in scope and substance, making this the most realistic and technical fight sim to date. The controls remain largely unchanged, with buttons used to deliver powerful strikes to the head, body or legs (you can now even finish fights with bone-shattering leg-strike TKOs) and the right thumbstick controlling transitions in a clinch or when wrestling on the ground. In EA&apos;s MMA, THQ&apos;s rival developer opted for the opposite configuration, using the thumbstick for complex punch combinations, thereby creating a simpler ground game. Nevertheless, THQ has made progress with its own fight dynamics, superbly capturing individual fighter styles and signature moves. There&apos;s a new submission system that makes it easier to finish opponents with controlled thumbstick movements (no more frantic rotating), cage interaction to &quot;wall-walk&quot; when backed up, and sway motions to dodge bombs when on your back. Considering how quick some fights can be (flash KOs are rare, but possible), THQ would do well to improve its tardy load times. But that aside, Undisputed 3 is an accomplished game with a satisfyingly steep learning curve, whether you&apos;re seeking a post-pub rumble or a &quot;hall of fame&quot; career. And thankfully it&apos;s free of the online bugs that plagued the last version, making for a much improved online experiencetoo.",

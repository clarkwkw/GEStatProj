The dual evolution of the University of Huddersfield into an anchor institution in its community and a sector leader in business engagement has been recognised through the award of Entrepreneurial University of the Year 2012. Bob is a leader in every sense of the word. His financial stewardship is exemplary, taking the university out of debt whilst embarking on 100m of visionary developments without borrowing. He is well known to staff at all levels and fosters in them a strong commitment to the university&apos;s mission and to its business-engagement agenda, where students are kept at the heart of the institution, where the skills base of the local economy is fuelled by the university, and where the university is recognised as being a source of innovation and applied research. Under Bob&apos;s inspirational leadership Huddersfield has undergone a major transformation resulting in a tripling of postgraduate and international students and moving up a stunning 47 places in the Guardian University League Table.

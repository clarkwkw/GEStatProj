    "text": "The coalition&apos;s defamation bill will not make it easier to unmask internet trolls (Spot the troll, G2, 13 June). Spin from Downing Street is giving victims of cyber-bullying false hope. The best advice to victims is often to ignore the unpleasant or offensive comments made by those who cower behind anonymity online. It is best not to &quot;feed the trolls&quot; because a reaction is precisely what they want. Worse, taking action can often unleash the &quot;Streisand effect&quot;  as footballer Ryan Giggs found to his cost when he obtained a super-injunction over a (true) story that he ought simply to have ignored. Only if the trolls cross into harassment is it worth doing something  and the defamation bill (as the name suggests) only deals with defamatory comments, not harassment.

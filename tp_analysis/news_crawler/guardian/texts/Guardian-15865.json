    "text": "     After four years in the making, Codemasters has produced its purest racing simulation yet. Every ounce of processing power from the current ageing consoles has been harnessed for exceptionally smooth photorealism, with a scale of background so vast it can only be fully appreciated from a distance. But the looks are a sideshow to the really compelling engine here: edge-of-control driving without the auto-assist safety net, where the spectrum of damage physics means you&apos;ll often bring your car limping home with sizable chunks missing. The driving experience is both exhilarating and terrifying, on street, road and track, and in building up rivalries with other drivers and competing across disciplines in World Series events. There are unexpected omissions, such as the original&apos;s excellent destruction derby mode, but Grid 2 remains the complete racing experience. Unmissable.",

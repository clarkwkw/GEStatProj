    "text": "Britain&apos;s windfarms broke a new record on Friday by providing over four gigawatts of power to the National Grid  enough to light and heat more than 3m British homes. It beats a previous high of 3.8GW set in May and comes as a further 4GW of wind turbines are being installed, half on land and half offshore. Just before 10am, wind turbines were supplying 10.8% of the total amount of electricity going into the grid while an additional 2.2GW of &quot;green&quot; power was going directly into local electricity networks. &quot;This record high shows that wind energy is providing a reliable, secure supply of clean electricity to an ever-greater number of British homes and businesses,&quot; said Maria McCaffery, chief executive at the campaign group RenewableUK. &quot;As our wind energy capacity increases, the need to import expensive fossil fuels starts to diminish. The transition to a low-carbon economy is well under way and harnessing this bountiful, free resource will help us to drive down energy bills for all users in the long term.&quot; Critics will point out that the 4.1GW total compares with the UK&apos;s largest coal and biomass-fired power station, Drax in North Yorkshire, which produces almost that amount of power on its own.",

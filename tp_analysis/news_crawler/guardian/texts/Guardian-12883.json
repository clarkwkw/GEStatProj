    "text": "A Google doodle has been unveiled today to mark what would have been the 88th birthday of cult author and illustrator Edward Gorey. Gorey, who died in April 2000 at the age of 75, was known for often macabre drawings and picture-stories which gained him a worldwide cult following. The doodle features six cartoonish pictures spelling out the name of the search engine in his surreal cartoonish style. Gorey&apos;s work inspired the film director Tim Burton and the goth rock band Nine Inch Nails. His macabre books frequently showed children or other hapless victims succumbing to an undeserved death. As well as his own picture story books, the Chicago-born artist illustrated works by authors including Samuel Beckett, TS Eliot, Edward Lear and Muriel Spark, as well as drawing new pictures for Aesop&apos;s fables and the Brer Rabbit stories. Gorey was an eccentric. In the 25 years between 1957 and 1982 he did not miss a performance by the New York City Ballet, attending in an outfit consisting of an enormous fur coat and white tennis shoes. His melodramatically sinister sets and costumes for the 1977 Broadway production of Dracula netted him a Tony Award for costume design.",

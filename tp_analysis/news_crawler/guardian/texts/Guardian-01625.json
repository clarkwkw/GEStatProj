    "text": "      Speaking of science fairs, did you know that the White House recently held their science fair? In this video, we meet President Obama as he hosts the second White House Science Fair to celebrate the student winners of a broad range of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) competitions from across the country.  &quot;If you win the NCAA championship, you come to the White House. Well, if you&apos;re a young person and you produce the best experiment or design, the best hardware or software, you ought to be recognized for that achievement, too&quot;, said President Obama shortly before the first White House Science Fair in late 2010.    &quot;When students excel in math and science, they help America compete for the jobs and industries of the future&quot;, said President Obama.  &quot;That&apos;s why I&apos;m proud to celebrate outstanding students at the White House Science Fair, and to announce new steps my administration and its partners are taking to help more young people succeed in these critical subjects.&quot; In addition to hearing from President Obama in this video, we also meet Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. This is the second science fair that has been hosted by President Obama in the White House.

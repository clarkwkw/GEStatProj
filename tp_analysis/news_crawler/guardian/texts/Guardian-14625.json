    "text": "Perhaps Terraria might simplistically be painted as &quot;Minecraft in 2D, with cutesy pixel art&quot;. It&apos;s not necessarily the fairest description though, as each game&apos;s approach to world-building is very different. Terraria is a touch more focused. There are objectives  mainly bosses to find and defeat  and a greater emphasis on combat than its blocky rival. It&apos;s also more imaginative in what it allows players to craft, from laser swords to magic spells. This new console port proves tricky though  controls are far from intuitive and you&apos;ll want to play the short tutorial to get the best from the game. Once you &quot;get&quot; it though, the world is yours, and multiplayer through Xbox Live is a joy.",

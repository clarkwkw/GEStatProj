    "text": "First of all, the motion says &quot;would&quot;. I take this to mean &quot;would, if we could&quot;. Science requires experiment, and there are some questions we do not have the means to address scientifically, at least at the moment.  But I support the aspiration and I hope you will too.  &quot;Scientific Investigation&quot; is a technique for achieving knowledge which is as unbiased and objective as possible.  It is not infallible, it is not always particularly efficient, but it is quite simply the best way we have of not fooling ourselves. Are there any areas of knowledge that we want to fool ourselves about? I don&apos;t think so. Knowledge may be uncomfortable, but ignorance can be catastrophic. Given the background and profile of the other speakers, I suspect much of this debate will focus on research around human life. When it comes to life, I&apos;m an amateur. But I think a couple of examples from physics might help. The most stunning one, I think, is the development of quantum mechanics. From the point of view of physicists at the time, this was a complete car crash. The model - of seeking underlying mechanisms for physical processes - which had served incredibly well from at least the time of Copernicus through Newton, Kelvin and even Einstein (who participated in its overthrow but never accepted its consequences) came about through repeated application of the scientific method.  In the face of the most massive cultural biases, the fact was established.  Nature stubbornly behaved in a way which could only be understood by rethinking pretty much every assumption ever made by the most influential physicists - the heroes. In the end quantum mechanics rules. It works. It lies behind the whole digital technology of our civilisation, and more besides. And it went counter to every established scientific prejudice of the days, except for the prejudice that the method works. The physicists of old might be horrified by the outcome, and by the cultural miasma that allows, for example, homeopaths to claim quantum mechanics gives water memory. But they would I hope be proud of the success of the scientific method. (Which of course also tells us that water is water, sugar is sugar, and placebos are placebos.) There are moral debates to be had about the uses to which knowledge is put. There are moral debates to be had about the development of specific technologies from knowledge. But the debate around the morality of nuclear weapons would not be well-served by declaring the study of fundamental physics off limits. Nor would the debates about cloning, or genetic engineering, be well served by declaring the study of life off limits. The scientific pursuit of an understanding of the universe in which we live, the basic constituents, life itself, and the farthest galaxies, is an interconnected and unpredictable activity. Incremental advances in one area can cause sudden revolutions in another. To declare some areas out of bounds would not only be unpredictably damaging in its impact, but would probably be doomed to failure.  A rear-guard action against some uncomfortable areas of knowledge may succeed in delaying the inevitable; but surely it is better to seek the knowledge, and face the moral issues which follow with open eyes and minds. None of that is intended to imply that the very pursuit of knowledge is such a high imperative that it negates all other considerations. In particular, we are back to the &quot;means&quot; here, and the &quot;would&quot; in the title of the motion. An example close to my heart: The Large Hadron Collider and the discovery of a Higgs boson - in fact the whole of particle physics together - costs the UK taxpayer about 2 a year. There are no significant environmental or existential risks, and many benefits. If the cost were an order of magnitude higher, one might start to ask whether the money could be better spent. It may be that the returns would also rise, and we would all benefit. Certainly the endeavour much more than pays for itself at present. But a net financial outlay would raise moral and practical questions about priorities for public expenditure.  And if there had been any credible risk of creating, for example, black holes which might consume the world (or even a suburb of Geneva), that would clearly have been a problem.  None of that would have been reason to label the Higgs boson itself off limits in principle. But they may have been reasons to halt that line of research until better (safer, more affordable) methods were available. Similarly, considerations about damage or risk to humans, to animals or to the environment, might impact upon efforts to understand biology, psychology or related areas. Knowledge, the ends, do not justify all means. But regulating means and methods is a very different matter from declaring certain areas closed in principle to scientific inquiry. So I would have all areas of knowledge open in principle. If no acceptable means exist to address, scientifically, some important area, I would have us develop better means. But to declare any area closed in principle to scientific inquiry is to declare that we wish to be fooled.  And nature, the universe, does not treat fools kindly. I urge you to support the motion. The debate also featured Lewis Wolpert (on the same side as me) with Caroline Harrison and Michael Reiss opposing, plus some good speeches from the floor. More information here. It seemed to go quite well.",

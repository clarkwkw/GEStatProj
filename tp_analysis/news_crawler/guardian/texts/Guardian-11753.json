    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view DmC&apos;s baddie, Kyle Ryder, is a villain of our times: an evil banker seeking to enslave the world through debt. Yet, this being Devil May Cry, he&apos;s also working for old demonic antagonist Mundus and has a few supernatural powers of his own. Only fair, given hero Dante&apos;s outlandish range of magical weaponry and screen-filling special moves, not to mention the makeovers given to him and his family; Dante now looks more like a mod than a floppy-haired anime character. Taking place partly in the real world and partly in limbo, the latter is where most of the action occurs. Here, it&apos;s not just enemies that try to kill Dante: entire streets fold in on themselves in attempts to devour him. The action is fast but strategic, with each enemy requiring its own tactics and weapon combinations to dispatch it, and the abandon of early levels soon gives way to much more demanding and potentially lethal engagements as you progress.",

    "text": "The mobile industry disruption wrought by Apple, Samsung and smartphones more generally in the last five years continues, making it hard to predict how the next five years will shake out, even for those currently-dominant manufacturers, according to Asymco founder Horace Dediu. Dediu was speaking at the Guardian Mobile Business Summit 2012 conference in London, where he gave a keynote speech on the structural and macroeconomic challenges facing the mobile industry, and what it means for businesses. &quot;The challenge in the last few years of predicting anything is that things have changed so rapidly,&quot; said Dediu, noting that in the first quarter of 2007, Nokia sold 91.1m handsets, rising to 133.5m in the fourth quarter of that year. By early 2012 Samsung had overtaken Nokia, yet when it comes to actual revenues, Apple had already overtaken the company towards the end of 2011 and it was already the most profitable mobile handset maker in late 2009. &quot;All of this is because of smartphones,&quot; said Dediu. &quot;There&apos;s only one theory we know of in business that explains this phenomenon: it&apos;s called disruption theory.. It means small beats large. It means David beats Goliath.&quot; Dediu pointed out that all this has happened in the mobile industry over the course of five years two handset upgrades for many people with Nokia clearly not predicting Apple&apos;s rise, but also Apple possibly not predicting Samsung&apos;s more recent rise too. &quot;The struggle here isn&apos;t to say will smartphones win? That&apos;s obvious. The question is will smartphones capture profits as they have until now? Will they reward those who make them?&quot; said Dediu. &quot;Google makes less money from mobility than Samsung does. Samsung, as a primary beneficiary of Android is making more profitability from Android than all of Google.&quot; Dediu also noted that 510m mobile phones have been sold in 2012, versus 367.8m PCs and 88m tablets, leading him to suggest that &quot;PC/post-PC parity has been reached&quot;, with mobile phones now accounting for 53% of the computing market and tablets 9%. He finished by wondering what the saturation point will be for smartphones, at a time when 80% of the handset models are being sold are smartphones, but around 50% of usage is on smartphones. &quot;Will networks be good enough?&quot; he wondered, pointing to questions about whether mobile networks will be good enough for sustaining the current level of smartphone usage. &quot;We think of these as computers, but they need to connect and act as computers on the network, and we all know the difficulty of doing that even in developed markets,&quot; he said. The crucial question? &quot;What are these things going to be used for?&quot; asked Dediu, referring to the fact that we&apos;re still in the relatively early stages of understanding how people use their smartphones and tablets, particularly when they own several. &quot;It isn&apos;t just going to be 4bn people. We shouldn&apos;t think of it that way. We should think of it as 4bn connections, as the operators do, but we should also think of it as 4bn devices that are going to be used by a population as big as maybe 3bn people in the next five years.&quot;",

So captivated by moths and butterflies was I that I seriously considered devoting my professional career to studying them.  But butterflies and moths -- the lepidopterans -- are more than just pretty insects that pollinate plants. They are important research subjects that provide valuable glimpses into evolutionary processes. They provide scientists with important insights into sexual selection, speciation, and the relationship between ecology and evolution and between genetics and evolution.    One important resource for studying lepidopterans is museum collections. The California Academy of Sciences is home to the largest collection of biological reference materials west of the Mississippi. Dating back over 100 years, the collection provides a treasure trove of biological information for scientists and researchers studying the natural world. Of the 20 million specimens housed at the Cal Academy, 17 million are insects in the Entomology Department. In this fascinating video, Collections Manager Norman Penny shares a small peek at The Academy&apos;s vast butterfly collection, and as a special treat, he shows us an extremely rare gynandromorph -- a half male half female butterfly:            [video link]  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

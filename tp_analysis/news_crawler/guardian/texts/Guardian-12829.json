    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view For the majority of Black Ops II fans, the single-player campaign&apos;s eight-ish hours of special forces hijinks are a fleeting distraction before getting down to the long-term business of gunning down strangers online. New downloadable content, Revolution, gives you four extra maps in which to exact random vengeance. Hydro is set at a Pakistani dam; Mirage in a destroyed hotel in the Gobi Desert; Downhill at an Alpine ski resort; and Grind in a Venice Beach skatepark. Each has distinctive terrain features that influence the way you play, from Hydro&apos;s occasional watery deluge to Grind&apos;s unusually rounded, sloping environments, although none changes the game&apos;s trademark tactics-free intensity. You also get Die Rise, a new skyscraper-based zombie survival map, and the Peacemaker, a decent submachine gun that does nothing to unbalance the game. So while it&apos;s called Revolution, it&apos;s actually anything but.",

    "text": "Ninjas are not supposed to be child-friendly. They&apos;re samurai-sword-wielding, medieval mercenaries and were once considered so unsuitable for consumption by youngsters that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became the rather less fearsome Hero Turtles when they first arrived on UK TV screens. Times have changed. Mini Ninjas (Square Enix, iOS, 69p), launched to critical praise on consoles in 2009, was a cartoon action adventure aimed at a young audience. The series has now arrived on the iPhone, but reinvented as an endless runner. With a tap on the left side of the screen you jump, a tap on the right triggers an attack, and the goal is to get as far as possible while collecting coins and ingredients that can be used for power-ups and enhancements to the characters. These can all be purchased for real money too  but the game can be enjoyed perfectly well without splashing any cash. The 2D animation has been carefully transferred to the small screen and looks superb, although the sheer level of detail in the foreground sometimes makes it awkward to spot an obstacle to be hurdled or an item to be collected. The controls are smooth and responsive and while it isn&apos;t reinventing the wheel, it&apos;s a perfectly good example of the genre. Toy Story: Smash It! (Walt Disney, 69p, Android) is more obviously aimed at children, featuring all the favourite characters from the Pixar films, but has a lot to recommend it. You control Buzz Lightyear as he flings balls at crudely constructed toy forts, the aim being to topple them and get to the aliens within. It&apos;s done so well, with precise controls and satisfyingly accurate destruction, that Smash It! has to be one of the best games of its type released for some time.",

Along the way I got a glimpse of what life is like for the thousands of Palestinian refugees in Irbid, in northern Jordan, saw some of the work being done in Ramallah to prevent maternal deaths and improve healthcare for women and children, and found out more about Japan&apos;s &quot;Corridor of Peace and Prosperity&quot;, a grand plan (and not without some controversy) to encourage dialogue and co-operation between Jordan, the Palestinians, Israel and Japan. The trip was a great opportunity to tweet about the lives of some of the people I met, as well as anecdotes I picked up and conversations I had along the way, including those with other Twitter users who wanted to share their thoughts on the region. Some of these conversations might not make it into an article on their own, but they offered an insight into the situation on the ground. I met people like Issa Aburahmeh in Jericho, who spoke about rising food prices in the region and of his hopes that his training to become a tour guide in the city will bring in some much needed extra money. There was the medical staff in Ramallah, who told me about the problems women faced accessing healthcare during the second intifada, and the headteacher of one of the schools in Irbid refugee camp, Fatima Azaiza, who told me how she lived in the camp and had attended the school herself when she was younger. She remains confident that most of her pupils will go on to university. I&apos;ll be writing up some stories from my trip over the coming weeks. But here are a selection of my tweets from the trip.

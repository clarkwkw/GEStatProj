    "text": "This was always going to happen, of course. Last year, when Nintendo launched its Wii U console, the company mentioned that the machine&apos;s touchscreen GamePad device would support &quot;near-field communications&quot;, a technology that allows two compatible items to communicate with each other over short distances.  Consumers barely noticed at the time, but they&apos;re going to notice soon, because Pokmon Rumble U, the latest spinoff from the hugely popular monster fighting series will support the feature.  Currently only planned for release in Japan, the game will come with a selection of cute figures, which can be placed on the GamePad screen, storing data and achievements from the virtual battleground. According to Eurogamer, six standard and one special figure have been revealed so far  and naturally the first to be shown off is Pikachu, the yellow critter that pretty much symbolises the series.  This is a pretty lowkey start  the Pokemon Rumble titles are rather limited arena-based brawlers, available for download rather than as boxed retail games. But Nintendo is highly unlikely to leave it there. The company, which has seen disappointing sales of the Wii U console so far can&apos;t fail to have noticed the huge success of Activision&apos;s Skylanders games, which come with action figures (each sold separately) that can be placed on a Portal of Power to interact with the onscreen action. The series has earned its publisher more than $1bn dollars at a time when retail software sales are falling. Disney certainly has paid attention. This summer it will launch Infinity, an open-world adventure game that will be accompanied by a range of compatible action figures from hit movies including Cars, The Incredibles and Toy Story. It&apos;s likely to be the entertainment company&apos;s biggest-ever video game release.  The big question is whether Nintendo is planning a mainstream Pokmon release for the Wii U with a global audience in mind, and with a larger range of collectible characters. And the answer must surely be, &quot;Yes, unless Nintendo has gone mad.&quot; There are almost 700 Pokmon critters across the range of games now, which stretches back to the first title on the Game Boy in 1996  that&apos;s a lot of toy sales. This is a game series that&apos;s sold more than 200m copies, a series with legions of fans who&apos;ve bought countless tie-in toys, movies, trading card packs and outfits.  Parents and gamers may need to consult their bank balances. The a-Pok-lypse is coming.",

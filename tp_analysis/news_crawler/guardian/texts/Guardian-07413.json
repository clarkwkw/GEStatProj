    "text": "The truth of scientific discovery is this: though the work may be done by an exceptional team, the world only gets to know about one exceptional individual. It would seem that in a world of citations, publications and conference presentations, every academic needs to know one thing: that career progression is dependent on oneself. But the reality, of course, is that no man is an island and scientists, and indeed all researchers, are dependent on others - and at no other time is that more obvious that at the start of one&apos;s career. Making the case for mentoring, Janni Aragon says: &quot;Most academics do not enter graduate school knowing how to artfully construct a CV, apply for a position, grant, or give conference presentation. It is only through our networks that we can find out about pertinent information and opportunities on campus and in higher education.&quot; In a sector where so many will have to work at a variety of institutions - each with its own particularities and cultures - in order to advance their careers, it seems absurd that that case needs making at all. But as I scoured the web for what was available on academic mentoring, time and again, blogs included a justification for peer-to-peer support. Claire Stocks at the University of Manchester explains: &quot;Many academics and researchers underestimate the impact that mentoring can have in helping them to establish and further their careers. [Though] the quality of your research is also undeniably important, how you work and communicate with others is also key to getting you that elusive job and ensuring that you keep it.&quot; Writing for Nature magazine, Michelle Oyen, a lecturer at Cambridge University goes on to assert that while &quot;it is easy to grow cynical of modern academic life, [her] hope for fellow beleaguered academics, especially the young ones just beginning their careers in academia, is to resist the temptation to put mentoring on the back burner.&quot; Though it would be impossible to create a blueprint for good mentoring because ultimately it&apos;s about human relationships and every relationship is unique, it is still possible to explore the attitudes, expectations, and activities that are worth adopting, as well as give some guidance on how to build relationships that will be mutually-beneficial. It is also worth talking about the different ways of giving and receiving support - what, for example, is the difference between mentoring, coaching and sponsoring? The aim of our live chat, this Friday 10 August, is to explore these issues and answer these questions.

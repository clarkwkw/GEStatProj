    "text": "The US looms large in much of the media coverage of Android and iOS. Google and Apple are both headquartered in Silicon Valley, as are plenty of well-funded startups and globally-recognised technology blogs. With 165m active iOS and Android devices in the US alone, it&apos;s also the world&apos;s biggest market for smartphone apps on these platforms. Yet the research that 165m figure is drawn from a study by mobile analytics firm Flurry also makes it clear that there are opportunities well beyond the US for Android and iOS developers. Published earlier this week, the research is based on analytics data from 200k applications using Flurry&apos;s tools. The headline claim is that there were more than 640m Android and iOS devices in use during July 2012. The &quot;in use&quot; part is important, for Apple and Google&apos;s own figures tend to focus on sales (or activations, in Google&apos;s case) over the lifetime of their platforms. Apple said in July 2012 that it had sold 410m iOS devices since the first iPhone&apos;s launch in 2007, while Google revealed in June 2012 that it had activated 400m Android devices. Flurry claims that its 165m active iOS and Android devices in July made the US the largest market in the world in terms of combined usage of the platforms it doesn&apos;t split them out ahead of China&apos;s 128m, the UK&apos;s 31m, South Korea&apos;s 28m and Japan&apos;s 22m. What&apos;s more interesting than the pure figures, though, is the wider trend. &quot;Year-over-year, Flurry calculates that net active devices in the U.S. grew by approximately 30 million, while China saw more than 100 million new active devices enter the market,&quot; explains Flurry&apos;s Peter Farago in the company&apos;s blog post. &quot;At this rate, China&apos;s active installed base could overtake the United States as early as the 2012 Holiday season.&quot; In fact, Flurry&apos;s separate chart of the fastest growing iOS and Android markets by active devices the one at the top of this article expands on this. China, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Iran, Vietnam, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and India make up the top 10 all with more than half a million active devices in July 2011. &quot;Notably, all four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are represented in the top 10-ten growth countries for smart devices, reinforcing their new stage of advanced economic development,&quot; wrote Farago. Or to put it another way: 165m active Android and iOS devices in the US is impressive, but add the BRIC countries together China (128m), Brazil (13m), India (11m) and Russia (9m) and you get 161m active devices just on these two platforms. Now think about potential growth. Another Flurry chart maps its active-user estimates against the adult populations of each country to gauge how near to saturation they are. It suggests that the US has 78% penetration of active iOS and Android devices, while the UK has 74%.     Are countries like the US and UK nearing saturation point? Source: Flurry    This raises a red flag for me: three quarters of the UK population weren&apos;t using an Android or iOS device in July 2012. comScore stats published in May suggest that overall smartphone penetration was 55% in March 2012, and that&apos;s a figure that includes BlackBerry, Windows Phone and Symbian. Meanwhile, Google&apos;s Our Mobile Planet research suggests that 51% of the UK population currently owns a smartphone, with iOS and Android taking a 59% combined share of that 51%, rather than the population as a whole. Flurry&apos;s figures must include people with multiple devices an iPhone and an iPad, for example. Update: I asked Flurry&apos;s Farago about this, and he points out that Flurry&apos;s penetration stats cover 15-64 year-old adults, rather than the entire population. &quot;For the UK, Flurry&apos;s penetration estimate against the total population, from infants to the truly venerable, comes in at 49%,&quot; he says, adding that the company sees &quot;not that large&quot; an overlap for multiple device ownership. Even so, its stats still hint at growth to come in those BRIC markets: 10% of the Chinese adult population are using an Android or iOS device according to Flurry presumably with the same multiple-device caveats while the penetration stands at 6% in Brazil and Russia, and 1% in India. A bonanza in store for app developers? Perhaps. But that bonanza may well come from startups and developers based in those countries who understand the markets and the business models required for success. Which is a long-winded way of saying the most interesting apps companies in the next five years are more likely to come from Brazil, Russia, India and China as Silicon Valley.

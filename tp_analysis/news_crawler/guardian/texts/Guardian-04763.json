    "headline": "Are colleges being overseen by the right inspectors?", 
    "text": "In Education Guardian recently, I examined certain features of the inspection process known as &quot;educational oversight&quot;  how colleges were being sacrificed by ministers&apos; pandering to the anti-immigration lobby. Judging from the size and content of my mailbag, I certainly touched a raw nerve. Educational oversight (EO) is the inspection process mandated by the UK Border Agency for almost all privately funded educational establishments that wish to recruit international students. Any such establishment must in future possess the Border Agency&apos;s &quot;highly trusted status&quot;, which will only be granted following a successful inspection. The Border Agency has authorised a small number of nominally independent agencies to perform these inspections on its behalf. The two main bodies are the Quality Assurance Agency and the Independent Schools Inspectorate. Broadly speaking, the QAA deals with providers offering mainly higher education programmes, and the ISI with those mainly (but not exclusively) offering courses falling below the HE threshold. The ISI began life as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Independent Schools Council, established in 1974 by the main providers of private primary and secondary education in the UK. At the beginning of 2012, the ISI became a legally separate entity with its own board of directors, nominated by its founding &quot;members&quot;. These members comprise eight associations representative of schools in the private sector. No association representing further or higher education is included in the membership category, nor is any association representative of language schools, which also now come within the EO remit as operated by the ISI; these schools were historically accredited by the British Council, but its prestigious imprimatur was  for reasons that remain unexplained  deemed by the UK Border Agency to be unacceptable for these purposes. The new &quot;stakeholders&quot; of the ISI  private institutions offering further and higher education  in fact have no forum or framework within which they can be consulted about the EO process. They must accept whatever the ISI presents to them. The ISI&apos;s current EO inspection procedure was, I am told, &quot;formulated by a group of inspectors and professionals within ISI and agreed with the Home Office&quot;. Who were these inspectors? Who were these &quot;professionals&quot;? We simply do not know. But the admitted role of the Home Office is noteworthy. It means that a significant segment of FE and HE provision in the UK is now subject to an inspection process overseen by a department of government that has no experience whatever of these sectors, and whose interests fall far from those with genuine expertise in these matters. The Home Office&apos;s sensitivities in this regard are palpable. My Freedom of Information (FoI) request to see copies of relevant communications between the HO and the ISI (and the QAA, incidentally) was refused. How has the ISI organised itself to take on its new responsibilities? Every institution subject to ISI inspection must produce an organisational chart. But when I asked the ISI for a copy of its own organisational chart, I was told that this was &quot;not available to the public&quot;. What we do know  on the record  is that the ISI&apos;s &quot;head of communications&quot; acts also as its quality assurance supremo and that its chief inspector is also its chief executive. She is presumably, therefore, in line-management to herself. These matters must surely be of public concern, the more so when we realise that a great many of the institutions inspected for EO purposes by the ISI do in fact teach at higher as well as further education levels. Some, indeed, teach programmes at master&apos;s level. The scrutiny of these by inspectors provided by a body whose inspectorial experience has not hitherto extended beyond that of the secondary school is deeply worrying. Amazingly, there is no written agreement between the Home Office and the ISI covering its EO work and responsibilities. But the Home Office has provided the ISI with a deed of indemnity. That means that, ultimately, the costs of any successful legal challenge to an ISI inspection will be borne by the taxpayer. This itself seems to constitute sufficient grounds for public scrutiny of the manner in which this wholly private body  the ISI  performs its public duties.

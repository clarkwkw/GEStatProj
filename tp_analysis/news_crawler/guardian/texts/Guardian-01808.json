    "text": "Joining us at 1-2pm today is Ed Stafford, the first man to walk the length of the Amazon river.  Stafford is the public face of the Rainforest Reporter competition, launched today by the RSPB and Tesco as part of a new partnership to raise 1m in the first year of a partnership to protect rainforests from deforestation.            Whatever you want to ask about the Amazon rainforest, this is your chance. Interested in what the first-hand experience of trekking the Amazon is like? Want to know his thoughts on plans to water down logging penalties through changes to the Forest Code? Or do you just want to know more about survival and exploration in the wilderness? Post your questions below for Stafford - please note anything off-topic will be removed.",

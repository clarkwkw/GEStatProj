    "text": "      Everyone loves kazoos and today is the day when you can proudly celebrate the joy this musical instrument brings to millions of people around the world. The kazoo is one of the few instruments that was invented in the United States and it&apos;s one of the easiest to play since the only requirement is the ability to hum (humming in tune is desirable, but optional, of course).  Why did I say this is an unofficial day of observance? Because a &quot;national day&quot; in the United States requires an act of congress, which hasn&apos;t happened. (But you don&apos;t have to be American to observe this unofficial day of observance, and that&apos;s the beauty of it.) What do you do on National Kazoo day? Play the kazoo, of course.  Since I will be attending a local performance of Handel&apos;s Messiah, it seems appropriate to share a small part of The Messiah as played on kazoos by the one and only Northwestern University Kazoo Choir (NUKC). Why did the band choose kazoos? &quot;Because everyone else plays it on real instruments.&quot;               Visit RoseInTheWinter&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  As you can clearly hear, Handel wrote this piece of music specifically for the kazoo. It took hundreds of years for musicians to perfect the exact interpretation that Handel intended, but now the great composer can rest in peace, knowing that we finally understand his genius.  NOTE: the silly cat/pet/animal videos that are shared here on Saturday (Caturday) mornings are intended to amuse. This feature is designed to help hard-working and stressed-out people shed their professional faade so they can be better friends, companions, parents, family members and drinking pals to those in their personal lives. Any relationship between these videos and science or any scientific principle is sweet when I manage to present a solid connection to you, but is random, mostly unintended and usually coincidental.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientistevil google+: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

    "text": "Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma describes her appointment to head the African Union as a &quot;victory for Africans  in particular for women&quot;. And it&apos;s no understatement. Her appointment, after a fiercely fought contest with her predecessor, Jean Ping, makes her the first woman to lead the AU or its antecedent, the Organisation of African Unity, in their 50-year history. No small achievement in this male-dominated continent  of the 54 AU member states only two, Liberia and Malawi, have female presidents. Dlamini-Zuma considers it a sign that Africa&apos;s leaders &quot;have realised that women can take responsibilities just like men&quot;. She also recognises that as a woman she will have to work much harder than any of her male counterparts. But she is no stranger to that. In her previous job as South Africa&apos;s home affairs minister, she transformed a government department notorious for mismanagement  within two years, the home affairs office received its first clean audit in more than a decade and a half. The AU may, however, prove a much harder proposition. Underfunded, understaffed and overstretched, the AU commission (AUC)  the AU&apos;s secretariat, which Dlamini-Zuma chairs  is badly in need of administrative reform. &quot;I think we should strengthen the organisation generally  its systems, its financial management, but also its capacity and the method [and] culture of work,&quot; Dlamini-Zuma says in an interview in her spacious office on the 18th floor of the new, Chinese-built, AU conference centre in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Dlamini-Zuma says the biggest challenges facing the continent are underdevelopment, poverty and the inequitable distribution of wealth. Since taking over as chairwoman in October, she has repeatedly stressed the need to ensure that peace and security issues  which she believes take &quot;a lot of time, a lot of energy and a lot of resources&quot;  are balanced with development. &quot;It&apos;s important to understand that development is not a &apos;nice to have&apos;, it&apos;s essential for peace, for stability and for progress in the world,&quot; she says. &quot;To me those are two sides of the same coin  if you don&apos;t develop your country, if people don&apos;t feel [there is] an equitable distribution of wealth, you are actually threatening peace.&quot; &quot;If you look at Africa today,&quot; she says, &quot;we have more than a billion people, and more than 60% of those are young people; that has certain implications.&quot; Those &quot;implications&quot; were clear on the streets of Tunisia and Egypt almost two years ago  the high level of youth unemployment was chief among the triggers of the Arab spring. Africa&apos;s population growth means that 1m new jobs are needed every month and, like many of the leaders she now serves, Dlamini-Zuma is conscious of the problems that could lie ahead if the continent&apos;s youth don&apos;t have access to education and the skills necessary to earn a decent living. Infrastructure is another priority. &quot;We have to get roads, rail  our transport on the high seas [and] we have to get telecommunications infrastructure  everybody&apos;s going broadband and Africa should not be left behind,&quot; Dlamini-Zuma insists. This, she believes, will enable African states to trade among themselves and develop inter-continental tourism. At the same time, she&apos;d like to see the continent explore ways of accelerating the process of industrialisation. &quot;Our GDP is growing but its growing mainly on raw materials  and that&apos;s not sustainable growth,&quot; she says, adding that Africa needs to export more processed goods &quot;so that we can get more value for our products&quot;. Yet she refuses to be drawn on the fighting in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, suggesting that any questions be addressed to the AU&apos;s peace and security division. She is more expansive on Mali, insisting the armed rebels need to give up their idea of secession and a sharia state, and come to the negotiating table. She won&apos;t give a timetable for the deployment of an Ecowas-led force, but says: &quot;War must always be a very last resort.&quot; Whether or not the AU under Dlamini-Zuma&apos;s leadership will be able to fulfil its peace and security commitments at the same time as making progress in social and economic development will largely depend on the funding available to the organisation. At a business banquet in South Africa in October, she expressed shock and concern that 97% of the AU&apos;s programmes are paid for by external partners, acknowledging the difficulties this raises for the organisation when it comes to setting its own priorities. She feels the AU needs to mobilise governments and the private sector to generate more resources for the organisation from within the continent. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter initially how much it is, but we must increasingly be getting more&quot; from member states, Dlamini-Zuma says. &quot;If you ask somebody to help you and you don&apos;t put anything in, they are not sure how seriously you are taking that yourself.&quot;",

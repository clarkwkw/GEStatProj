    "text": "A quick Google search reveals that there are many examples of &apos;lecturers behaving badly&apos; on YouTube. It would seem students are taking to the site to share footage of academics doing things such as rambling on incoherently or losing their patience over &quot;an overly loud yawn.&quot; It&apos;s harder however to find examples, shared by students, of good teaching online. Perhaps when it comes to lecturing, like most things, criticism comes easier than praise. Of course a lack of YouTube clips posted by students doesn&apos;t mean that good teaching isn&apos;t out there - but how do you know good teaching when you see it and how do you equip people to become good teachers? Last month, we took on the first part of that question in a live chat that broadly discussed the role of teachers in academia and the value of teaching as compared to research. But early into the discussion it became clear that within the academic community, there is reticence about being called teachers. Claire Warden, a lecturer at the University of Lincoln says: &quot;Academics are not really &apos;teachers&apos; but (I hope) are enablers of learning. &apos;Teachers&apos; (and this is not in any way derogatory towards teachers) suggests a fairly undemocratic space of someone who knows stuff, telling the stuff they know to people who don&apos;t know stuff. I&apos;m not a big fan of this.&quot; Still, however you choose to define it, the role of a lecturer is an important one for the student, and can be a rewarding one for the academic. Yet, it is one that some feel adequately prepared to do - particularly at the start of their careers. Associate professor Afshan Jafar explains: &quot;Teaching can be quite an unpredictable experience. Coupled with graduate students&apos; relative unfamiliarity with the discipline, it should be expected that teaching will seem, well, a bit &apos;unnatural&apos;.&quot; So on Friday 18 May, we&apos;ll bring together a panel to consider the how-tos of teaching for new and not-so-new academics; from developing modules to dealing with a bad class, handling complaints, sharing resources and seeking help or getting recognition. The discussion will begin at 12 BST in the comments thread below.  This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

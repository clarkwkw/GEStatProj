    "text": "If this is the first you&apos;ve heard ofthe Final Fantasy franchise read no further than the end ofthis paragraph. Go out and cadge yourself a PlayStation 2, buy, borrow or steal a copy of Final Fantasy VII and lock yourself away in a room for at least a month to play it, opening the door only periodically to beg for food and the patience of your loved ones. Then do the same again for Final Fantasies VIII, IX, X and XII. You will lose your job, your children and your mind, but you will experience five of the most epic adventures in the history of gaming. In a nutshell, it will be worth it. Still here? Probably a good decision. Regulars to the Final Fantasy games will know there is a fairly strict formula to the series&apos; grand sagas. As JRPGs (Japanese role-playing games), each isthe tightly scripted tale of a world teetering on the brink of destruction but for a ragged band of ludicrously attractive heroes. But, oh, what heroes. What varied, strange and wonderful heroes, from one-armed environmental terrorists toskittish sky pirates and fading underwater football stars. There is even a character in one game who is essentially just two remote-controlled cats on top of each other, and those who have played it will know that is even more awesome than it sounds. Though a few creatures reappear in every game  such as floating pink nut addicts the Moogles, or the elusive, ostrich-like Chocobos  on the whole each stars a weird new world of unique cities, cultures and monsters, some high fantasy, others sci-fi or steam-punk, all beautifully and painstakingly realised. Even the two-dimensional pixel-art originals share a recognisable aesthetic. Each instalment also debuts new equipment, levelling and combat systems, though all are variations on past themes. Fighting in Final Fantasy tends to be slow, tactical and intelligent. There is no need for speedy thumbs and hair-trigger reflexes, just the abilityto kit out your team for battle and pick calmly from a menu the right move for the right opponent. Your &quot;mad beat-em-up skillz&quot; will not helpyou here. Loyal regulars will know all this. They will also know that Final Fantasy XIII was something of a disappointment. Fans complained that it was too linear, too cinematic, too confusing and at the same time too simple  that it ditched many of the series&apos; best features and introduced very little to compensate. All in all, it was an unlikely candidate for a &quot;sequel&quot;, or whatever the correct term for a sequel to the 13th game in a series is. (Twelfth reimagining, once removed?) The good news is Final Fantasy XIII-2 (PS3/Xbox 360)  out in the UK on 3 February  looks to have righted many of the original&apos;s wrongs. Maps, stories and conversations offer multiple paths, encouraging player choice and exploration. Equipment has been overhauled and improved, and the levelling system streamlined. Combat is more active, and less frustrating: unlike in XIII, the game doesn&apos;t end when the party leader is knocked out, and &quot;Cinematic Actions&quot;  of the form &quot;Tap A now!&quot;  give boss battles in particular a faster, more frantic feel, without punishing ruminative players too unduly. The new monster ally system, which sees our heroes do battle shoulder-to-shoulder with a captured beast of the player&apos;s choice, owes more than a little to Pikachu and friends, but adds a further tactical depth to the game. Once you get past the fact that you have got some great, fat, fire-breathing rhino-thing on your team, your monster ally becomes as beloved a party member as, ahem, new guy Noel. Yep, afraid so. There is that: they have named the new hero Noel, which clearly plays better in territories where it doesn&apos;t conjure the attendant surname &quot;Edmonds&quot;. Still, bearded gameshow host associations aside, this Noel is pleasingly mysterious, in a nonsensical, time-travelling sort of way, and returning hero Serah now vanquishes foes with the aid of a Moogle that transforms itself into a crossbow, which isarguably just as cool as a remote-controlled double-cat. If not cooler. Iknow no higher praise than that. XIII-2 is unlikely to go down as the finest chapter in the Final Fantasy saga, but it should be a welcome returnto form for veterans, and a far better introduction to a much-loved series than its uninspiring predecessor. And if you do find you are hooked then, well, if you can spare six months,PS2s are 25 online, padlocks are a fiver, and families are easilyreplaced.",

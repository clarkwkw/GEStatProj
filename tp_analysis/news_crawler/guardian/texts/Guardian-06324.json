    "text": "Scientists, particularly physicists, prefer to let their numbers do the talking. A fine demonstration of this will come on Wednesday when scientists working with the Large Hadron Collider at Cern are expected to announce to the world that they have finally found the elusive &quot;God particle&quot;, or Higgs boson. Except they can&apos;t say they have definitely found it. Rather, they will express their finding in what statisticians like to call the &quot;confidence interval&quot;. Whereas mere humanities graduates might say it is &quot;incredibly likely&quot;, &quot;almost certain&quot;, &quot;yeah, sort of very probable&quot; that something has been discovered, the physicists at Cern will express it in terms of a &quot;four-sigma confidence interval&quot;. David Hand, professor of statistics at Imperial College London, says that, in &quot;rough ballpark terms&quot;, this equates to a 1 in 30,000 chance they&apos;ve made an error. But that&apos;s not enough: the threshold of certainty they are still seeking is actually five sigmas, which is about a 1 in 3 million chance of being wrong (the probability reduces exponentially). What is certain, though, is that the Cern scientists are confident enough of their discovery to have invited along the team who first proposed the idea of the Higgs boson 48 years ago. &quot;My guess is that it must be a pretty positive result,&quot; says Tom Kibble, the 79-year-old emeritus professor ofphysics at Imperial College.",

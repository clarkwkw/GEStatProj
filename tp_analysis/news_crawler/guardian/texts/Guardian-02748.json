    "text": "The hosepipe ban covering much of southern England could continue into next year, water companies warned on Monday. The ban is due to come into force this Thursday, and will remain in place regardless of how much rain falls over the next few months. It is part of a series of measures being put in place to tackle England&apos;s drought, which last week spread to Yorkshire. A spokeswoman for Veolia Water, one of the seven companies imposing the ban, said: &quot;We&apos;re almost certain that the ban will be throughout the summer and possibly to the end of the year.&quot; She admitted that if rainfall stayed low over the coming winter, they would be forced to consider extending the hosepipe ban into 2013. &quot;It would stay in place until we felt that it was appropriate to take that off.&quot; The drought has been caused by exceptionally low rainfall during the key winter and spring months known as the &quot;recharge period&quot;. For the last two years, rainfall during this time has been 60% of normal levels, leaving river levels as low as they were during the drought of 1976. Rain that falls in the summer months is much less effective in replenishing the reservoirs because it is immediately absorbed by the dry ground and surrounding vegetation. &quot;We already know that any rainfall that we receive in the summer won&apos;t contribute to our natural recharge,&quot; said Veolia Water, which covers regions around London and in Kent. The seven water companies to introduce the hosepipe ban are Anglian Water, South East water, Southern water, Sutton and East Surrey water, Thames Water, Veolia Water Southeast and Veolia Water central. It is the most widespread of a series of measures being used to tackle the drought. When water levels become very low, water companies are forced to apply for drought permits from the Environment Agency, which allow them to take more water from source to refill depleted reservoirs. For many companies, it is the next step up from a hosepipe ban. A handful such permits have already been issued in the most stricken parts of the UK, including areas in Rutland and Surrey. The Environment Agency insist that they are not granted unless the water companies can prove they have taken other measure to reduce water use. Ian Johnson, head of water abstraction at the Environment Agency said: &quot;We only allow the water companies to abstract additional water for supplies if they can demonstrate that they are encouraging companies to use less water, reducing leakage, and we need to be confident that they&apos;ll not affect the health of the rivers or aquifers.&quot; Despite the news that river levels are as low as they were during 1976 drought, Johnson claimed there would not be a repeat of people queuing for standpipes in the street. &quot;&quot;The water supply arrangements are much better than they were,&quot; he said. &quot;While water companies may have to introduce some consumer restrictions it&apos;s really extremely unlikely that people will see similar scenes to those in 1976. Things have moved on since then.&quot; Under the hosepipe ban the public will be restricted from nonessential uses of water, including washing cars and boats, watering gardens and cleaning windows.",

    "text": "Ian Jack&apos;s discussion of social mobility (Phew! We don&apos;t need to worry about egalitarianism any more, apparently, 26 May) is interesting, as is his conclusion that, although &quot;hideously unfair&quot;, the selection for grammar school was (and is) probably less unfair than any other form of selection for advancement. However, like many commentators on the grammar school issue, Jack fails to take into account the way that the working of the 11-plus has changed over the years. My father took the test in the 1940s. He was bright, from a working-class background, and he might be described as a grammar school success story  good exam results, Oxford and a career as a university professor. By the time I came to take the test in the late 1960s, things had moved on. While my father simply turned up at school on the day of the test, my sister and I spent every day of our final year in our middle-class-dominated and aspirational primary school learning to pass the 11-plus. This training worked: against a national pass rate of 25% my school achieved approximately 75% success. Nowadays things are worse still: on top of the institutional coaching within primary schools in those areas that still have the 11-plus, those who can afford it pay for additional coaching. In other words, what was probably in the 1940s a straightforward test of innate ability has become a test of the quality of training that you can afford. Grammar schools may have delivered a degree of social mobility in the past, but aspirational middle-class parents of the 2010s are far too adept at manipulating the system to allow this to be the case now.Kath ChecklandHathersage, Derbyshire",

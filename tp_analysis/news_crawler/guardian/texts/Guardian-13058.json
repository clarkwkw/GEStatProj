    "text": "It&apos;s not just the scale of Oxford university&apos;s climate modeling experiment - the largest in the world, it says - but its interactive nature, that provides its value to researchers.  The climatepredication.net project, which has been going for a decade this year, harnesses the power of home computers across the world to help academics simulate thousands of years worth of data. This offers far greater computational power than would be available with even the biggest supercomputer.  Interested volunteers - all 30 odd thousand of them - feed back directly into the project, helping to shape the questions that drive its development.  &quot;Many participants prove to be dedicated contributors to our project in not only donating their spare computer time but also finding errors in the model quicker than we would ever be able to [and] suggest improvements,&quot; says Dr Friederike Otto, who works on climateprediction.net.  They also, she explains, &quot;provide highly valuable opinions on the feasibility of modeling approaches and ask scientific questions important for their everyday lives, getting us to consider research topics people throughout the world need answers for which are not necessarily identical to those we, as UK scientists, identified as most pressing.&quot; An interesting spin-off has been climateeducation.net, initially an online course in basic climate science, which has now has led to a second course - particularly welcomed by participants in South Asia and Africa - for practitioners who want to use the model&apos;s output to inform decisions on environmental planning and adaptation.",

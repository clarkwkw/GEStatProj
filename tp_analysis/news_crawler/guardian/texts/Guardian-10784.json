    "headline": "Fossil-fuelled Osborne flogs dead horse as green economy races away", 
    "text": "In attempting to whip the UK economy into action, George Osborne has donned flame-retardant blinkers and backed a fiery dash for gas and rush for roads whilst looking the gift horse of the fast-growing green economy in the mouth. The chancellor began his Autumn statement by naming rising commodity prices as a key reason for the UK&apos;s slowcoach performance in the global economic race. Yet, despite throwing billion after billion on infrastructure projects from roads to schools to laboratories, the sector best placed to speed ahead in an increasingly resource-constrained world remained virtually unbacked. The green economy is no longer the long-priced outsider only backed by the brave: it is worth 122bn a year - 8% of GDP - and grew at 4.7% in 2011, while employing almost a million people and delivering a trade surplus of 5bn a year. To get the British economy out of the starting gate, infrastructure projects have to be ready to go. Yet virtually nothing from the 5bn capital boost announced in the 2011 Autumn statement has yet materialised. Contrast that with the 294 flood defence projects that were shovel-ready and in line for funding before the coalition&apos;s budget cuts hit. The 120m Osborne produced for flood defences offsets just a small part of the hundreds of millions already cut, but every pound spent on flood defences saves eight in future damages and the risk is rising ever higher as the world warms. The chancellor is creating a new business bank with a billion to invest, yet has hamstrung the green investment bank (GIB) he already created by forbidding it to borrow until the national debt is falling. That will not now happen until 2016-17, Osborne admitted, meaning the estimated 100bn of investment the GIB could leverage is an ever-more distant prospect. The GIB is the only state bank in Europe that cannot borrow. Osborne was happy to forgo billions in tax revenue by abandoning a planned 3p rise in fuel duty, despite the coalition&apos;s promise to increase green taxes. However this move only prolongs the painful task of getting the nation of the oil hook and sharply contrasts with a decade of above-inflation rises in rail fares.  The 1bn he pledged for new roads was joined by 2bn for houses, 1bn for schools, 2.6bn for regional growth, 40bn in loan guarantees and more, all public money and all on the national balance sheet. Starkly missing from all this was any serious focus on the green measures that will future-proof the economy and could start tomorrow. The armies of tradesmen ready and waiting to transform the nation&apos;s ageing and draughty homes through energy efficiency, for example, are standing idle as the Green deal policy flounders.  The post-industrial centres outside the south-east could become world-leading renewable energy hubs, but rely on support from energy bills not public money as elsewhere in Osborne&apos;s infrastucture-boosting plans. As a result, they remain at the mercy of the ongoing war between the chancellor and energy secretary Ed Davey. &quot;We don&apos;t want British families and businesses to be left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the Atlantic,&quot; said Osborne, referring to the impact shale gas has had on the US energy market. But no serious analyst predicts the same fracking revolution for Europe or the UK. Instead, in the race to lead the global green market for low-carbon goods and services, currently worth 3.3 trillion a year, the chancellor wants to flog the dead horse of fossil fuels and leave the UK languishing at the back of the field.",

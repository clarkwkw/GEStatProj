    "text": "The interminable discussions continue about targets to replace the millennium development goals (MDGs) when they expire in 2015, but there is a gradual shift towards not just what the world should try to achieve, but how to go about it, known in the jargon as &quot;means of implementation&quot;. In large part, this comes down to where the money will come from, ie financing. The goals are set to be radical. There are two currents of thinking that are not yet set in stone but which would ensure that the financing decisions are also radical. First, rather than treating countries as finance-recipients, they need to be viewed as finance-generators. It is a common criticism of the MDG era that too much emphasis has been placed on aid. Instead, taxation and curbing illicit flows, present but largely forgotten in every major development financing document of the past 20 years, must finally be given precedence over foreign inflows of money. Second, and even more profoundly, the whole &quot;financing gap&quot; calculating model, whereby a particular outcome is costed and possible contributions totted up, is past its sell-by date. It has been the basis of much of the quantitative analysis behind the MDG era, and is also the thinking behind the simplified NGO stats that x billion dollars will result in y lives saved. But it depoliticises finance, which is  and should be  very political. Both themes emerged at a recent meeting in Johannesburg organised by the UN Millennium Campaign, where a group of African intellectuals and guests discussed how new development goals would be financed in Africa. The buzzwords were &quot;structural transformation&quot;. Rather than seeking cash from others to achieve development results, a profound economic restructuring is required to finance change that is both sustainable and equitable. Startling facts were presented, such as Christian Aid&apos;s discovery (pdf) that half of Zambia&apos;s copper was, on paper only, exported to Switzerland and sold at much higher prices  if Zambia could get the value Switzerland was getting, it would almost double its GDP. If all African countries raised just 15% of GDP in revenue, the continent&apos;s governments would have an additional $200bn (131bn) at their disposal annually. We were reminded by Professor Alioune Sall, who advises Liberia&apos;s President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, that there is half a trillion dollars sitting in private African banks but rendered impotent by ill thought out national legislation and lack of banker confidence. Crucially, the political and social attributes of different forms of finance need to be appreciated. Money is not just money. Treating all finance as equivalent, while it sounds sensible and certainly works on a spreadsheet, is divesting political decisions of their politics. National taxes are entirely different from foreign aid, for example. Consider the impact on democratic accountability when external actors and not the government are viewed as responsible for the delivery of public goods. And foreign direct investment (FDI) has different attributes to national bank loans. Policies promoting FDI for the extractives sector may lead to economic growth in many countries but not new jobs or poverty reduction. Breaking those categories down further, different types of tax (on income, mineral exports, consumption) have different consequences for national politics, especially on state accountability, which is now recognised almost universally as a key element in development progress. Developing countries are already twice as dependent on corporation tax as developed countries  is that a good thing or a bad thing? It cannot be treated simply as a neutral statement. But that is what the &quot;financing gap&quot; model does. In its apolitical bubble world, it doesn&apos;t matter where the money comes from, as long as it comes. If there are no tax revenues, increase aid  that will &quot;fill the gap&quot;. No mention that the incentives created by aid are different from those created by tax, and often quite perverse. In this world, market-driven financing such as FDI is treated as equivalent to public interest financing, such as aid. This simplistic analysis is most apparent in climate finance discussions in which an arbitrary figure of $100bn is said to be required to help developing countries adapt to and mitigate climate change, to come from private and public sources, but with no indication as to what proportion would come from each. Such considerations influenced the design of a major piece of research we are carrying out at the Overseas Development Institute, called Development Progress. It assesses concrete progress in countries across the developing world since 1990 (aligning with the MDG measurement period) and asks, how was this progress achieved? and, crucially, how was it financed? We have deliberately rejected a simplistic understanding of how finance operates, analysing country context, sources of finance, techniques used to translate money into action, and accountability of financial actors. Initial studies in Nepal (on a huge drop in maternal mortality) and Mongolia (on improvements in post-primary education) indicate that our findings will suggest a subtler approach to financial policy decisions.",

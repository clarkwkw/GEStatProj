    "text": "The observation hide at Carymarsh nature reserve is so well appointed that some enthusiasts have taken overnight provisions to be on hand for the dawn chorus  only to find they became the observers observed, as passing deer peered in through the window. But it was mid-afternoon when I was there with the light just fading. I heard the story of the small island on the lake ahead of us. A pair of swans flew in four years ago and produced three cygnets, two of which were taken by foxes. The parents left after four months. In subsequent years, single adults and cygnets have come in, and some pairings have been formed. One pair produced six eggs and sat on them for 30 days, nearly time for the young tohatch. An electric fence had been put up to keep foxes out, but then all six eggs disappeared, and directly afterwards a fox with six cubs was found to be living close by. As this may have been no more than coincidence, the case of the disappearing eggs remains unproven. But in any case it seemed good to build an island where swans might breed safely, and this year a pair nested there and produced four eggs. Through the cold, wet weather, they too sat on them for 30 days until the mother simply left, her departure just one of the many instances of discouragement brought about across the countryside by recent weather. From time to time she would return briefly to sit on the eggs, which otherwise lay as we could see them, abandoned to the elements. Over to the right, some movement in boggy ground led the eye to two Exmoor ponies. We picked our way round to where they were cropping the grass and creating a sward that will encourage wildflower growth. For supposedly wild creatures they seemed surprisingly glad of human company.",

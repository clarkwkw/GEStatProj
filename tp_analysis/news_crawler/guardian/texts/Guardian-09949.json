    "text": "&quot;1912 was an incredible year, marking the height of the Heroic Age of Exploration. Curiosity about Antarctica was at fever pitch, and between 1910 and 1914 five teams of intrepid explorers embarked on the greatest race of the era, to travel beyond the edges of the known world and conquer this last great frontier  &quot; This week on Science Weekly, Alok Jha meets Professor Chris Turney to explore his new book 1912: The Year The World Discovered Antarctica.  Alok is also joined by Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample to discuss a keynote speech on science policy by the UK&apos;s Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, in which he announced that the government would be investing 300m of new money in space science research over the next five years.  Speaking at the Royal Society on Friday, Osborne outlined eight areas of technology in which he wanted the UK to become a world leader. Ian also reports the discovery of lethal weapons made by humans up to 71,000 years ago in what is now South Africa. The small stone blades provide further clues about how Homo sapiens came to replace Neanderthals after spreading from Africa. Subscribe for free via iTunes to ensure every episode gets delivered.

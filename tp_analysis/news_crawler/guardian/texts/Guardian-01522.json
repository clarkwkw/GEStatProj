While technorati tripped over themselves to congratulate Mr. Morin on finessing the bad publicity, a number of concerned engineers e-mailed me noting that the data collection was not an accident. It would have taken programmers weeks to write the code necessary to copy and organize someone&apos;s address book. Many said Apple was at fault, too, for approving Path for its App Store when it appears to violate its rules.  As Bilton points out, dissidents are often approached by state security in disguise; getting access to their address books puts them at risk. These need better protection. Google&apos;s path is the right one. It&apos;s just going to hurt &gt;&gt; Technovia Ian Betteridge:   In other words, Google is going to start controlling Android more tightly by stealth: it will sell the best phones, with rapid, regular updates that its erstwhile-partners can&apos;t match. Within a few years, I fully expect Motorola to have overtaken Samsung as the number one Android vendor. And, what&apos;s more, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if Samsung hadn&apos;t forked Android and ended up producing its own Samsung-only variant, with its own App Store.  Platform wars, app stores and ecosystems &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans A set of 16 slides looking at the principal mobile ecosystems in play right now - and how they break down in various ways. The 9X Email Problem &gt;&gt; Andrew McAfee Broad-ranging and intriguing:   Gourville talks about the &apos;9X problem&apos;  &quot;a mismatch of 9 to 1 between what innovators think consumers want and what consumers actually want.&quot;1 The 9X problem goes a long way to explaining the tech industry folk wisdom that to spread like wildfire a new product has to offer a tenfold improvement over what&apos;s currently out there.  Still Fucking Hate Email &gt;&gt; MG Siegler On the persistent problem, and why it should be thought of more like tweets - not necessary to read - than must-read:   there&apos;s a problem with changing the mentality about email because most people don&apos;t get as much email as [venture capitalist Fred] Wilson or I do. So it just looks like we&apos;re complaining for being popular or something. BUT the fact of the matter is that as more and more of the world spends more time online, more and more people will feel email overload.  The Perpetual, Invisible Window Into Your Gmail Inbox &gt;&gt; Andy Baio at Wired Andy Baio:   since Gmail added OAuth support in March 2010, an increasing number of startups are asking for a perpetual, silent window into your inbox. I&apos;m concerned OAuth, while hugely convenient for both developers and users, may be paving the way for an inevitable privacy meltdown.  Will make you think twice about giving your approval to apps you haven&apos;t researched. Does Android fragmentation matter to Google? Not much &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans Writing for Enders Analysis:   Even the most fragmented, forked, customised and mangled &apos;Android&apos; device has an open web browser and data connectivity and can drive mobile use of Google Search. Indeed, saying that an Android device like the Kindle Fire &apos;has no Google services&apos; might be true in one sense but misses the underlying point  the browser itself is by far the most important Google Service on any device.  It&apos;s sometimes easy to forget that what Google wants is everyone using the net, because its gravity well there is so powerful. US&apos;s NOAA to drop BlackBerry for iPhone &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com This is very bad for RIM:   Joining the large crop of businesses and organizations dropping the BlackBerry, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plans to provide employees with Apple&apos;s iPhones and iPads instead. The government agency, based in Washington, cited the steep cost of Research in Motion&apos;s software, which is used to secure and manage BlackBerry devices, as the primary reason for the switch, which was first reported Thursday by The Loop. The agency has distributed about 3,000 BlackBerry devices among 20,000 workers, and plans to move to the Apple devices beginning in May.  If many more decide that BES is too expensive (as happened here), that becomes a serious risk for RIM&apos;s future business. Also: the NOAA is shifting to Google Apps; it tried Android but decided the Apple products were a better fit. MacBook Air with Windows 7 review: the ultrabook to rule them all? &gt;&gt; The Verge Joanna Stern has really smart idea: run Windows 7 on a MacBook Air via Parallels and Boot Camp.   The MacBook Air is simply best in class when it comes to hardware. The build is outstanding, the touchpad works better with Microsoft&apos;s operating system than any other laptop trackpad out there, and the display makes Windows look better than ever. All that combined with very snappy performance makes the Air more enjoyable to use than many of the other ultrabooks on the market, including the higher end $1,110 Asus Zenbook and the $1,200 Lenovo IdeaPad U300s.  It&apos;s expensive, and the battery life is worse. But it kicks all the others in the display and trackpad, Stern says. Social networks explained in one picture (includes &apos;donuts&apos; &gt;&gt; Douglas Wray We&apos;d prefer to call them doughnuts, but this is very witty. Phone size comparison made easy! &gt;&gt; phone-size.com Very neat - even if you don&apos;t do it life-size, you can compare the relative size of a huge number of phones.

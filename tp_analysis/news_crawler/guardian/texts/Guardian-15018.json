    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Iron Man 3 has you hurtling through procedurally generated levels that are different every go, splitting your time between low-level flight avoiding buses and lorries and soaring up to the sky to shoot down drones and evade incoming air traffic. It looks nice, even if the controls tend towards inaccuracy, and while the game&apos;s free, it doesn&apos;t want to stay that way, using numerous cheesy cash-milking devices, like &apos;repairing&apos; your suit after each level, a process that either takes 30 seconds or can be skipped by spending crystals. It feels shifty and dishonest, making you wish they&apos;d just charge an honest price rather than incessantly begging for change.",

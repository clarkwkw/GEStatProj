    "text": "I can&apos;t remember how  or even if  I celebrated my 35th birthday. I probably didn&apos;t tell anyone, drank abottle of red, got a bit melancholy and wondered where it had all gone so very wrong. The Golf GTI has a more positive outlook on life. For its 35th, it has been to the gym and come out fitter and looking more muscular. Hello, laydeez. This is a special birthday edition, with a sportier body kit and a few extra horses under the bonnet. To be honest, only a car nerd would probably notice the tweaks, the extra power and the slightly throatier engine note. Edition 35, they&apos;re calling it. Edition Midlife Crisis, I&apos;m calling it. Can it really be 35 years ago that the first GTI arrived? When Jim Callaghan was PM, Showaddywaddy were top of the pops, and 99% ofcurrent premiership footballers hadn&apos;t even been born? This sophisticated beast bears scant resemblance to that original little box of fun, though when you look atall the incarnations lined up, arranged generationally, you can seethe line of DNA running through, automotive evolution. This is clearly a much better car than the first, though 35 years ago might have been a better time for aGTI. The roads were emptier, there were fewer Gatso cameras, attitudes were different, and speed and power lesssocially unacceptable. We decide to test it out on a trip toDevon. Which involves sitting in astationary queue of traffic on the North Circular in London, then inslow-moving queues on the M4 and M5. We could be sitting in any Golf  it really wouldn&apos;t make any difference. Infact, the eco diesel model would be much better, because the needle on the fuel guage would be moving left less rapidly. We&apos;re paying extra simply for a more pleasing engine note. Eventually, after hours and hours of going almost nowhere, we leave the motorway. And suddenly, on carving West Country A roads, this car makes perfect sense. It sucks them in, like spaghetti, effortlessly. Refined, like a bigger car, but still small enough to feel like a hot hatch. And then, on narrower Devon lanes, steep and high-sided, more noodles than spaghetti, it&apos;s a rally car  roaring now, beams of xenon double-piercing the night, mud flying. Apologies to the VW press fleet people for the mess. And apologies to everyone else, too, because this kind of behaviour is almost certainly no longer allowed. Driving mustn&apos;t be enjoyable any more (luckily, it very rarely can be). It was a moment of midwinter madness. I was taken back, if not 35years, then to when I was 35. Noexcuses  well, apart from the obvious one: midlife crisis.

    "text": "ProfJohn Hagelin&apos;s decision not to run against Mitt Romney and Barack Obama left this year&apos;s US presidential race without a major candidate who is a scientist and who acknowledges  publicly  his ability to both counteract gravity and prevent crime. Two decades ago, Hagelin and a team of fellow scientists performed a bold experiment. Their aim was to drastically reduce the amount of violent crime in Washington DC  a metropolis then noted for its high incidence of murder, rape and robbery. The Hagelin method was to systematically blanket the city with mental emanations from transcendental meditation and yogic flying. Hagelin is, by his own admission, a remarkable man. A professor of physics and director of the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy at the Maharishi University of Management, in Fairfield, Iowa, he is a practised expert in quantum physics, transcendental meditation and yogic flying. Hagelin ran for president in 1992, 1996 and 2000, as the Natural Law Party&apos;s designated candidate. He was not elected in any of those years. In the election of 2000, he lost to George W Bush by only 50,372,288 votes and to Al Gore by 50,916,183 votes. The Natural Law Party, based at the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy, has since closed its national office. In 1993 Hagelin invented his crime-prevention recipe. His method consists of &quot;forming coherence groups in major cities to lower the stress throughout our society, in order to alleviate the prime cause of criminality&quot;. In plain words, he pays people to meditate, and levitate themselves off carpets. When a sufficient number of skilled people do this at the same time and in the same place, the crime rate drops. It&apos;s a simple as that. Hagelin demonstrated this anti-crime technique in the summer of 1993. From 7 June to 30 July, 4,000 trained meditators meditated and levitated in or near Washington DC. At a press conference the following year, just weeks before the presidential election, candidate Hagelin announced the results of the experiment: it was a success. While the meditators were meditating and levitating, Washington&apos;s crime rate dropped by 18%. This was a fact. The crime rate did drop by 18%. However, the rate that dropped by 18% was not the number of crimes actually committed  in fact, during the experiment, Washington&apos;s weekly murder count hit the highest level ever recorded. The 18% drop was from Hagelin&apos;s computer prediction of what would have happened had his meditators not been meditating and levitating. For his influence on criminals, John Hagelin was awarded the 1994 Ig Nobel Peace Prize.  Marc Abrahams is organiser of the Ig Nobel prizes and editor of the Annals of Improbable Research",

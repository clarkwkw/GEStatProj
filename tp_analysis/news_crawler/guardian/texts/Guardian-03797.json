    "text": "It&apos;s the news everyone who&apos;s seen the Avengers movie has been waiting for  there&apos;s a game tie-in coming. Well... kind of. Ubisoft has just announced Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth, set to launch on Xbox Kinect and the Nintendo Wii U in the autumn.  However, while the game is based around the characters from the hit film, there&apos;s no connection with the movie plot itself. Instead Battle For Earth follows the comic book&apos;s Secret Invasion storyline and is set to feature 20 different characters, including Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America and Thor, as well as a selection of other &quot;fan-favorite&quot; super heroes and super villains from the Marvel Universe. Development duties have gone to Ubisoft Quebec, previously responsible for PowerUp Heroes and the Black-Eyed Peas Experience as well as some work on the Assassin&apos;s Creed series. The emphasis will, of course, be very much on &quot;motion-controlled gaming&quot;. Possibly throwing Captain America&apos;s shield? Stamping on things and shouting &apos;Hulk mad!&apos;? Pretending to hit things with a hammer? Frankly the possibilities are limited. Sorry, limitless. The Avengers movie is rare in that it hasn&apos;t been accompanied by a direct game conversion  the recent Thor and Captain America flicks both received tie-ins courtesy of Sega. However, this is not a first  a loose adaptation of the Dark Knight movie was in development at EA&apos;s Pandemic studio, but the project was never released and the studio was closed in 2009. There will no doubt be more info on Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth at E3 next month...",

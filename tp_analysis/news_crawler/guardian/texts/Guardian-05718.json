    "text": "Davor Hebel, a Croatian-born and US-educated partner at Fidelity Growth Partners Europe, a 100m fund, is explaining where venture capital (VC) investors fit into London&apos;s technology ecosystem. It all boils down to the question of whether you back the jockey or the horse. Angel, &quot;seed&quot; or early-stage investors tend to back the jockey  the entrepreneurs themselves  in the knowledge that their idea will undergo a number of iterations before a winning formula is found. A VC, by contrast, usually takes a rather more cool-headed approach. Yes, he or she will assess the team&apos;s credibility, but ultimately they will back the horse. &quot;Not every company needs venture capital investment, of course,&quot; says Hebel. &quot;They can grow at a certain rate without us.&quot; He leans forward, flashing a Colgate smile, to emphasise his next point. &quot;But when you raise VC investment, the VC will want you to go for a huge exit  that&apos;s an exit of 100m plus. They will want you to hit the ball out of the park.&quot; There are three things you get used to if you spend time talking deals with VCs such as the affable Hebel. First, they talk in telephone-number sums. Even the European minnows (by comparison with Silicon Valley&apos;s breed of great whites) run funds comprising breathtaking amounts of cash. A fund of less than 100m is considered small  or in the words of one investor, &quot;boutique&quot;  while the biggest European players, such as Accel Partners, a global powerhouse that has backed both Facebook and Groupon, has a kitty of $1.5bn (946m) to invest in entrepreneurs on this side of the Atlantic. Second, technology venture capital in Europe is a very small world. Most of the VCs, who raise their own cash from pension funds and wealthy individuals or families, seem to know each other well. This is because they&apos;ve often scoped the same deals and worked the same rooms at events packed with twentysomething techies with promising businesses. Third, they pepper conversation with the word &quot;disrupt&quot;  as in: &quot;This company is going to disrupt the social gaming/alternative finance/pedigree pet-grooming world.&quot; And by &quot;disrupt&quot; they don&apos;t mean &quot;mildly unsettle&quot; or &quot;interrupt&quot;. They mean &quot;turn upside down&quot;. Arguably, however, it is the VCs themselves, alongside other investors, who are currently doing much of the disrupting. Eighteen months after the prime minister expounded, at a venue in Brick Lane, his vision for east London&apos;s transformation into a global technology hub, &quot;Tech City&quot;, as it is known to some, (&quot;Silicon Roundabout&quot; to others), is the scene of increasingly cut-throat competition between investors. The once familiar refrain that, compared with the US, talented startups with a breakout idea struggle to get capital investment in the UK is increasingly rarely heard. Indeed, the (bespoke, hand-sewn) shoe is now very much on the other foot: it is frequently the investors who must do much of the fawning and pitching. &quot;The best startups not only always get funded, but there is real competition to fund them from a growing number of angels, accelerators [growth hothouses] and VCs,&quot; says Robin Klein, venture partner at Index Ventures, whose out-of-the-ballpark UK investments include Lovefilm (acquired by Amazon for &quot;close to 200m&quot;), Mind Candy and TweetDeck (sold to Twitter for around 25m). &quot;The availability of capital here far exceeds that of any other European centre. London is now the European technology hub.&quot; Indeed, so intense is the competition for the outstanding startup ideas that VC investors are having to elbow their way in much earlier in the game. Where once they could leave the early stage or &quot;seed&quot; investing to friends and family (often derided as &quot;fools and family&quot;), tech incubators/accelerators and angels, today they have to scour tech networking events, meet-ups and demo days (at which startups pitch their businesses) to catch entrepreneurs before they have proven business models  or else risk missing out on the next Facebook or Wonga. &quot;This is because the costs to get tech companies up and running are decreasing,&quot; explains Tom Hulme, design director of IDEO and angel investor in GoCardless and retail &quot;gamification&quot; platform Fantasy Shopper. &quot;Startups can use cloud services to scale [up] or can tap into social networks to market [themselves]. So whereas VCs used to have to wait until businesses were bigger, you see a lot starting to invest at an earlier stage.&quot; One such firm is Mangrove Capital Partners, a Luxembourg-based 100m (80m) fund, which focuses on Europe and emerging markets. Its VCs invest before a product launch and, if viable, follow up with further backing (totalling 15-20m) later. &quot;We want to build up a reasonable stake in companies at an early stage because that allows us to have success in our funds,&quot; says Mangrove partner Michael Jackson, formerly chief operating officer of Skype. &quot;The mathematics of our funds mean we need generally large companies to be created reasonably fast. Typically, we invest in between 30 and 50 companies per fund, of which we&apos;re hoping one will be fantastic.&quot; Jackson explains that the best small funds (&quot;typically 50-200m&quot;) have all had one or two large successes. &quot;If one company is going to pay back, say, a 100m fund, which is what we all dream of, it means the VC has to have 10% of a billion-dollar company when it&apos;s sold for it to work. What tends to happen if you have 30 companies is that you have one success, if you&apos;re lucky, which puts the whole thing into profit and then you have two or three others that do pretty well as well, which delivers some solid extra returns for people who invest in us.&quot; The investors vying for a slice of the action, high valuations and acquisitions such as Facebook&apos;s $1bn (as yet uncompleted) purchase of photo-sharing service Instagram  especially when set against Europe&apos;s struggling &quot;real&quot; economies  have led some to speculate that we are in the throes of another dotcom bubble. But that theory finds little sympathy from VCs such as Klein, who says that, unlike 2000  the year of the last dotcom crash  the fundamentals of the tech boom are very strong indeed. &quot;Internet adoption continues to grow and smartphones accessing the web means that many more people have access for longer periods and in different situations. Building companies has never been cheaper. Platforms such as Facebook, iPhone and Android are facilitating wide, global distribution; Google gives consumers easy access via search to goods and services; and technology becomes simpler and more intuitive every day.&quot; Pointing to his portfolio of companies, he says: &quot;We are seeing 50%-plus year-on-year growth. Clearly this is not happening in other parts of the economy.&quot;",

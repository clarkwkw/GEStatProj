    "text": "This week&apos;s Science Weekly is dedicated to an extended interview with Mark Pagel, a fellow of the Royal Society and head of the Evolutionary Biology Group at the University of Reading.  Mark has just published his latest book Wired for Culture: The Natural History of Human Cooperation which explores the diversity of language and culture around the world from an evolutionary perspective. There will be no podcast next week as we prepare for a special Science Weekly Live which will be released on Monday 2 April.

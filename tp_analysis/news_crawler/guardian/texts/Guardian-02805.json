    "text": "Xbox owners  did you picture yourselves making the most of the late spring sunshine this year? Whole days spent in the park, catching up on those George R.R. Martin books you got for Christmas? Perhaps a few jaunts to the coast? A hike or two maybe? Right, forget all that, you&apos;re going nowhere. Yesterday Microsoft announced its latest season of major Xbox Live Arcade releases. The action will kick off on 18 April with the idiotically addictive Trials Evolution (for 1200 Microsoft points), before moving on to the Frank Miller-inspired hack-n-slasher, Bloodforge (25 April, 1200 points) and the colourful and lovely Fable Heroes (2 may, 800 points).  The promotion ends with the much anticpated console translation of Minecraft on 9 May. It&apos;ll come in at slightly more expensive 1600 Microsoft points, but offers four-player splitscreen and online multiplayer, as well as a clever new crafting system and tutorial aid for those who haven&apos;t spent the last year building reproductions of the Taj Mahal in the PC version. There&apos;s some other interesting news too. From April, XBLA titles will be offering not 200 but 400 gamer points, as well as up to 30 Achievements. It&apos;s a tacit acknowledgement of the fact that certain digital releases have offered more depth and longevity than many full-price retail titles.  So yes, any of those interest you?",

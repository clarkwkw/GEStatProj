    "text": "Your correspondents warn the government that there are 50 months to avoid climate disaster (Letters, 1 October). But the dramatic collapse of Arctic sea ice this year presages disaster much sooner. It demonstrates the alarming progression of a vicious cycle: as the sea ice melts away, it is replaced by open water, absorbing sunshine and warming the sea such as to speed the melt. This vicious cycle became apparent in the 90s, when observations of the sea ice extent started deviating from linear projections. Annual sea ice minimum volume is showing a clear trend towards zero in September 2015  an ice-free ocean. Scientists warn that this year&apos;s weather extremes, and mounting food prices, are due to Arctic warming and therefore liable to worsen progressively in future years as the sea ice disappears. Ameg, the independent policy group that I chair, argues that the only way to avoid such a crisis is to cool the Arctic. We need to start deploying cooling technology within five months if we are to prevent further sea ice retreat. This is a colossal engineering challenge, and governments must collaborate to ensure it is met. We must avert a crisis that could bring famine to all within a few years.John NissenLondon  Polly Toynbee and Danny Dorling illustrate on the same page (Comment, 2 October) the perils of forgetting what US physicist Al Bartlett has called the &quot;forgotten fundamentals&quot; of growth. Thus Dorling calls for &quot;low growth&quot;, but a rate of just 1% would produce a doubling of a given quantity in a mere 70 years. Toynbee even talks of the &quot;sunny uplands of 3% growth&quot;. The doubling time would be correspondingly shorter (just over 23 years). Such &quot;growthism&quot; is no longer sustainable. This year&apos;s Earth &quot;overshoot day&quot; has already gone (12 August), earlier than ever before. That is why we greens argue that a quite different agenda is needed: a steady-state economy, one no bigger than the Earth can sustain.Sandy IrvineNewcastle Green party",

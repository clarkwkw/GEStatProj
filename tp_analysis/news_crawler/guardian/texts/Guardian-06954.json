    "text": "Continuity can greatly benefit serial fiction but, unfortunately, the Kingdom Hearts series has, over time, become overly mired in its long-form narrative. This latest Disney-cum-Final Fantasy mash-up sends heroes Sora and Riku through various animated worlds to master mythical Keyblade weapons. Die-hards will no doubt be riveted, though newcomers will be utterly bewildered by the convoluted  and some would say contrived  saga that unfolds. Thankfully, the varied gameplay makes Dream Drop Distance still worth investing in. The introduction of &quot;flowmotion&quot;, a parkour-like way of navigating the world at speed, makes battles considerably more dynamic, bouncing between enemies to perform special moves. Camera angles can be tricky to follow, though locking on to foes helps. Levelling up is a by-numbers RPG grind, though new skills are unlocked through a charming virtual pet system  an appreciably innovative touch, as is the &quot;Dive Mode&quot; mini-game used to journey between worlds.",

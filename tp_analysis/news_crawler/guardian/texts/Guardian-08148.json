    "text": "George Osborne&apos;s plan to try to win support for an extra runway in south-east England, possibly at Heathrow, by establishing a special commission, has come under attack from his own party. The Conservative London mayor, Boris Johnson, described the idea of a commission as a &quot;disaster&quot;, according to the BBC. Zac Goldsmith, the environmentalist who was elected Tory MP for Richmond Park in 2010, said he would not stand for the party again unless it ruled out a third runway at Heathrow. The row broke out after the chancellor said on Sunday he favoured an extra runway, which could be built at Heathrow, and would seek a cross-party consensus to back the controversial move. A commission, modelled on the Browne review on university tuition fees, could be established to build a consensus. The Liberal Democrats have agreed to the commission  the coalition agreement only rules out an extra runway for the south-east in this parliament. But it is understood Osborne wants to give the Tories a chance of supporting an extra runway at the next election. Goldsmith told Radio 4&apos;s World at One: &quot;If we enter the next election with a manifesto which does not rule out expansion of Heathrow, I think the Conservative party would be very badly defeated in areas beneath the flightpath. I personally would not want to stand as a Conservative candidate on a manifesto that is ambiguous on this issue.&quot; He added: &quot;The arguments that are put forward in favour of Heathrow expansion are based on wild exaggerations. Heathrow is already one of the busiest airports in the world.&quot; Asked about Osborne&apos;s decision to support an extra runway, he said: &quot;I think that is wrong. Take Stansted, which is only half-used at the moment: very well positioned but very bad rail links. If you improved the rail links to Stansted it would be the obvious place for people flying for business reasons into London Expansion has to be the last solution.&quot;",

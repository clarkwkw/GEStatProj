    "text": "If CLARITY had been devised 15 years ago, my life as a PhD student would have been much, much easier. I was trying to understand how migrating cerebellar granule cells find their way through the developing chicken brain. This involved dissecting hundreds of tiny brains from chick embryos into slices and labeling some of the cells with a fluorescent dye. I&apos;d incubate the slices for a week or so and embed them in a gel. Then, I&apos;d use a machine called a microtome to shave each one into dozens of sections, each thinner than a human hair, mount those onto glass slides and, finally, examine them with a confocal fluorescence microscope.  Tissue sectioning is a time-consuming and laborious process. Once the solidified gel has been glued to the microtome platform, the vibrating blade moves back and forth across it slowly, moving down one microscopic step at a time, to cut a series of sections from one end of the slice to the other. Each section has to be carefully removed with a paintbrush as it comes loose, and then mounted onto a glass microscope slide. CLARITY does away with all this, by making samples of biological tissue completely transparent.The method, developed by Kwanghun Chung of Stanford University and his colleagues, is described today in the journal Nature. The first step is to inject the tissue with formaldehyde and hydrogels. The formaldehyde cross-links all the molecules inside it, apart from the fats, to each other and to the hydrogel. When heated to body temperature, the tissue and hydrogel harden together to form a hybrid mesh. The fats, which scatter light and blur microscope images, can then be cleared away by applying an electrical current across the tissue sample.            The whole process takes four or five days. The &apos;clarified&apos; tissue is not only transparent but also retains its original three-dimensional structure, and is permeable to large molecules, so it can be treated with fluorescently-labelled antibodies that label specific proteins or other types of molecular probes. It is also resilient enough to be washed and then stained a second time with other molecular probes, which would be very useful to studying rare tissue samples. The researchers demonstrated the method on the mouse brain and on small blocks from the frontal lobe of an autistic patient, which had been preserved in a brain bank for more than 6 years. Using various probes, they labelled specific types of neurons in both, and traced the routes of their fibres throughout the samples. The ability to do so on intact brains rather than two-dimensional tissue slices makes the method particularly useful for visualising neural pathways over long distances.  CLARITY can be used on any kind of tissue from any organism, so it could lend itself to many different applications, but seems particularly amenable to developmental studies. Embryonic development involves mass movements of cells not only in the brain but also other parts of the embryo, which requires complex interactions between the cells and their surroundings. Embryos are, of course, three dimensional, so many of these processes are hard to reproduce in experiments on tissue slices. Using CLARITY, developmental biologists can now study them as they occur in their natural environment.  Reference: Chung, K., et al. (2013).

    "text": "The solstice passed in a grey blur, so while the crawl towards spring is theoretically under way it&apos;s been hard to tell. Today, however, has dawned clear and, before the next band of cloud pushes up from Staffordshire, I&apos;m sploshing across Ramsley Moor in bright sunshine. The south-west margins of Sheffield have several wild, unvisited corners and Ramsley is one of my favourites. Tucked below a major road that divides it from the bleak splendour of Big Moor, its birch, willow and alder scrub and marshy ground offer a refuge for all kinds of creatures. You&apos;ll see shrike here, warblers and spotted flycatchers, and that tiny finch, the redpoll. Most summers I hear a cuckoo, oddly thrilling so close to the city. On the heather moor there are adders and lizards, if you know where to look. Off-road motorcyclists too, more&apos;s the pity, chewing up the bridleways. In the recent heavy rain, these have turned to a quagmire, and so I veer off the track into thick birch woods. Soon I find myself among hummocks of sphagnum, squinting towards Shillito Woods where the low morning sun hovers above the ridgeline. The light here is exquisite, soft and buttery and holding a little warmth now I&apos;m sheltered from the strong breeze pushing across the hollow of the moor. Long shadows stretch out from the birches. The moss is a vibrant lime, as though it were lit from within. After days of rain, I find myself standing straight and lifting my face to the sun. No one can be blithe with the days so short, but on a clear winter&apos;s day, with the shadows so long in the middle of the day, I take a valedictory pleasure in the moment, knowing it can&apos;t last long. Like every other creature on Ramsley, we have our requirements for surviving short days and cold temperatures; these moments of reprieve in the long winter reveal, for me, more about our own natures than any other time of year. These days we find the warmth we need in centrally heated homes, or as migrants flying south to where the sun&apos;s angle is loftier. But the &quot;symptoms&quot; we experience in a northern winter  a stronger appetite, an unwillingness to get out of bed  seem to me good strategies for survival, and sufficiently rehearsed across the centuries to become second nature. Ramsley isn&apos;t noted for its archaeological sites but up the hill and across the road is a striking stone circle on the eastern fringe of Big Moor. I remember, a couple of years ago on a colder day than this, finding a small plastic Viking warrior settled carefully in a small hollow next to one of the stones. Asanoffering it seemed oddly appropriate, a vague nod to earlier times, when such notions of survival weren&apos;t so whimsical.",

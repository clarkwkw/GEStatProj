Its retina display has 1 million more pixels than a large-screen HDTV. The new A5X chip has, according to Apple, four times the processing power of Nvidia&apos;s Tegra 3 chip. Compared with iPad 2, it has a nicer camera, a video camera, dictation input, and 4G, while still squeezing out 10 hours of (Wi-Fi) battery life. It&apos;s a wee bit thicker and an ounce heavier. And yet, in my conversations with numerous reporters over the past few days, the theme they kept bringing up was &quot;incremental innovation&quot;: Will the next iPad be innovative enough to maintain Apple&apos;s momentum? If the iPhone 4S is a case study, the answer for consumers is a resounding &quot;yes.&quot;   Sort of puts the &quot;iPad 2S&quot; jokes into context. Apple&apos;s iOS runs HTML5 games three times faster than Android | VentureBeat  The platforms that run HTML5 faster are likely to have an advantage in running a whole new wave of applications and games. So Spaceport.io, the cross-platform mobile game development tool maker, ran a study to find out whether iOS (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) is faster than Android at running HTML5 games. Hands-down, iOS won.   &quot;Android&quot; in this case being the Samsung Galaxy Nexus (which got the top mark of the Android devices tested), and &quot;iPhone&quot; being the iPhone 4S. Browsing behavior in February: Internet Explorer and Chrome down, Firefox up &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  This means that Firefox is retaining a slender lead over Google&apos;s browser. Last month we speculated that the halt in Chrome&apos;s growth might be related to Google&apos;s decision to penalize Chrome&apos;s positioning in its search results due to an advertising campaign that contravened Google&apos;s rules. The sixty day penalty will expire in the next few days, restoring Chrome&apos;s prominent positioning in Google searches.   Get your diaries out and watch for those Chrome ads. BitTorrent pirates go nuts after TV release groups dump Xvid &gt;&gt; TorrentFreak  From February 22nd and earlier in some cases, release groups including ASAP, BAJSKORV, C4TV, D2V, DiVERGE, FTP, KYR, LMAO, LOL, MOMENTUM, SYS, TLA and YesTV began releasing TV shows in the new format. Out went Xvid and avi, in came x264 and MP4.   The scene is set. (By the way, calling them &quot;release groups&quot; is clever spin. Makes it sound like the TV episodes are being kept in cages too small to turn around in.)   However, while the release groups want to move with the times, there are many people consuming their content who either don&apos;t or can&apos;t. In the main, people seem disappointed because their standalone Xvid compatible DVD players won&apos;t play the new releases. Some of the reactions are polite enough, but show a misunderstanding of how the system works... At worst, some of the comments show an embarrassing sense of entitlement and an attitude that those downloading for free are actually &quot;customers&quot; of these release groups and as such deserve to be treated better.   An &quot;embarrassing sense of entitlement&quot; among people illicitly downloading content for free? We&apos;re shocked, shocked. A story about an iPad browser that never was &gt;&gt; Geek &amp; Mild  It was May or June of 2010 (I can&apos;t remember exactly) and we were loving our brand new iPads ... except for the web browser, Safari. While advancements had been made in terms of its speed, we felt it still lacked in features and experience implementation - or UI. So we had the brilliant idea to make a new browser for the iPad.   See if you can figure out why it&apos;s not available before you click through. iPad 3 4G Teardown &gt;&gt; iFixit Oh my god - it&apos;s full of battery. Search behavior of iPad users in Russia &gt;&gt; Yandex  According to Yandex.Metrica, by the end of January 2012, at least one million of all online visitors to websites in the Russian internet4 were iPad users. More than 700,000 of them were from Russia. The iPad was officially released in Russia in November 2010. By that time, several tens of thousands of iPads were already in use in the country. In early 2011, their number exceeded 100,000 and then it increased six times during the year. Over the same period, the number of both mobile phone users and PC users also went up, but the progress was significantly slower than the growth in the number of iPad users - the number of mobile phone users increased 2.5 times, while the number of PC users grew only 1.4 times.

    "text": "This week, Aleks Krotoski meets web pioneer Ted Nelson. Way back in 1960, Nelson conceived a world-wide electronic publishing system capable of acting as a repository for all human knowledge, with links that allowed users to navigate between documents  which he dubbed &quot;hypertext&quot;. But the ill-fated Project Xanadu, as it was called, was in development for 40 years. Aleks talks to Nelson about Xanadu, his opinions of the world wide web, and what he&apos;s working on now.  And Charles Arthur speaks with John Cameron from Orbitsound, the maker of TV soundbars, about transforming home entertainment systems.  Finally, we hear the latest news from the world of technology",

    "text": "Recently, 2D motocross trials games have become a thriving breed. For those unfamiliar with the form, if you imagine that you are navigating a Super Mario level on a motorbike you&apos;ll not be too far wrong. Urban Trial Freestyle brings that experience to the PlayStation platforms, and like most of these games gives the player very basic controls. Granted the ability to accelerate, brake and move their bodyweight forward or back, the player must edge their way over numerous ramps, jumps and looping tracks. Urban Trial Freestyle and its apocalyptic city settings admittedly does little to innovate, but it is a solidly built game, well worth the download fee for fans or, indeed, newcomers to the genre.",

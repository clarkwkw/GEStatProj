    "text": "Social news site Reddit has been courting influential Silicon Valley investors as part of a funding round that values the company at $400m, TechCrunch reports. Exploiting a boost in its profile after President Obama held a Q&amp;A on the site  and in the wake of the outing of controversial online poster violentacrez  Reddit is reported to be limiting the investment round to just $1m, instead courting the allegiance of the tech industry&apos;s most exclusive angel investors. Reddit is owned by publishing giant Cond Nast, which owns titles including Vogue and Vanity Fair, through parent company Advance Publications, and was spun out as a standalone company in 2011 with $20m funding in the bank. With a small staff of fewer than 50 and income generated by advertising and subscriptions, the site is still thought to have around $18m of that money in the bank, reported AllThingsD. Reddit has built a cult following, recording 400 million unique visitors in 2012 while its October page views doubled year on year to 3.8bn. Reddit&apos;s chief executive, Yishan Wong, joined the company in March to help the company control its own finances, but some users have been sceptical, believing he may sacrifice the site&apos;s prized anonymity to increase targeted advertising.",

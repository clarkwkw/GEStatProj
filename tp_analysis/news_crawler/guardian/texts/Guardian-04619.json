We believe there are very sound environmental reasons for doing both. At Walshaw, we have now entered into a 25-year agreement that provides improved environmental protection for the moors while allowing the estate to conduct its business activities. The benefits of the agreement are significant. For the first time, burning activities on the Walshaw Estate will be subject to specific controls. The agreement sets restrictions on the maintenance and creation of infrastructure and an active programme of peat re-wetting has also been agreed, so that blanket bog restoration can take place. This is a significant step in improving environmental protection and the conservation status of the site, and we are pleased that we have been able to reach this stage through a negotiated agreement. Sadly, our Vital Uplands document had never been supported by the main land managers in the uplands, and a vision without followers cannot deliver outcomes for the natural environment. Far from abandoning the uplands, we are focused on forging the day-to-day partnerships that can achieve practical results. We are reviewing our uplands evidence and reinvigorating the uplands burning group to share evidence and develop best practice. We have an uplands director in place to co-ordinate and lead on our uplands work. Only agreed, co-ordinated action will secure the environment of the uplands, and we make no apologies for the pragmatic approach we are taking.Andrew WoodExecutive director, Natural England George Monbiot has hit the spot again. Natural England has been emasculated and, as part of the &quot;Defra family&quot;, it has also apparently been told not to get in the way of landowners and other government bodies. Here in the New Forest national park (another site of special scientific interest), Natural England is allowing the Forestry Commission and others to carry out damaging &quot;wetland restoration&quot; works at the Latchmore Brook and elsewhere, without any scientific assessment of its desirability or consequences. The public body responsible for protecting the natural environment has been shackled. Beware: your favourite &quot;protected&quot; places may be next ...Professor John ShepherdChair, Friends of Latchmore George Monbiot notes how the landed classes increase their holdings while the rest of us pay them to do so. Wouldn&apos;t it be better to reverse the flow of cash so that the landowners pay us for their privileges? That could happen if annual land rental values were to become the prime source of public revenue, with a corresponding reduction in taxation on labour, enterprise and investment. The mere &quot;owning&quot; of land is economically neutral; only when labour and capital are introduced is wealth created. It is ludicrous to persist with destructive taxes on the active factors of production while landowners who, per se, contribute nothing, are allowed to live off the proceeds of others&apos; efforts. Land has no production cost  it was already there. Its value is publicly generated as an indicator of public demand for a finite resource, and ought to be recycled into the public purse. We can&apos;t achieve a more equitable distribution of land by arbitrary confiscation and reallocation, but we can remove the driving force behind land monopoly. Surplus land would be released, while those who claim to own the country would find themselves paying its running costs.John DigneyAberfoyle, Stirling If George Monbiot&apos;s account of Richard Benyon&apos;s departmental actions were describing an emergent African nation or a post-Soviet state, there would be outraged cries about cronyism and implied corruption. Because, of course, it doesn&apos;t happen here.J OldakerNuneaton, Warwickshire George Monbiot is absolutely right (Our countryside has become a playground for the rich, 5 June), but it wouldn&apos;t be possible without the willing connivance of the not-so-rich  the rich aren&apos;t beaters. The increase in shooting over the past 10 years has been obvious to the casual observer and offensive to the regular walker. On a number of occasions last winter, shooters and beaters attempted to stop me using public footpaths in the Cotswolds because &quot;there was shooting going on&quot;. I ignored their attempts and made it quite clear that they were the offenders, not me. In December and January the volume of shooting becomes so intensive that walking becomes a chore rather than a pleasure, and I find myself wishing the time away and glad when February arrives. Last winter the end of the shooting season didn&apos;t end on the last day but continued the following day when the excuse was that it was &quot;clean-up day&quot;. One problem I have is that shooting a pheasant requires very little skill. On the average walk I could easily pick up a dozen pheasants and stuff them in my pockets because they&apos;re so dozy. I can only conclude that, dozy as they are, they still hold the intellectual advantage over the average hunter. The possession of a 12-bore distorts the situation and the sound of its regular discharge ruins the countryside for those of us who love it for the right reasons.Rod WhiteUley, Gloucestershire",

    "text": "Universities are often seen as places of privilege, and this can sometimes set up tensions between students and the surrounding community. The De Montfort University campus borders on an area facing a range of social challenges, and the contrast between the two has given rise to an initiative called the Square Mile project.  Thousands of local residents of the area now known as the &apos;Square Mile&apos; were asked to identify issues affecting their lives. The university then worked with its students and academics to tailor solutions using the resources and expertise they could bring to the problem.  Three examples from many include the university&apos;s audiology department testing the hearing of over 100 people, with many referred to specialists for treatment; an initiative to get internet access into the homes of the 60% of Square Mile residents who had none; and a project to help Year Six pupils improve their maths and money skills and introduce them to university life.  Square Mile is predominantly run on the goodwill of students and academics who volunteer their time beyond lectures and studies to work on initiatives linked to their specialism, but it&apos;s bottom up, not top down. Project director James Gardner observes that Square Mile&apos;s success to date stems from ideas being generated in the community the university wants to serve.  &quot;Unlike many university community projects, Square Mile has actively engaged with the majority of residents and built project ideas around their real needs and desires, rather than basing projects on what the university wanted to contribute,&quot; he explains &quot;At a time when many institutions and local authorities are cutting back on spending, DMU is investing its intellectual capital in the community on its doorstep and seeing remarkable results.&quot;",

    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view The NeoGeo was a 90s games console famous for its staggering, arcade-style graphics and games that cost 150 a pop. NeoGeo X is a portable version of the console with 20 built-in games, a premium-feeling ridgy rubber back, a remarkably solid joystick and a pale-looking widescreen display that leaves games looking oddly stretched  though they can be returned to their original format after loading each one. It also comes with a charging dock that lets you plug it into your TV and an arcade stick that&apos;s every bit as useful as its ancient forebear. There are classics among the bundled games, including The King of Fighters &apos;95 and Metal Slug, the quintessential run-and-gun game. You&apos;ll find yourself spending less time with the awful Cyber Lip or Nam 1975, and the previously excellent Magician Lord suffers without a save function. There are more games coming in April, while a separate joystick for two-player action further improves this gaming curate&apos;s egg.",

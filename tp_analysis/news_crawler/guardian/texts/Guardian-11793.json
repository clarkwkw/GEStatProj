    "headline": "Why funding higher education is still a very good bet for the UK treasury", 
    "text": "Two years on from the coalition government&apos;s decision to increase fees and revamp the system for students and universities in England, the funding of higher education remains a matter of heated debate in the UK. As yet there is no political consensus about the scale, scope and delivery of public investment but there should be a clear evidence base of the economic outcomes of higher education. This is why million+ has partnered with the consultancy firm London Economics to review the higher education balance sheet. What&apos;s the value of a degree?  the first in a series  investigated the overall economic costs and benefits of investment in higher education to the treasury, taxpayer and graduates. The report also examined the economic consequences of lower levels of participation in higher education in 2012 arising from the transition to the new funding system in England. Using official data, including the Labour Force Survey, we view the findings as unequivocal. They also mirror those of the OECD which concluded in 2010 that &quot;public investments in education, particularly at tertiary level are rational even in the face of running a deficit in public finances (they) yield significant returns and improve public finances in the longer term.&quot; So what is the value of a UK degree? Once all the costs to the public purse are taken into account, this report calculates that the net benefit to the treasury of financing an undergraduate degree is 94,000  equivalent to a rate of return of 10.8%. Even in a downturn, this suggests that funding higher education remains an exceptionally good bet for the treasury. Over a lifetime (and with all costs taken into account), an individual can expect to earn on average an additional 115,000 at today&apos;s prices. The lifetime graduate earnings premium for men is approximately 128,000. On the face of it, the additional premium for women is lower, standing at 87,000, mainly owing to career breaks  though no doubt influenced by gender pay inequality. However, the improvement in earnings of women with a degree compared to women without, is greater than for their male equivalents. A postgraduate qualification increases the earnings potential over a lifetime by an additional 59,000. At a time of uncertainty, it&apos;s also worth noting that graduates are 3% more likely to be employed, over their working life, and do much better overall than those who start work with A-level or other Level 3 qualifications. The total value to the treasury of the additional qualifications which one cohort of full-time and part-time undergraduates is likely to achieve, is calculated, based on 2010/11 enrolments. Over these students&apos; working lives, the total value to the treasury of this one cohort gaining higher education qualifications is a staggering 28.4bn in today&apos;s money. Based on an estimate of 75,000 of these UK-domiciled graduates achieving postgraduate qualifications in the future, the treasury will benefit by a further 4.6bn. There are further economic gains arising from higher education investment in the UK. These include export earnings of over 8.78bn per annum  a benefit likely to be at risk from changes in visa regulations. There are positive within firm spillover effects of graduates working alongside less qualified workers which are often forgotten. Enhanced wage levels at regional level linked to an increase in the number of graduates in the local labour market should also be factored in. Once looked at in this way, the downturn in applications to study at universities in England in 2012 takes on a new and worrying perspective. Those who say that the treasury will gain as a result of having to fund fewer fee and maintenance loans and grants are correct  but only in the short-term. If 30,000 fewer students participate in higher education in 2012 (a conservative estimate given UCAS figures that there are over 51,000 fewer full-time acceptances), the loss to the treasury will be in the order of 2.4bn in today&apos;s money. But there will be other costs too  and these will add-up if participation continues to decline or hovers at 2012 levels. If the yearly cohort of first-time students in England is reduced by 30,000 the aggregate costs of this decline in participation in higher education would be at least 6.6bn per student cohort. Studying for a degree can be transformative for individuals and people do not choose to study at university simply for economic returns. At a time of austerity governments also face difficult choices about investment priorities and questions are sometimes raised about the merits of educating more graduates. The jury is no longer out. In spite of difficult economic times, a UK degree remains an exceptionally good investment for both the individual undertaking the qualification as well as for the treasury and by default, the taxpayer. Now we need ministers to promote the value of higher education in its widest sense.

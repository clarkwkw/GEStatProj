    "text": "A quick burst of 7 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Kim Scheinberg&apos;s answer to: Apple Inc.: How does Apple keep secrets so well? &gt;&gt; Quora Amazing story. The finish:   I&apos;ve lost track of the many reasons that have been given for the switch to Intel, but this I know for sure:  No one has ever reported that, for 18 months, Project Marklar existed only because a self-demoted engineer wanted his son Max to be able to live closer to Max&apos;s grandparents.   Quora, proving its worth. Google founders slated for questions in antitrust probe &gt;&gt; Bloomberg (That&apos;s &quot;slated&quot; as in &quot;scheduled for&quot;, not &quot;slagged off&quot;.)   Plans for the depositions [of Larry Page and Sergey Brin] come as the Federal Trade Commission speeds up its antitrust probe of operator of the world&apos;s most popular internet search engine. Jon Leibowitz, the agency&apos;s chairman, said June 6 that he expects to complete the investigation by the end of the year. The FTC will then decide whether to sue Google.   By which time Google will hope to have finished dealing with the European Commission&apos;s antitrust investigation. Android updates embarrassing, but do users notice? &gt;&gt; CNET News Danny Sullivan:   What exactly was I missing by the operating system being so old? Nothing, really. The phone did just as much as my top-of-the-line Galaxy Nexus. It did just as much as my top-of-the-line iPhone 4S, for that matter. Sure, the pictures and video were lower-resolution, though not that remarkably noticeable. Aside from that, it wasn&apos;t like I was struggling to carry on my mobile life as normal.  That&apos;s the reality check that can go missing when looking at update figures. People are clearly still able to use their phones despite not having the latest version of Android.  In Russia, Yandex gets ousted as default search option in Firefox &gt;&gt; The Next Web  The commercial agreement between Mozilla and Yandex is notably set to expire on the 31st of December 2012, which begs the question: why was Yandex ousted in favor of Google in the most recent Russian-language Firefox browser build way before that date?  For the record, Mozilla wasn&apos;t contractually bound to keep Yandex as the default search option in the Russian Firefox build - but still, why the change?   The Firefox change was done as a bugfix. Neat. Apple&apos;s hardware &quot;dilemma&quot; &gt;&gt; counternotions  As the proverbial design adage goes, &quot;People don&apos;t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.&quot; Non-geeks, Apple&apos;s primary audience, aren&apos;t interested in what the hardware is, but how the product solves their specific problems. Hence they buy on demonstrable value, rather than on potential of hardware specs.  But Apple detractors ask why should the most valuable technology company on the planet -- with a large patent portfolio, unrivaled in-house industrial design capabilities and enormous influence over its supply chain and component pricing -- fail to offer the best hardware specs in the industry for its premium products? There are a few basic reasons why Apple doesn&apos;t believe it&apos;s in a hardware race.   A post that gets better as you keep reading.&apos; Mapping the Google exodus &gt;&gt; deCarta A counterpoint to Google&apos;s new moves in mapping announced last week:   Much has been written in the last month1 about the exodus of developers from Google Maps, partly as a result of Google&apos;s plan to charge high volume users and partly a result of terms that make the &quot;Free-ness&quot; of those maps a little less free.  Here at deCarta, we are seeing the effects. In the last 90 days, we have had 488 new companies sign up on the deCarta DevZone and start working with our offerings. Our DevZone has been supporting developers for about seven years, so when we see a big uptick, it&apos;s worth finding out why and what those people are looking for. So we did a survey...  The results are pretty interesting. Three things in particular...   Click over to read on. RIM discontinues 16GB PlayBook, still &apos;committed to the tablet space&apos; &gt;&gt; The Verge Continuing with the 32GB and 64GB models:   Despite this, RIM says it&apos;s still &quot;committed to the tablet space&quot; but believes the higher-capacity models offer &quot;more value for our customers.&quot; In many ways, it makes sense to bump up media tablet storage, and RIM&apos;s not the first company to cut out its lower-end devices. It&apos;s also rumored that RIM sees a significantly lower profit margin from the 16GB version, so this could be part of general cost-cutting measures as it moves into what it hopes will be a more profitable era.   Hang on - &quot;significantly lower profit margin&quot; implies RIM actually makes a profit on PlayBooks. That&apos;s not what its accounts have indicated over the past year. Very much the opposite.

    "text": "More people are living in cities than ever before. Urban growth is transforming the face of our planet. But with this growth comes tensions over space and resources. In this month&apos;s Global development podcast, John Vidal hears from developers, slum-dwellers and the UN&apos;s settlement&apos;s agency, UN-Habitat, about the challenges of urbanisation, and how they can be addressed. What measures can be adopted to ensure cities are able to cope with changing populations and the effects of climate change? Is there one golden solution to planning a city so that it works well? And how can we learn from the mistakes of the past to design the cities of the future, where we&apos;ll increasingly live? We focus on Nairobi, in Kenya, home to more than 3 million people and one of the fastest growing capital cities in Africa, to think through some of these questions.",

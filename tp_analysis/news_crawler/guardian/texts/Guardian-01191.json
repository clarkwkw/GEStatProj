    "text": "Aleks Krotoski and Charles Arthur tackle the week&apos;s biggest technology headlines in this edition of Tech Weekly, picking apart the rumours of the Facebook IPO, the fallout from the European ACTA MEP resignations, and the challenges Twitter faces after posting a new policy on tweet censorship. Just how ready is Facebook to float on the US public stock market, and what implications will this have for the site&apos;s longevity? How will Kader Arif&apos;s resignation from his position as rapporteur for the Anti-Copyright Trade Agreement affect the next stage in the ratification process? And how is Twitter&apos;s so-called censorship policy any different form other services  like Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Amazon  that have come before? Aleks is also joined by two experts in connected television: Richard Lindsay Davies of the Digital Television Group, a British organisation responsible for establishing the standards of the next generation of our broadcast entertainment systems. Gareth Klose is a former YouView developer and digital technologist who works on apps for our TVs. What&apos;s the difference between the TV in the corner and the computer screen, now that the former is increasingly incorporating the interactive features of the latter? And what will this mean for how we consume content in the future? Finally, we offer a heartfelt salute to Scott Cawley, Tech Weekly&apos;s producer of five years, who&apos;s going to pastures new. We hear tributes from Bobbie Johnson and Jemima Kiss.",

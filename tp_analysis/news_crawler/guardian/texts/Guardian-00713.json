    "text": "The suggestion that the previous government failed to address questions surrounding air quality (Report, 20 October) does not reflect the progress that has been made on the issue since December 2015. Since then, the governments air quality plan, updated modelling undertaken by Heathrow and an independent study by Cambridge University have all shown that baseline air-quality levels around the airport will have significantly improved by the time a new runway is built, as the nations vehicle fleet gradually becomes cleaner. The Airports Commissions analysis concluded that a third runway at Heathrow can be delivered in accordance with EU air-quality limit law, and would have less impact on health receptors (where people live and work) than a runway at Gatwick would have on the community in that area. A new runway at the UKs hub airport represents an opportunity to deliver significant improvements to air quality around Heathrow: the redesign of local roads, support for sustainable transport and the opportunity to introduce an airport emissions charge all have the potential to bring improvements in air quality. Since the Airports Commissions unanimous recommendation to the prime minister that Heathrow should expand, we have put in place a triple-lock guarantee on air quality. This includes a commitment to meeting our existing targets to improve air quality, ensuring that action can be taken if required to reduce road traffic and a commitment that extra capacity at an expanded Heathrow will only be released when it is clear that the airports contribution will not delay compliance with EU air quality limits. Expanding Heathrow will deliver up to 211bn in economic benefits for the whole of the UK, creating up to 180,000 new jobs and 10,000 apprenticeships. It has the support of unions, business, local residents and politicians, with 71% of Conservative MPs and 73% of Labour MPs backing a third runway in a recent poll of parliamentarians. The governments decision on airport capacity follows a rigorous, independent, 20m, two-and-a-half-year deep-dive into the issue, including a public consultation. It confirmed that Heathrow would not delay compliance with EU air quality limits, would see fewer people affected by noise and is the best choice for expansion. Now its time to get on with it and make a decision for all of Britain. Heathrow is ready to go.Nigel MiltonDirector of external affairs, Heathrow  Join the debate  email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",

    "text": "This week in Los Angeles, the future of the mainstream games industry will be announced. Over 200 developers will show up, spending many millions on huge stands and massive banks of monitors and demo machines. They will show their latest titles to more than 40,000 attendees and the whole thing will be broadcast, tweeted, reported and recorded by more than 4,000 journalists, all endlessly trudging the show floor. This is the most important event of the year as far as retail games are concerned. If you&apos;ve never been, here&apos;s a quick rundown of what happens and what you should look out for... The press conferences The Monday before the E3 exhibition officially opens, the biggest companies in the industry all run their own big press conferences, usually in the ornate old theatres littered around downtown LA. Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft and Sony will use their respective conferences to reveal what they&apos;ll be demo-ing when the actual show begins. This are all streamed live over the internet and most of the big game sites, the likes of GameSpot, IGN, Joystiq and CVG, will be hosting the streams. Also, I have organised a livestreaming event in the UK, EToo London. We&apos;ll be running all the conferences, with debate and analysis, via the EToo London YouTube channel. Here are the times of the conferences: Microsoft  9am Eastern (5pm UK)EA  1pm Pacific (9pm UK)Ubisoft  3pm Pacific (11pm UK)Sony  6pm Pacific (2am, June 11, UK) The E3 event E3 itself kicks off at the LA convention centre on Tuesday morning and continues through until Thursday. The event takes up two huge halls of the complex, as well as a number of other smaller locales around the site. Last year over 45,000 people attended, most of them video game publishers developers, retailers and journalists. It is a trade-only event, so there&apos;s no public access, though these days, the lines are blurred  lots of bloggers and YouTube video-makers will apply for press passes, and many will be accepted. Hence, the show&apos;s unique atmosphere  part-business event, part-showcase, part-community get-together. How to stay up to date We&apos;ll be covering the key events here on Games blog, but all of the specialist game sites will be absolutely bloated with E3 coverage over the next few days. If you want a UK perspective, go for CVG, VG247, Eurogamer or VideoGamer. Also check out the official websites of all the key publishers and developers, who&apos;ll often publish new trailers and footage as soon as it&apos;s announced. There&apos;s also an official E3 Expo site that will be jammed with footage. The key players you want to be following are: Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Activision, Bethesda, Warner, Capcom, Konami, Sega, Square Enix and Namco.  What should we be looking out for? The four big questions from the press conferences Here&apos;s what the gaming press want to know from Monday: 1. What does the PlayStation 4 look like? The console was announced at an event back in February, but Sony didn&apos;t actually show the machine itself. Everyone wants to know how it will compare to the rather boxy Xbox One.     PlayStation 4: glimpses of the console itself have been elusive. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters    2. What is going on with &apos;always on&apos; internet connectivity. Lots of console owners are worried by the revelation that the Xbox One will need to be connected to the internet every 24 hours if you want to continue playing games. There are also likely to be restrictions on the selling of pre-owned titles. Microsoft and the major publishers are keen to find new ways of preventing piracy and ensuring they make money from every copy of a game that gets distributed. However, how this works is highly ambiguous at the moment. Also, Sony hasn&apos;t revealed whether it has similar plans for PlayStation. The head of worldwide studios, Shuhei Yoshida, has stated that PS4 won&apos;t require a constant internet connection, but details are sketchy.3. What will be the big new gaming announcements?There are lots of titles we know are going to be at E3 (see our gallery of anticipated titles), but there will also be plenty of announcements  especially at the Sony and Microsoft press events. Some of the titles people are hoping to see confirmed are LittleBigPlanet 3, Fable IV, Dead Rising 3 and Mirror&apos;s Edge 2. We&apos;re also expecting to get glimpses of Bayonetta 2, Saint&apos;s Row 4 and the second season of the excellent Walking Dead adventure series from Telltale Games. The likes of Dead Souls II and the Wii U versions of Mario Kart and Super Mario will also be popular. 4. That&apos;s a lot of sequels, how about original titles?     Knack: Sony will show off the PS4 platformer at E3    Good question  and always one that journalists dwell on during the E3 week. Sony has open-world racer DriveClub and platformer Knack, both for PS4. Microsoft is promising 15 totally new &quot;franchises&quot; and we&apos;re expecting one of those to be Crytek&apos;s Roman hack-&apos;em-up, Ryse. EA should have Titanfall from Respawn Entertainment, the studio set up by the original creators of Call of Duty. And Activision is has space opera Destiny, from Halo originator, Bungie Studios. Elsewhere, look out for Bethesda&apos;s survival horror opus The Evil Within (from the original creator of Resident Evil) and Square Enix&apos;s intriguing thriller, Murdered: Soul Suspect. Industry insiders on the E3 experience We asked a number of developers and journalists about their E3 thoughts and memories. Here&apos;s what they has to say... How would you describe the experience of E3 to someone who has never been? Tom Bramwell, editor, Eurogamer: For most people who attend E3, it is a frenzy of appointments to hear product pitches and discussions conducted in dark, imposing exhibition halls full of ludicrously expensive fibreglass dioramas that have been designed to reflect product features - usually science fiction, military or fantasy settings - while providing space to house demo units. It&apos;s like a funfair where you&apos;re also supposed to do business. It&apos;s very silly. The weird thing is that I love it, probably because it creates so much work and allows for so much interesting analysis of how games are made and sold, although these days I prefer to enjoy it from afar. Ste Curran, game developer and writer:  Imagine fighting through a cardboard city constructed from adverts; through a slow-shifting swamp of unlikable men, saran-wrapped in logo-stained T-shirts, shambling like the dullest zombies. Imagine 100 desperately-competitive bloggers holding their iPhones above their heads to capture a Picadilly-Circus screen showing a digital countdown to the same Call of Duty trailer that has been playing on loop for six hours. Imagine a migraine. Jon Hicks, editor, Official Xbox Magazine: It&apos;s like three days in a violence-obsessed Disneyland, only crammed into a couple of warehouses with no natural light, and you know that nearly all the rides are going be really similar to ones you&apos;ve already tried and got bored of but you have to go on them anyway. The small children have been replaced by shuffling 20-something men grimly determined to harvest as much terrible merchandise as they can carry, and the wandering Disney characters have been replaced by scantily-clad women who they take cameraphone pics of. There is a constant, deafening soundtrack of rival booths trying to have the biggest explosions, interspersed with looping sales pitches that by the third day you can quote verbatim. You are usually late, and hungry, and reaching an appointment in a blank, white, air-conditioned meeting room away from the main hall feels like finding an oasis in the desert.      Destiny: eagerly awaited space opera for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One    Rich Stanton, veteran freelance writer: E3 is a show in the truest sense  the bottom line is money, but what really matters is the performance. It&apos;s well known how closely the big platform holders and publishers brief their retail partners before and around E3, but then the job is to convince the people in attendance and the millions watching that your console, your particular game, is the best. It&apos;s a competition for attention, and so brings out the very best and worst of the industry  from amazing surprises to booth babes. There are other events comparable to E3, but none offers quite this level of exposure  for one week, LA is the biggest stage in video games, and everyone&apos;s watching. For the biggest companies in gaming that makes it, for once, as much about the performance as the business. What do you think are going to be the big themes this year? Simon Barratt, develoepr and founder of FourDoorLemon: The PS4 vs Xbox One battle is going to be the ongoing theme for the whole week and I expect a new battleground will emerge with every new announcement from third parties throughout the show. I&apos;m excited to see how much VR sneaks in, certainly it has been getting great coverage and with the new Omnidirectional treadmill Kickstarter doing well and new devices coming from Razer, there is certainly a wave of exciting stuff for &apos;early&apos; (early for the new dawn of VR at least) adopters. I hope to see indie games become more of a focus for the show, although IndieCade and larger indies have attended for a long time there has been something of a spotlight put on the indie community by the new platforms and their support for them. Neil Long, editor of Edge Online: It&apos;ll be a good old-fashioned format war  Xbox One versus PlayStation 4. Microsoft and Sony know this is the most important E3 for years  they each have a new console to sell at the end of the year and the hardcore games player has a straight choice between the two. In terms of game announcements, they have to dazzle; big name games are vital, but a few fan favourites and some credible indie projects will show that they each understand where the future of their business lies  they need to empower and harness this new generation of independent game developers. Meanwhile, I honestly think Nintendo has done the smartest thing for them by stepping out of the race entirely. With its simple, cost-effective Nintendo Direct videos it is ditching all the silly bombast and taking its news straight to its audience. I think Nintendo could really surprise us: its Wii U hardware is confusing, but its games have never been in question  we&apos;re guaranteed a new Super Mario, Mario Kart, Smash Bros and more Zelda. Nintendo always throws in a few fan-pleasing favourites, too. A huge Wii U price cut is essential, though.     'A huge Wii U price cut is essential.' Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters    Nicholas Lovell, industry analyst and author: Microsoft will do a bunch of pointless stuff about you can watch sports on your console. The F2P guys will be less visible (E3 isn&apos;t for them) but Microsoft and Sony will both showcase F2P games on their new consoles. Publishers will unveil a bunch of new IPs, because the best time to launch a new IP is at the start of the console cycle. It will set the stage for the launch of PS4/Xbox One, but everyone will be disappointed: there won&apos;t be enough new IP. There won&apos;t be enough information on console launch plans. There won&apos;t be enough F2P or there will be too much. There will be too much about TV and sports and films. Andy Payne, CEO of Mastertronic and AppyNation: It&apos;s going to be all about the new set-top boxes  sorry, consoles  that Microsoft and Sony want to launch. And the games that will look ace. But eyes must also be peeled for more Oculus Rift action and ears open to see what Apple reveal at WWDC up the road in the eminently more cooler San Francisco. Whatever happens it will all be mad and bad in equal measure. Oh yes and there will be some very cool action in London at EToo. Don&apos;t miss it! What is your most memorable E3 experience? Ellie Gibson, associate features editor, Eurogamer: I always love the press conferences. Nothing beats that heady combination of exciting announcements, laughable hyperbole and graphs. And the highlight of every press conference is the bit where the executives try to do some comic banter.  The best ever example of this can be seen in the video of Sony&apos;s 2007 conference (skip to 13 min 45), where a virtual version of Jack Tretton shows us his &quot;new tricked-out apartment&quot; in PlayStation Home. &quot;I&apos;ve left the door open, so hopefully a few of those hot chicks from the square will pop in and join us,&quot; he says, before pretending to be surprised to find a virtual Kaz Hirai on his balcony.  &quot;Hey Kaz, what are you doing here??!?!?!&quot;  &quot;HA HA HA HA HA,&quot; says Kaz. &quot;I got some burgers and some hot dogs on the grill, what can I do you for?&quot;  There follows a bizarre exchange about turkey burgers and PSP before Tretton announces he is going to &quot;chill here on the deck&quot;.  At Eurogamer, we enjoyed this so much we even created a special trophy for our annual E3 awards  the &quot;Let&apos;s Chill Here on the Deck Memorial Award for excellence in strained banter.&quot; Jon Hicks: 2010 was just weird all week. Microsoft&apos;s Cirque du Soleil event unveiling Kinect was a long, baffling fever dream that felt like a religious sect gathering for the birth of a new and highly confusing deity. Activision&apos;s peak Guitar Hero moment was a live event featuring an unending string of massive music acts that went on so long I actually went to another event for an hour and came back. And then a variety of work-related crises required me and a publishing rep to work 20-hour days trying to coordinate across different time zones, which ended with me having a little breakdown in a Hollywood diner from a combination of stress, malnutrition and sleep deprivation. We&apos;ve tried to look back on it and laugh, but the scars run a bit too deep for that.

Photograph: Casey Rodgers/AP Images for XBox    Martin Hollis, developer: The indiscreet charm of a video game arcade as large as two fields must be acknowledged! but the ambience destroys most games and bleeds out the soul of many others. E3 is a meat-market for bangs. The same broad strokes apply to any industry-led exhibition including, sadly, Tokyo Game Show. Fewer games, fewer genres, less interesting work and marginal opportunity to discover fun new ideas. Rezzed, EToo, IndieCade, GameCity are all enormously more exciting to me than E3. An illustrative example: E3 2011 was notable to me as a show which included a game built around a kissing controller by Hye Yeon Nam and Deep Sea, a sensory deprivation and negative experience game by Robin Arnott, both in the IndieCade E3 booth. If I went again it would be for IndieCade.",

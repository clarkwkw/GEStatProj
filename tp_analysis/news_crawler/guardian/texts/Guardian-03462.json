    "headline": "Webchat: Quiz John Gummer on whether fairness or money should be the driver for environmental action", 
    "text": "From Monday at 11.30am former environment secretary John Gummer, Lord Deben; Huw Irranca-Davies MP; WWF&apos;s Tom Crompton and the Fabian Society&apos;s Ed Wallis will discuss your questions on the motivations for environmental and ethical living choices. As resources from clean water and air to fertile land become more scarce and expensive, sustainable consumption is becoming inevitable. But is the right approach being used to persuade people to change the way they live? A new study by the Fabian Society and our four panellists suggests that by targeting the public as consumers the government ignores the potential to change people&apos;s behaviour through appealing to concepts of fairness and justice. The study found that people are more prepared to make sustainable choices in co-operation with others. Is it economics or ethics that define your choices? Do you think more people would be willing to change the way they live if they thought it was fair? Post your questions below for our panel  please note anything off-topic will be removed.  Please note that this webchat has now finished so the panel will no longer be taking questions, but do feel free to continue commenting.",

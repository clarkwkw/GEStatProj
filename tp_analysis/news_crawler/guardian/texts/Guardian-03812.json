    "text": "Abolish the Death Penalty It is dark, silent and cold, the judge towers over me like a storm cloud, impassively he stares at me. I&apos;m escorted to a small courtyard, it reeks of death. I pray as the firing squad now take aim, a guard asks if I would prefer to be blindfolded. I cry out &quot;I am innocent&quot;  another victim is killed. The death penalty is one of the worst punishments that humans have created to attempt to control criminals. Killing villains to strike fear in others does not deter people being drawn into crime. China is possibly the worst country to wield the death penalty against its people. In one year it is estimated that more than a thousand deaths are carried out in China alone, while in 18 other countries 714 deaths were carried out. In 1995, a horrific 41 countries used the death penalty, some do not execute many people but others act as if on a killing spree. Electrocution or lethal injection may appear quick and painless, but can be slow and agonising for the victim. The death penalty is more costly, for example, in America it has been calculated to cost much more to keep a prisoner on death row than a full life sentence. The death penalty is a form of brutal revenge. It goes against our most important human right - the right to life. Mistakes can be made. Should an innocent person die, this sentence cannot be undone.",

    "text": "Last week, the World Bank appointed Jim Yong Kim as its new president. Kim was not a favourite for the post among Global development readers, trailing third behind first choice Jos Antonio Ocampo and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in our online poll. To mark his appointment, we asked a panel of experts to tell us what should be on Kim&apos;s to-do list during his first year in post. Among the contributors were Nancy Birdsall, president of the Centre for Global Development, who said Kim needed to find better ways of dealing with &quot;fragile states&quot;; Andrea Cornwall, a professor from the University of Sussex, who suggested a cull of the Bank&apos;s economists, who&apos;ve &quot;shown themselves to be part of the problem&quot;; Asif Saleh, from Brac, who advised the Bank to &quot;listen more and prescribe less&quot;; and economist Jayati Ghosh, from Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, who said the new president needed to &quot;make an honest and committed effort to change both the mindset and the functioning of this institution&quot;. Elsewhere on the site We reported on the OECD&apos;s review of the EU&apos;s aid programme. The review called on the EU to take a more cohesive approach to its development processes, and warned that European financial problems were putting at risk its collective target of spending 0.7% of GNI on aid. On the Poverty matters blog, Melanie Teff outlined how the Kenyan government could turn the Dadaab refugee complex into an asset by integrating its 500,000 Somalis into Kenya&apos;s economy as part of a development plan for the country&apos;s north-east. Fred Pearce argued why the Rio+20 Earth summit in June should put the land rights of peasant farmers on the agenda to stop so-called land grabs. Following greater regional co-operation, Stephen P Groff suggested that with improved governance and greater economic access, this could be the &quot;Asian century&quot;. Podcast On Friday we launched our latest Global development podcast, which this month questions whether the recent Kony 2012 campaign offers any feasible solutions to ending Lord&apos;s Resistance Army attacks in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Coming up on the site International land rights have become a hot topic of conversation recently. On Thursday we&apos;ll look at the latest data on &quot;land grabs&quot; from an international research project. Mark Tran will be reporting from Jamam refugee camp in South Sudan, where tens of thousands of people have fled to escape violence in Blue Nile state. Fred Kaufman will be blogging on the debate in the US around food speculation. Awards A Global development film has been nominated for this year&apos;s Webby awards.

What you said: some of the best comments from our readers Ahead of the recording of our podcast, Ugandan journalist RosebellKagumire contributed to our Talk point debate on how to support child soldiers:  We might remove Kony, but if we don&apos;t uproot factors that made Kony&apos;s war possible we are only addressing one war as we wait for another.  On Aida Kiang&apos;s blog on tax avoidance, chrisjords wrote:  There&apos;s a real desire in many countries (among both governments and civil society) to raise more revenues domestically &amp; move away from a dependence on aid.  Meanwhile, On Jonathan Glennie&apos;s blog discussing the impact of the Paris principles on Latin America, frazergoodwin said:  Firstly, if we are to drop aid to such countries should there not be a strategy that assists a transition, and secondly, is it not the purpose of aid to assist the poorest out of poverty no matter where they are?  Highlights from the blogosphere Following news last week that Africa is sitting on vast groundwater reserves, Roger Callow, from the Overseas Development Institute, looks at the issues behind the story, and what will it mean for poor people in Africa.

    "text": "Alongside Bioshock, Borderlands is the most interesting, multifaceted shooter of the last decade. It&apos;s not just the cunning mix of gameplay components  the incendiary FPS thrills of Halo, the joyous loot-grabbing of Diablo  it&apos;s the way in which it constructs a world that is at once fanciful and alien, but also hugely redolent of our own. As Christian Donlan put it so eloquently in his Borderlands 2 preview for Eurogamer, Borderlands wasn&apos;t just made in America, it is America, with its vast open spaces, its factionalism, its love of fine weaponry. Borderlands is funny but it means something.  And in the forthcoming sequel, where players once again become scavengers looking for treasures on the wasteland planet of Pandora, there is a renewed sense of anti-establishment satire. The antagonist is Handsome Jack, the CEO of the evil Hyperion Corporation, looking to clean out this dustball of all its weird clans and bandits. With your improvised weapons and lawless communities, you&apos;re the Old West, standing in the way of the railroad of capitalist progress.  But yeah, it&apos;s also funny, and Handsome Jack has been designed more for humour than to provide some sort of evil nemesis in the traditional gaming mould.  &quot;Ahhh, can&apos;t we just have fun?!&quot; groans Gearbox co-founder Brian Martel, exactly on cue.  We&apos;re sitting in a tiny meeting room in the business centre at Gamescom and the conversation has turned to the other shooters that were around at the time Borderlands was released; all those earnest military blasters with their cardboard cutout spec ops soldiers and dead-eyed patriotic fervour.  &quot;Games can be so serious, whether it&apos;s about soldiers in the Middle East or some megalomaniacal guy trying to take over Earth,&quot; he continues. &quot;We&apos;ve all played through those scenarios so many times! That&apos;s one of the fun things about Borderlands: the guys making the game are having as much fun as the players. And it&apos;s different every time  we haven&apos;t seen all the weapons in the game, it&apos;s impossible. It&apos;s almost like a hobby  it&apos;s what games should be&quot;.  Weapons are the engine of the Borderlands experience. As in the first title, players will be able to pick up modular guns constructed from a series of random parts, all with different specs. The thousands of possible firearms should end up suiting every individual playing style.  There are several fictional manufacturers in the game, each with its own identity, marketing and approach to design. While Vladof promotes its Kalashnikov-style high-fire-rate sub-machine guns with revolutionary zeal, Maliwan pushes its high-tech blasters as artworks in the gallery of war. Gearbox has even produced promotional videos for all the weaponry  you can find them all on 2K Games&apos; YouTube page, and they&apos;re worth a look, if only for the ridiculous care and detail that&apos;s gone in to them.  This is all both functional and an intrinsic element of the game&apos;s satirical approach. The guns are corporate culture exerting itself on the people, right? &quot;Yes, that&apos;s part of it,&quot; says Martel. &quot;I refer to our designer, Matt Armstrong, as the head of the weapons division at Gearbox. In the first game we didn&apos;t quite get the identity right with the manufacturers; this time we wanted to create a more compelling sense of brand affinity. You get people who love their Nikes and others who say, &apos;I love Adidas!&apos; - there&apos;s that rivalry. We see it with Apple and Android - I saw someone the other day who had a sticker on their car of an Android eating an Apple.  &quot;Matt wanted to get that with these gun manufacturers. He wanted gamers to get to the point where they&apos;d go and buy a T-shirt that said Maliwan on it. I think he&apos;s done a pretty good job of that. And then Kevin Duke, who was core in the conceptualisation this time round for the weapons, really took that to heart. He and the art director Jeremy Cook really worked to ensure that when you saw a weapon lying on the ground you&apos;d know the manufacturer, you&apos;d know it was a Jakobs&quot;.  Cleverly though, Gearbox is also messing with that whole idea of brand loyalty. &quot;Yes, Matt wanted to make it so that underlying in the design, you&apos;d sometimes need a gun that you didn&apos;t care about to beat certain creatures,&quot; says Martel. They&apos;re challenging you: brand vs gameplay  which will win out when it comes to the crunch? So the guns explore brand evangelism, but also the corporate machinery behind it. &quot;What was cool to me is that the team was really determined to make that a pervasive element,&quot; says Anthony Burch, who joined Gearbox as a writer in 2010 after Randy Pitchford became a fan of his hilarious web series, Hey Ash, Watcha Playing. &quot;It wasn&apos;t just like, we&apos;ll have a couple of funny commercials  no, all the guns are going to look and feel different and embody different gun fantasies, for want of a better phrase. As a consequence, you get that it&apos;s a dystopian game  even in the farthest outer wastelands you can&apos;t escape corporations, they&apos;re still the ones running the show and they don&apos;t necessarily have your best interest at heart.  &quot;There great some great moments when I was writing commercials for different gun manufacturers and we&apos;d have conversations like, &apos;okay, which of these corporations would sell me out and kill me if there was profit in it?&apos; And we came to the conclusion that they&apos;d all sell me out, it was just a question of who would do it quickest. None of them are good, you can&apos;t side with corporations. It&apos;s that idea of keeping everything dark and harsh and a little bit on the edge.&quot; This sense of authenticity, of a functioning logical world, exists throughout the game  even to the point where the team has invented technologies to explain genre conventions  like the enormous inventories characters carry around and re-spawning when players die.  &quot;We wanted to turn the mechanics and paradigms within the genre into things that felt correct for science fiction,&quot; says Martel. &quot;And one thing that&apos;s under-appreciated about Borderlands is the bits of sci-fi we&apos;ve done. For example, our concept of digistructing [a technology that allows items to materialise from digital blueprints] - that came out of the fact that the characters can&apos;t possibly hold all the guns they&apos;re carrying; I mean, where do they go? So we had this idea of an infinite storage deck represented by the holsters - when the character reaches for it, the gun creates in their hands. And that ties into the New You stations, which recreate you at the spot where you die. We were also consistent with the creature design: we asked, what is the commonality between them? So they all have this sideways mouth thing. It all feeds into the game&quot;.      For Burch, what&apos;s important is that the humour  like the corporate messaging  is a pervasive part of the experience. It&apos;s not just the odd daft piece of throwaway dialogue, or a funny new enemy. It&apos;s in everything. &quot;What&apos;s cool about how we&apos;ve designed the gags in the game is that they inhabit more than just one part,&quot; says Burch. &quot;There are a lot of funny lines, but there are also quests that are about comedy, delivered through gameplay or structure. We&apos;ll take what you expect will be a two-hour quest with lots of interesting gameplay, and make it a five-minute quest with no interesting gameplay just to screw with your expectations.  &quot;And the ideas can come from anywhere. We have a designer who said to me, &apos;I really like Top Gun, can we have a quest that&apos;s just about Top Gun?&apos;, I was like, &apos;What?! Yes! Why would I ever say no to that!?&apos;&quot; So there&apos;s a homoerotic topless volleyball sequence in Borderlands 2? &quot;Yes,&quot; replies Burch. &quot;Yes, we have that. I&apos;d like to say we&apos;re the first non-Dead or Alive game to have a topless volleyball scene&quot;. A noble aim. After two years at Gearbox, Burch says that he&apos;s learned a lot about humour in games. &quot;Yeah, in a weird way I appreciate how difficult it is, but at the same time  and this is going to sound stupid  I think it&apos;s easier than a lot of people make it out to be. You can count the number of funny games on one hand, but what&apos;s really interesting about that is, in most games, the gameplay itself does tend to be funny; it doesn&apos;t take itself seriously. Sure you have games like Shadows of the Colossus and Bioshock that are about big moral choices, and the mechanics reflect that, but for a vast majority of the time, you have games that are just, &apos;blow up all these heads and get experience points!&apos;, which is inherently not serious, it is funny.  &quot;I felt very blessed to work on a game like Borderlands that embraces all that  that understands it&apos;s all about shooting psycho dwarves in the face with guns that fire lightning. It understands that this is the charm of the game and doesn&apos;t shy away from having its tone and narrative reflect that&quot;.  Key to the successful implementation of humour into Borderlands is the team approach; the fact that every element of the game serves a common purpose. &quot;Any schmo can write a joke, but 90% of the joke is in the delivery; that goes double for games,&quot; says Burch. &quot;What I found really amazing is that, if any of my jokes work at all, it&apos;s because the designers are so damn good at what they do  they&apos;ll find the exact spot where the combat has just ended and there&apos;s a lull, and they&apos;ll make sure the punchline happens when it doesn&apos;t screw anything else up or occlude any of the other dialogue. Or if we&apos;re going to play around with the mechanics like having a gun that fires something funny, it has to have some gameplay value. It&apos;s a game above everything else, you have to find ways to implement humour without compromising the fun of the game.&quot; But timing is almost impossible in games, isn&apos;t it? You never know what a player is going to do next. &quot;That&apos;s totally true,&quot; says Burch. &quot; And we knew that if you&apos;re going along a path through this map in a reasonable way trying to follow objectives then we can put a comic moment in there but there&apos;s truly nothing stopping you from going, &apos;ah fuck it, I&apos;m leaving&apos;, and while we had a set up for a joke right here and assumed that five seconds later the pay off would play, you could just say, &apos;nope&apos; and go, and you come back an hour later and you&apos;ve forgotten the set-up. We&apos;re like, alright, that happens, it&apos;s a bummer  but we&apos;ll just throw a whole bunch more jokes at you&quot;.      At the same time, there is that underlying darkness. Pandora is a nightmarish hellhole, where everything in the environment  the plants, the animals, the locals, they all want to kill you; its mutated clans and bandit groups are the stuff of rural horror  the unknowable psychopaths of The Hills Have Eyes and Deliverance.  &quot;When I came on to the team, I knew the games, but I wasn&apos;t one of the people who helped build the world or understood the tone,&quot; says Burch. &quot;So one of the things that Jeremy Cook, the art director, made sure I knew, even as we expanded the Borderlands universe, was that any goofy wacky moments should still be anchored in something more serious, or more meaningful. For example, Tiny Tina, this wacky crazy character, has a really sad backstory. There&apos;s a bunch of stuff about Handsome Jack that&apos;s really goofy and OTT, but he does some very dark stuff.  &quot;Thematically, a lot of the things we play with are like the song from the first game, No Rest for the Wicked  well, the player is the wicked one, it&apos;s not something you&apos;re used to being called  usually you&apos;re the hero of light who saves us all!  Handsome Jack refers to himself as the hero and you as the bad guy and we play around with that a lot  but in a tongue in cheek way. We don&apos;t actually want you to be thinking, &apos;oh God, it&apos;s so awful I killed all those midgets&apos; No, it&apos;s fine they were throwing grenades at you. One of the things we made sure to do at the beginning of the game was, you&apos;re going along with Claptrap, fighting a bunch of bandits and when you kill them all your character says, &apos;What have we done?! These were people with lives, with families! ... Nah, I&apos;m just fucking with you, screw those guys!&apos; It puts you into the right frame of mind: this a game where those things don&apos;t matter, where you don&apos;t feel guilty. Even if it doesn&apos;t resonate as a theme or a philosophical point in itself, it&apos;s useful as a counterpoint. You need the straight man in a comedy routine  it gives you a license to be goofy&quot;.  Which brings us back to Handsome Jack, the lynchpin in the Borderlands 2 story. The key to him is, he isn&apos;t a standard video megalomaniac  he&apos;s a child. A gamer. &quot;Initially he was a rival vault hunter,&quot; says Burch. &quot;It was you and him basically racing to the treasure  like Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Ark. We knew from the very beginning we wanted a strong villain, we&apos;re super into Portal, Bioshock, System Shock  all those games have really strong antagonists that propel you through the narrative.  &quot;But he went through a bunch of iterations. Next he was going to be the owner of an evil gladiatorial arena, and then eventually we decided on the head of Hyperion. I&apos;m really curious to see how people react, he&apos;s a very unusual villain, he&apos;s a very immature guy. I wrote him as a 16-year-old GTA freak who has got to 99% completion and is almost at 100% and the fact he can&apos;t find that last item is pissing him off! He&apos;s a kooky guy.&quot;  And later, I&apos;m talking to Brian Martel about the humour, the way the team seems to enjoy pushing it, and the way the game&apos;s audience laps it all up. It is an interesting community. And Borderlands is all that&apos;s great, all that&apos;s creative and cathartic about games and game design. Did they plan for that? Did they know we&apos;d get it?  &quot;In many ways, Borderlands is an indie game that got lucky,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;It&apos;s like that indie band that you love and you&apos;re both pleased that they&apos;re successful, but also thinking, hey, that&apos;s mine. We can&apos;t believe people love this as much as we do  but, in the end, maybe that passion comes through&quot; Borderlands 2 is released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 21 September",

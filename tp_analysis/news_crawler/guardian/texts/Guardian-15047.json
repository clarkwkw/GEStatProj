    "text": "This Wednesday from 1-2pm, we&apos;re joined by the &quot;voice of cycling&quot;, Phil Liggett.  The world authority on cycling, who has commentated on 40 Tours de France, was offered a professional cycling contract in 1967 but turned it down as he saw a future in sports journalism. In 2005, he was appointed an MBE for his services to the sport. Phil is supporting the BHF London to Brighton Night Ride, which takes place on Saturday 13 July. The ride follows on from the huge day ride event which annually attracts 28,000 and raises money for the charity&apos;s Mending Broken Hearts Appeal.  Phil will be available to talk about all things cycling, from the event itself and the rest of the BHF&apos;s programme to the rising popularity of the sport in the UK, and the Tour de France, for which he is best known. Post your questions on the subject for Phil below he&apos;ll be online between 1-2pm on Wednesday 8 May to answer as many as possible.",

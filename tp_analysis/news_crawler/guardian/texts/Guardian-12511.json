    "text": "In a world of Wikipedia and internet-based essay-writing companies, it&apos;s never been easier for students to plagiarise their work. But as German education minister, Annette Schavan, found out today, it&apos;s also never been easier to get caught. While there are no hard stats on the number of students cheating at university, a recent survey of 80 institutions suggests such behaviour may be on the rise  in 2009-10 more than 17,000 incidents of cheating were recorded, up 50% in four years. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator, which deals with student complaints, says universities should do more to warn students about cheating. It says many students do not understand the rules surrounding plagiarism, while others feel the penalties imposed are too harsh. Most institutions now use online software, such as Tunitin, which extract text from students&apos; work and check it against other sources. But a study by a researcher at California State University suggests this isn&apos;t an instant fix. It found that those who are aware that their work will be checked by plagiarism-detection software are just as likely to cheat as those who are not. How much guidance did your university or school offer about plagiarism? Were you warned about the consequences? How easy is it to accidentally plagiarise? Are tougher penalties the answer?

    "text": "Twitter users have been hit by a blackout on the social networking site just a day before an expected surge in traffic for the Olympics Games opening ceremony. The twitter.com website was down for about two hours on Thursday because of a technical fault, although service was still partially accessible through its mobile site and some third-party applications. In a message to users, the company said: &quot;Howdy folks, looks like we&apos;re experiencing a small interruption of Twitter.com and some mobile clients.&quot; On its network status page, it wrote: &quot;Users may be experiencing issues accessing Twitter. Our engineers are currently working to resolve the issue.&quot; A spokeswoman for the company said she could not offer any reason as to why the site had crashed and it is not yet known what caused the fault, which was resolved by around 6pm. Twitter is expected to be one of the main social networking sites used by sports fans and athletes during the Olympics. Sporting events regularly attract an increase in activity on the site, and during the Euro 2012 final this month, users posted more than 15,000 tweets a second. There are more than 2,000 verified Olympians, past and present, signed up to use the service, but athletes have been warned about their Twitter use during the Games. London 2012 chairman Seb Coe said last week: &quot;I have found quite a close correlation between the number of tweets at competitive times and the level of under-performance.&quot;",

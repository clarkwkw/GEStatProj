In 2010, the site launched the Green Style Blog guest-edited by Eco Age creative director Livia Firth, supermodel Laura Bailey and Sheherazade Goldsmith, and followed Firth as she took on the Green Carpet Challenge  a blog documenting her attempts to dress ethically and sustainably throughout the awards season alongside her Oscar-nominated husband Colin. She once again takes up the challenge this year.",

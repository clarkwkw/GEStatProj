    "text": "Grid 2 goes back to basics with its approach to racing, which means no plot, no customisation and a soundtrack that only kicks in on the last lap of championship races, leaving tormented tyre rubber the sole accompaniment. Its races demand drifting: screeching semi-controlled power-slides around corners, with crash damage that affects your car&apos;s performance adding to the feeling of danger. From the mist that clings to forest roads, to the way exhaust pipes judder in their fittings, it&apos;s a beautiful game to look at, and one that delivers an absorbing sense of speed and competitive glory.",

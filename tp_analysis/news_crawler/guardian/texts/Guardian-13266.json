    "text": "As well as not being Nick Clegg&apos;s local school  it is just over two miles away  the London Oratory school is far from being an average comprehensive. Houses on nearby Halford Road in SW6 are on sale for 2.25m and almost 91% of pupils achieve at least five A* to C grades at GCSE, including English and maths. Across England, 51.9% of teenagers achieved this benchmark last year. Its results place the school in the top fifth of secondaries across the country. Just 6% of pupils come from deprived homes  a third of the average in England. However, the school takes an average number of pupils with special needs. On Monday, Clegg and his wife, Miriam Gonzlez, announced that they will be sending their eldest son, Antonio, to the school. The London Oratory delivers a strict Catholic education, stating that &quot;at all times it serves as a witness to the Catholic faith&quot;. Clegg is himself an atheist, but his wife is a Catholic. Until 2006, the school was allowed to select pupils in part by interviewing them and their parents. This meant that if a parent was involved in flower arranging or choir rehearsals at church, they stood a better chance of securing their child a place. But seven years ago, the schools adjudicator ruled that this could not continue. However, priority for the senior school&apos;s 160 places each year is always given to practising Catholics. Some will insist that Antonio will have been given a place because of his high-profile family, but it is more likely that his Catholic upbringing and church attendance will have secured it for him. Discipline is notoriously tough, according to one review on the Good Schools Guide site. While academic achievement is &quot;remarkable&quot;, the discipline is &quot;too strict for some&quot;, but &quot;clearly pays dividends&quot;, it says. Tony Blair sent his sons, Euan and Nicky, to the school. Other alumni include the actor Simon Callow, former Conservative MP Jerry Hayes and rugby union star Michael Swift. The school was a grammar in the 1960s, but became a comprehensive in the 1970s. It has not been immune from funding cuts. In 1999, the then headteacher, John McIntosh, asked parents to make up the school&apos;s deficit. He blamed the shortage on the Labour government. If Antonio wants to follow in his father&apos;s footsteps, he may well be given the help he needs  the school won an award in 2011 for the number of boys taking government and politics at AS-level, the first year of A-level.",

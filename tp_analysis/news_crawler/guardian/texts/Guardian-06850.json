    "text": "Regardless of where you go, there they are. In bushes, in parking lots, on sidewalks, underfoot. They&apos;re chirping, eating, hopping, quarrelling, fornicating. &quot;Little brown jobs,&quot; bird watchers murmur dismissively. Sparrows. They&apos;re seemingly everywhere.  In the opening sentence in her new book, Sparrow [Reaktion Books; 2012: Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US], environment writer Kim Todd immediately captures her readers&apos; attention by stating; &quot;The sparrow is a slight bird, small and dun-coloured, easily crushed.&quot; Easily crushed?    Despite this seeming fragility, Europe&apos;s house sparrow, Passer domesticus, is surprisingly tough, forming boisterous crowds that spilled out of the world&apos;s largest cities to colonise six continents. Their exuberant yet tuneless chirps can be heard nearly everywhere that people are found, from the Arctic Circle near the top of the world to the bottom of mine shafts. So omnipresent is this species that they are true human commensals, voluntarily forsaking their original wild home to depend upon our table scraps for food, our structures for housing and our presence for safety. This familiarity has aroused admiration and even a benign fondness, as celebrated in art, literature and poetry, as well as controversy and sometimes overt hostility, from the informal sparrow wars that took place in New England newspapers and pubs during the 1800s, to Mao Zedong&apos;s formally declared &quot;Sparrow War&quot; in the late 1950s, a campaign that triggered a famine that claimed more than 30 million Chinese lives.  For better or for worse, sparrows have always been with us, it seems. The many lavish colour illustrations that adorn nearly every page of this book -- paintings, drawings, photographs, newspaper clippings, diagrammes -- and the quotations from poetry and literature expose the profound impact that sparrows have had upon human cultures and upon the collective human consciousness. It has always been like this: even our early ancestors lived alongside these small birds, as revealed by charred sparrow bones retrieved from 3,000-year-old Swedish cooking pits. Although the book focuses on the house sparrow and its close relationship with people, this narrative also looks at the New World sparrows (family: Emberizidae), more commonly known as the American sparrows. Geographically limited to the New World and sharing the overused moniker &quot;sparrows&quot;, the emberizids are unrelated to the Old World Passeridae, which becomes obvious when any of these &quot;little brown jobs&quot; sings.  There is some science in this book, too. Several scientists&apos; work is described, particularly Martin Morton&apos;s and Luis Baptista&apos;s elegant investigations into the origin and function of regional song dialects sung by white-crowned sparrows, and the research into avian stress by a grad school labmate, Creagh Breuner, and her team. Also highlighted are investigations of different house sparrow populations located throughout the world that surprised us by showing how rapidly speciation can progress -- a dynamic process that has intrigued and inspired me throughout my lifetime. Sparrow research has provided us with many insights into human and avian evolution, physiology, behaviour and ecology, but many mysteries still await us. Perhaps most perplexing is the still-unsolved mystery of diminishing house sparrow populations. Already in the early 1900s, the messy, rambunctious flocks of house sparrows that plagued and pooped on our cities were decreasing. The smaller sparrow populations that resulted were attributed to decreasing numbers of horses -- and &quot;their lightly processed oats&quot; that sustained these birds. But in the 1970s, house sparrow populations suddenly plummeted -- so much so that the species has disappeared altogether from some of its former urban haunts around the world. Disturbingly, other Passer sparrows are also in decline. Research suggests this decline may be tied to the general lack of insects in cities, which the adults feed to their newly hatched nestlings. Other research indicates that sparrowhawks are moving in to large cities to rear their own hungry chicks on the many fat, fearless sparrows residing there. But no one really knows the reason for this latest population decline.  Even though this book is well-written and carefully researched, some inaccuracies inevitably do pop up. For example, a photograph of a golden-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia atricapilla, is mistakenly given the scientific name for its smaller sister species, the white-crowned sparrow, and a chipping sparrow, Spizella passerina (a clear-breasted species), is misidentified as a song sparrow (a species whose breast has bold stripes with a distinctive dark smudge over its heart).  Overall, this is an interesting little book. As Ms Todd unravels the story of house sparrows in this engaging narrative, we gain new insights into these cheeky little brown jobs -- and ourselves.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

    "text": "About 2,000 people with no legal papers have died trying to reach the US from Central America in the past 10 years. These deaths are usually due to exposure or dehydration  across the deserts of Arizona  but also drowning, for those who tried to cross rivers. More striking, however, are the tens of thousands who are kidnapped by criminal gangs and killed because they fail to pay a ransom. There are structural reasons for rising migration flows into the US. One is doubtless the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, which caused the bankruptcy of many small-scale Mexican farmers, forcing them to leave and look for jobs in the US. In Europe, it is estimated that at least 20,000 people have drowned since 1990 trying to leave Africa and the Middle East across the Mediterranean, often fleeing conflicts. In these cases, the war against immigrants does not seem to stop at borders. Even when Africans succeed in reaching Europe, they face discrimination, exploitation and abuse  including xenophobic propaganda and racist attacks. Some of the worst stories, however, come from Asia. At Kathmandu airport, in Nepal, an average of two coffins arrive every day, bringing back the corpses of migrants who went to work in the Middle East or the Gulf. The authorities say they die in accidents, particularly on building sites or on the roads. But many are murdered by traffickers and many others, especially women, commit suicide because of sexual abuse and harassment. All these cases show that national migration policies have failed. They show the complete inadequacy of what is still a unilateral, temporary and often repressive approach to mobility. It should be clear by now that economic migration is not exceptional, but, increasingly, part of normal life, linked in particular to the demand for labour in advanced economies and to globalisation. Not only do migrants contribute significantly to the GDP of their own countries through remittances, but they are indispensable to the economies and societies of wealthier countries. In the US, studies have shown that immigrants generate public wealth in excess of their cost in the long term to state and federal services. On the other hand, the international community has failed to ensure that migration is managed realistically and co-ordinated globally. The UN treaties that try to regulate labour migration, and ensure safety and dignity along the route, have been ratified and implemented by a relatively small number of states, and rarely by richer receiving countries. The only alternative to further exploitation and violation of human rights is genuine grassroots organising by migrants, along with local workers and citizens. A new generation of migrant workers is revealing its potential for collective action, as many change from being passive victims of exploitation to conscious, social agents. Over the past few years, migrants have been more and more determined to assert their social and labour rights. From the building sites of Dubai where south-east Asian workers fought for fair wages and better living conditions, to Mexican farm labourers who joined the protests in the fields of California against immigration reform under George W Bush; from the sans papiers (without documentation) African cooks in the restaurants of Paris that demanded and obtained full regularisation, to Moroccan metalworkers who downed tools in Italian factories and took to the streets to protest against rampant xenophobia and discrimination. Immigrants are increasingly participating in local trade unions, and they are more inclined to organise and make demands than locals. Through these struggles, migrants not only promote their rights and push for reforms, but help reinvigorate local social movements. The protagonists of today&apos;s diasporas are more and more engaged in online activism and can create virtual communities, groups and networks, reaffirming feelings of transnational solidarity. Network relationships created by migrants and encouraged by technological tools such as Facebook, Twitter and Skype are effective for producing a response by social and labour movements against the widespread erosion of rights, which keeps producing exploitation and social insecurity almost everywhere, and for everyone.",

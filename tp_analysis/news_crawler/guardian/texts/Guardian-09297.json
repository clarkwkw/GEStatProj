    "text": "The huge logistical challenge of delivering millions of new iPhone5s all over the world has led to a spike in the cost of air freight. Transport experts said the launches of Apple products have become such big business for the air cargo industry that delivery firms and airlines have chartered dozens of extra planes, cancelled scheduled routes and ditched staff training during &quot;Operation iPhone Drop&quot;. In the latest quarterly health check on the US economy, published on Thursday, the Federal Reserve said: &quot;Air cargo companies saw an increase in cargo volume tied to the launch of various smartphones and computer tablets, which favour shipment by air over other modalities.&quot; Martin Dixon of freight research firm Drewry said the delivery of the iPhone had helped the air freight industry bounce back from a collapse in prices  July were the lowest since July 2009, when most of the developed world was gripped by recession. Dixon said the indicative average cost of air freight from China to the west had risen 7% to $3.56 (2.20) per kg between August and September, and he expected it to rise even higher this month in the wake of the iPhone5 launch. He said Apple has had a &quot;huge impact&quot; on the air freight industry, which is experiencing a deep contraction as many companies cut spending by transporting more goods by sea. &quot;Only a few years ago smartphones weren&apos;t around, now they make up a huge part of air freight goods,&quot; he said. &quot;Apple is very clever at how it manages its supply chain, and its ability to secure air freight capacity to launch new models is a key part of that strategy.&quot; John Manners-Bell, chief executive of research firm Transport Intelligence, said Apple&apos;s demand for air cargo capacity was so large that it was &quot;able to skew rates across a large proportion of the global air cargo market&quot;. He said it was too early to say how much rates had risen as result of the iPhone5, launched on 21 September, but said prices spiked by 20% when Apple launched the latest iPad version in March. Manners-Bell said Apple was now &quot;by far the biggest air cargo shipper in the world by some margin&quot;, and the industry was awash with rumours about measures taken by logistics companies and airlines to meet the US company&apos;s demands. &quot;There is talk of airlines pulling scheduled routes to [have more planes free] to serve the Apple account,&quot; he said. Kevin Sterling, a freight transport analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets, said he had heard that Apple had chartered up to 70 jets in the runup to the launch of the iPhone. He predicted thatthe air freight rate could reach as high as $5 per kg in the days surrounding the launch. US delivery giant FedEx postponed training classes for staff during the first few days of the iPhone launch as it prepared for a &quot;surge event&quot;, according to an internal memo leaked to MacRumours. The analysts said none of the big delivery companies would divulge the impact of the iPhone, but Chinese delivery firm THI Group, which provides freight services for a company that assembles the iPhone 5, reported a 50% rise in profits from Hong Kong and China on Thursday. Apple sold 5m iPhone5s in the first three days after the product launched, but a withdrawal of scratched phones before delivery has led to sales forecasts for the iPhone5 in the last three months of this year being cut from 57m units to 49m.",

    "text": "    This week&apos;s element is bismuth, which is represented by the symbol Bi and the atomic number 83. Known since ancient times, bismuth is one of the first 10 metals discovered by humans, although it wasn&apos;t named until comparatively recently (1660 or so). Its name apparently comes from the Old German word for &quot;white&quot;.  Bismuth is fairly common in the wild. It occurs in a variety of minerals (often in the company of lead) as well as in its elemental state in the Earth&apos;s crust. As its name implies, pure bismuth does appear to be a white metal although closer inspection reveals it is a pale pinkish-grey colour. But when oxidized, its outer layer forms a spectacular iridescent tarnish that reflects a dramatic rainbow of colours. It is this colourful iridescent exterior makes bismuth one of my favourite elements.  Most people are familiar with this element because bismuth subsalicylate resides in many medicine chests in the form of Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate. Bismuth is also used in cosmetics, particularly lipsticks and fingernail polishes because it provides a lovely pearlescent finish. Due to its unusually low toxicity, bismuth is now being substituted for lead in a number of lead-based alloys. Probably the most widespread use for bismuth these days is as an environmentally-friendly replacement for lead in shot, bullets and gun ammunition. Many bird species suffer lead poisoning because they either ingest lead shot instead of small stones to aid digestion or, as in the case of California condors, because it is present in the carcasses they consume. Bismuth&apos;s density also makes it a non-toxic lead replacement in fishing sinkers.  In addition to its low toxicity and its beauty, bismuth has more quirky qualities that make it memorable. For example, like water (which is a compound), elemental bismuth is denser as a liquid than as a solid. In fact, bismuth is the least metal-like of all the metals. It is brittle. It has the highest electrical resistivity and one of the lowest thermal conductivities of all the metals. It can act as a semiconductor under certain circumstances.  As our favourite chemists tell us in today&apos;s video, bismuth was reputed to have the heaviest stable isotope known, bismuth-209. However, this isotope was recently discovered to be oh-so-very-slightly radioactive, having a half life of 19 billion billion (1.9 x 1019) years -- this is more than a billion times longer than the estimated age of the universe:             [video link] .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

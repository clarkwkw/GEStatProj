    "text": "The government is to bow to parent pressure and ease the burden of testing on primary school pupils in England, by dropping an election pledge to make children resit exams and offering a two-year freeze on new assessments. The announcements, made by the education secretary, Justine Greening in a statement to parliament, mark a break with the era of Michael Gove as education secretary, who ratcheted up the number and difficulty of assessments for primary school pupils, leading to boycotts by parents and threats of industrial action by teaching unions. Secondary leaders will welcome the governments plans to halt planned resits in year seven. These tests would not have helped children or teachers, said Kim Johnson, principal of Bradfields Academy in Kent and president of the National Association of Head Teachers.  Greenings announcement included a reassurance that the results from this years tougher assessments would not be used to judge schools, and unveiled a new public consultation over the scope of testing of primary school-age pupils. In a further move, Greening said a controversial Gove-era spelling, grammar and punctuation test for pupils aged seven  introduced for the first time last summer  would be voluntary and effectively dropped for at least the next year.

There has been significant change in recent years, but the timeline from this point will bring greater stability, with no new national tests or assessments introduced before the 2018-19 academic year. Headteachers expressed relief that Greening had decided to back away from a promise made in last years Conservative general election manifesto, which would have forced all pupils failing reading and maths assessments at the end of primary school to resit exams in year seven, their first year of secondary school. The policy was roundly opposed as disruptive for pupils in their first year of secondary school, and Department for Education (DfE) officials are understood to have advised ministers that the resits would be ineffective and unworkable. We told her that mathematics and reading resits were not necessary, and are pleased that she has listened, understood the issues and now stated that there will be no mandatory year seven resits, said Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. Anne Watson, emeritus professor of mathematics education at the University of Oxford, said she welcomed the removal of the threat of resits.  In mathematics, most of the material tested at key stage two also appears in key stage three already, and is integrated into more advanced ideas and approached in ways more appropriate to the age group, Watson said. Greening also promised a longer term, sustainable approach by launching a consultation on primary assessment and school accountability early next year. This will cover key issues, including the best starting point to measure the progress that children make in primary school, and the role and operation of teacher assessment, she said. Concerns over the state of primary school assessment have increased over the past two years, after key stage one and key stage two tests were made more challenging, and a baseline assessment was added for reception class children, added to the phonics check taking place at the end of year one.   Related: Fresh humiliation as Sats answers published online for second time    The baseline assessment was abandoned by the DfE over reliability issues, but earlier this year a small but vocal group of parents withdrew their children from school to protest against key stage one tests. The new tests had teething problems, with the spelling, punctuation and grammar test at key stage one halted after it emerged the exam paper had been published inadvertently online. Answers to the key stage two version were also released online in error before pupils sat the exam in May. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) has previously called for an overhaul of the primary assessment regime, with the threat of a boycott by teachers. The announcement by the new secretary of state is a response to professional concerns raised by teachers, headteachers and the NUT. These concerns are credible and valid, and motivated by a desire to end teaching to the test and the excessive pressure on children, said Kevin Courtney, the NUTs general secretary. While the changes outlined are moving the system in the right direction, they dont resolve the underlying effects of standardised testing and the effects of using unreliable numbers to rank schools and label children, he added.",

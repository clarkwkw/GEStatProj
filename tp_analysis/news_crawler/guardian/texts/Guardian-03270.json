    "text": "The end of the first week of teaching in the South African academic year is an experience that any academic at any university around the world would recognise: the chaos of finding timetables and new lecture venues; the inevitable problems with IT and parking spaces; the long queues at university bookshops; and in the midst of all this, a new group of anxious, happy, first-year students. They too are like first-year students anywhere. But in South African terms, they are deeply unusual. In January, Angie Motshekga, the minister for basic education, announced with some fanfare that 70.2% of the pupils who sat the examinations for the national senior certificate  usually referred to as matric  passed. In a country with high levels of deprivation and poor resource allocation, this appears to be a magnificent achievement. Unfortunately, the celebrations hid a few worrying facts. In 2011, according to the well-respected NGO, Equal Education, there was an 8% drop in the number of pupils taking the exam, and of the 923,463 pupils who began grade 1 in 2000, only 496,090 took matric in 2011, meaning that nearly half dropped out during their school career. When measured against all those who began school in 2000, the real matric pass rate falls to 38%. Moreover, of the 70.2% who did pass, only slightly less than a quarter of these achieved marks high enough to qualify for university entry. The tragedy is that even though such a small proportion of school leavers have the marks to enter university, there are not enough places to go around. Last month, a stampede at the University of Johannesburg killed the mother of a potential student, and injured several other people. Thousands of parents and prospective students had turned up to register  in all, around 85,000 students applied for only 11,000 places. The government has announced measures to further open up access to higher education. In his state of the nation address, president Jacob Zuma announced the building of two new universities, and minister for higher education and training, Blade Nzimande, has committed to expanding the whole further and higher education sector. I&apos;m lucky to work at a university which attracts the best students in South Africa, but, even so, many first-year students aren&apos;t properly prepared. Here and at other universities, academics have to make up for the poor preparation for tertiary education in schools. I feel strongly that a lot of students shouldn&apos;t be at university in the first place  that they should have gone on to further education and training (FET) colleges where they would have received an education more narrowly focused on preparing them for the job market. The crux of the issue is that despite the fact there are about 600,000 unemployed graduates in South Africa, university education is seen as the only pathway to employment. I would rather the department of higher education and training invested in FET colleges  expanding access to their campuses, improving the quality of their diplomas, and providing scholarships to those who can&apos;t afford tuition fees. As an academic, I am torn between wanting to help my students do well, and pursuing my own research. I can only earn research funds by publishing, and I can&apos;t publish with a heavy teaching load. I can&apos;t teach students how to study independently, use a library, do research, and write essays without sacrificing my own research time. This dilemma becomes even more fraught as universities are placed under even greater pressure by the higher education department to produce more graduates, to ensure as many students as possible complete their degrees. Getting students to pass requires more input from me, even though my research-oriented university rewards me for doing research. So do we continue failing students who don&apos;t make the grade? Or do we drop our standards and allow as many to pass as possible? Given that 7.5 million South Africans are unemployed, I don&apos;t think we should even be arguing about university entrance at the moment. We should be fixing our education system, and making affordable, good quality vocational training, which could conceivably lead to university education, more easily available.

    "text": "This week on Science Weekly with Alok Jha, we hear about the launch of a new open-access science journal, eLife. Editor-in-chief Randy Shekman introduces the new journal, which is free not only for readers but also for authors. He says eLife will put into practice the principle of free and open access for all to the fruits of scientific research  much of which is funded by public institutions. Alok is joined in the studio by Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample and by Observer science editor Robin McKie, to discuss this week&apos;s science news, including extra UK science funding announced in the chancellor&apos;s Autumn statement and the hotly anticipated news from the Mars rover Curiosity on organic compounds found on the red planet.  Finally we hear excerpts from Robin&apos;s interview with James Watson, co-discoverer with Francis Crick of the structure of DNA, and the editors of the new edition of The Double Helix  which is being published to mark the 50th anniversary of Watson&apos;s Nobel prize. What did Watson have to say about the other two key players in the discovery, Rosalind Franklin and his fellow prizewinner, Maurice Wilkins?

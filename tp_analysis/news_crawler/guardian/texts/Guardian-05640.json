    "text": "I support Michael Meacher&apos;s call for a public inquiry into the Consulting Association blacklisting conspiracy (Letters, 25 April). It was documents disclosed at my employment tribunal against the construction giant Carillion that brought to light the probable collusion by police and/or security services in the first place. I was granted a court order to view the entire unredacted database, and it was immediately apparent that information on some blacklisting files could only have been supplied by officers of the state. In my opinion, the most probable source for some of the surveillance intelligence appears to be undercover police officers who infiltrated leftwing and anti-racist groups (as previously exposed by the Guardian). Until a full public inquiry takes place, it will be impossible to get to the truth of how and why this information about union activists made its way on to an illegal blacklist run by private building firms.Dave SmithBlacklist Support Group  I don&apos;t think it is just the government we have to fear over data-sharing (Report, 24 April). A friend who got a supermarket credit card she has never used received a letter from the supermarket including the following paragraph: &quot;We have recently reviewed the information we hold for you and we&apos;ve noticed that you may be Politically Exposed [PE], or related to, or associated with, someone who is. A [PE] person is someone who is in a position of influence or power, for example [an MP].&quot; To our knowledge she is not PE, but we wonder why they think she is, and how they got their information.Ed RichardsonRingmer, East Sussex",

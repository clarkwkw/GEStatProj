    "text": "A cursory examination of Fire Emblem: Awakening reveals a title so steeped in the cliches of Japanese role-playing games that it seems it would be of interest to only a niche audience in the west. There are reams of text, digit-saturated menu screens and large portions of time devoted to storytelling; all integral to the core of a real Japanese RPG. But Fire Emblem: Awakening is also a brilliantly realised, fantasy-themed real-time strategy game, where turn-based combat is the focus of the action. That means presiding over small battlefields, moving units and engaging in one-to-one combat, dictating your squad&apos;s every decision. The gameplay is complex, but well-balanced and paced, and the narrative surprisingly captivating, making this a perfect entry point to the long-running series that may yet find a new audience here.",

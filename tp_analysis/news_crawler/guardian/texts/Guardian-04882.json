    "text": "Phillip Tobias, who has died aged 86, was born on the right continent, in the right country, at the right time. He would joke that, at the moment he was conceived, the anthropologist Raymond Dart was examining a skull and establishing that the cradle of humankind was not Asia, but Africa. Tobias grew up to collaborate with Dart and to become an internationally renowned palaeoanthropologist in his own right. For half a century Tobias led excavations at the Sterkfontein caves in South Africa, the world&apos;s oldest continuous paleontological dig, now a world heritage site known as the Cradle of Humankind. Sterkfontein has produced more than a third of the world&apos;s early hominid fossil finds, including Little Foot, an almost complete skull and skeleton which had opposable big toes. At 4.17m years old, this was the most ancient skeleton that had thus far been found. In 1995 Tobias, with Ronald J Clarke, presented Little Foot as &quot;probably the most momentous palaeoanthropological find ever made in Africa&quot;. Much earlier in his career, in 1959, Tobias had been involved in another momentous discovery. The archaeologists Louis and Mary Leakey sent him a damaged skull to examine, which they had discovered in Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. The story has it that in sympathy with evidence of damage inflicted 2m years earlier, Mary Leakey had exclaimed: &quot;Oh, the dear boy!&quot; The ancestral branches of humans and chimpanzees had diverged 3m years before Dear Boy, as the specimen came to be known, appeared and in 1964 Tobias finally confirmed that a new human species had been found. It was named Homo habilis, in reference to its capacity to use tools. Tobias was nominated three times for a Nobel prize and became a popular  indeed adored  professor who stood out even among South African academics as an extremely brave opponent of apartheid. He regarded it as a profoundly political fact that life began in Africa and believed it was the duty of science to expose the truths about race that ran counter to the tenets of apartheid, saying: &quot;The colour of someone&apos;s skin is genetically of no scientific importance whatsoever.&quot; Tobias was also among those who exposed the Piltdown Man hoax in 1953, helping to show that bone fragments found in Sussex that were supposed to represent a missing link between man and ape were a forgery, a mixture of human and orangutan remains. Tobias was born in Durban, South Africa. He was able to read by the age of three, but had to contend with his parents&apos; divorce as well as his father&apos;s bankruptcy. When he was 15, his sister Valerie, then 21, died of diabetes. &quot;It smote me bitterly,&quot; he later said, adding: &quot;My maternal grandmother had died of diabetes. But I never had diabetes, nor did my mother.&quot; Neither the family doctor, nor anyone else, could explain and Tobias resolved to be the first South African to understand such mysteries of genetics. In 1944, after attending Durban high school and, briefly, St Andrews in Bloemfontein, he enrolled at the medical school of the University of the Witwatersrand, receiving BSc degrees in histology and physiology in 1946-47, and gaining his medical degree in 1950. He was elected three times as president of the students&apos; union (1948-50) and led some of the earliest campaigns against the apartheid government. In 1953 he obtained a PhD with a thesis entitled Chromosomes, Sex-Cells and Evolution in the Gerbil. But he was to be diverted from his work with the living by a chance discovery he had made one day in 1945. With a botanist friend in the Transvaal, he was taking a closer look at a twisted, horizontal yellowwood tree in a cave when he felt a hard object beneath the soft sand. He pulled it out and recognised it as a stone tool, which proved to be of the Southern African middle stone age, 50-100,000 years old. A dig was launched, and around 3,000 tools were excavated, some of which suggested artistic activity, making the site one of considerable archaeological importance. Tobias undertook postgraduate research in 1955 at Cambridge University and, in 1956, in Chicago. In all, he garnered five degrees, including a DSc for his work on hominid evolution. In 1959 he succeeded Dart as professor and head of the department of anatomy and human biology at the University of the Witwatersrand, adding honorary professorships in palaeoanthropology and zoology. Skills and abilities impressed Tobias. He loved cricket; his alma mater, Durban High, had given the world Hugh Tayfield, Trevor Goddard and Barry Richards. He encouraged his students to expect the unexpected in experiments. He objected strongly to supporters of intelligent design employing the word &quot;science&quot; in defence of their beliefs. South Africans saw him as a kind of Indiana Jones figure. He was short, but always dapper and in his youth his moustache made him look rather like a 1940s film star. He loved tea, chocolate, teasing TV directors  &quot;I&apos;m glad I put my teeth in&quot;  having singsongs and braais (barbecues). One of his favourite tales involved Dart&apos;s wife leaving the fossilised Taung skull in a London taxi. After the end of apartheid, Tobias led negotiations to have the remains of Saartjie Baartman, a Khoi woman paraded through Europe in the 19th century as the Hottentot Venus, to be repatriated from Paris. Her grave is now a national heritage site. Tobias published more than 1,000 articles in academic journals and authored or co-authored 33 books including a memoir, Into the Past (2005). He received 17 honorary degrees from around the world and was a fellow or member of 28 learned societies, including the Royal Society, to which he was elected in 1996. He said: &quot;I&apos;m often asked why I didn&apos;t marry or have children. I&apos;ve had 10,000 children. Those medics, dentists, therapists, pharmacists, nurses who&apos;ve been through here  those are my children.&quot;  Phillip Vallentine Tobias, palaeoanthropologist, born 14 October 1925; died 7 June 2012 ",

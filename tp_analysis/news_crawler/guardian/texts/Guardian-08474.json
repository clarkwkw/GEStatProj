    "text": "The King&apos;s School, a private school in Tynemouth, North Tyneside, with fees of 9,990 a year, is set to merge with a nearby state primary, Priory school, to create a new academy. Parents will no longer pay fees. Seven other independent schools have already become state academies. Anthony Seldon, Master of Wellington College &quot;It&apos;s a good thing  particularly if the alternative is that the school closes altogether, and if it retains its very distinctive ethos and record of great success. The worry is if that all dissipates  if great staff want to leave, if it doesn&apos;t have the same aspirational ethos. I don&apos;t think we should get rid of fee-paying altogether, because diversity of provision is important and if people want to pay for health or education or a bigger house then we should let them. It wouldn&apos;t be acceptable for the state to forcibly close fee-paying schools and deny parents that option. That&apos;s not what opinion polls show the majority of the population wants and it would be profoundly undemocratic. So I don&apos;t think all independent schools should become academies. But I do think they should either become an academy or sponsor an academy.&quot; Steve White, divisional secretary, Waltham Forest NUT &quot;An academy school isn&apos;t a state school. If all private schools were turned into schools supported by their local authorities that wouldn&apos;t be a terrible thing, as long as it was accompanied by a lot of money. But I don&apos;t think this school in Tyneside becoming an academy is a good thing. They&apos;re getting the same private school on the cheap without the parents having to pay. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s something the state should pay for.&quot; Denise Grayson, who removed her daughter from Priory primary last week after the merger was announced &quot;It&apos;s not a good thing  especially if the state school is being used to prop up a school that&apos;s failing to recruit enough students. The ripple effect will be felt very heavily for years to come. It&apos;s going to be damaging to the local nursery and to the local high schools. It&apos;s not happening in a vacuum. There will be repercussions for the community.&quot; Richard Giles, vice chair of Tynemouth village association &quot;Comprehensive education can only work if it is truly comprehensive, and privilege and wealth have seriously eroded its effectiveness ever since 1945. Both King&apos;s and Priory schools are outstanding, contributing much to Tynemouth in every way, but the risks are great in meddling. In the short term, problems will arise when a school as good, and with such superb facilities, as King&apos;s enters the local arena and inevitably rocks the boat for a while. But who knows, when everything has settled down, and different governments have clipped wings and regularised things, we could conceivably end up with a more equitable system, with fewer independents and a more truly comprehensive education for all.&quot; Interviews by Harriet Swain",

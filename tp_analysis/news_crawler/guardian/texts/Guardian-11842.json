    "text": "Ostensibly a 2D pick-up-and-play scrolling platformer, Fractured Soul, in development since 2004, offers far more than might be expected. The only apparent objective is to escape a labyrinthine space station filled with baddies. Drawing comparisons with retro classics of the Mega Man ilk, the game blends familiar run, jump and shoot &apos;em up mechanics with the ability to switch between the 3DS&apos;s dual screens, where pressing the shoulder buttons offers a parallel view of gameplay. This works surprisingly well, with an alternative self invulnerable to solid structures and enemy fire, enabling you to outmanoeuvre bad guys and solve puzzles. It quickly ramps up to frantic, often excruciating, difficulty, demanding lightning fast reactions and co-ordination to track the action across two screens. New challenges are also frequently introduced, such as slippery ice or inverse gravity on the second screen. Fractured Soul has the potential to earn its stripes as a bona fide 3DS classic. Not to be missed.",

    "text": "Nathaniel McClure spent six years working on the very first Call of Duty titles before leaving Activision to set up his own small studio in Michigan. Scientifically Proven Entertainment has already produced several successful titles including the award winning children&apos;s app, Trashers and a tie-in with TV show Man vs Wild  but its next project could really be the one that thrusts it into the limelight. Blood of the Werewolf is an unashamedly hardcore platformer, seemingly in the blueprint of Konami&apos;s much-loved Castlevania series. You play Selena, a lupine mother who comes home one night to find her husband slaughtered and baby son missing  she must now traverse a rugged Gothic landscape to track him down and punish his kidnappers.            From the trailer, this has everything we expect from those classic platforming adventures  cruelly precise jumps, blood-splattered scenic traps and fast-paced combat. Selena is also able to transform into her werewolf alter ego, providing a savage claw attack to slice and dice enemies ranging from vampires to Frankenstein-esque abominations.  The game is due out this summer on Xbox Live, PSN, Wii U and PC.",

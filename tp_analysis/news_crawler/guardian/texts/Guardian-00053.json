I lost hours of sleep over feeling not clever enough, constantly weighing the option of dropping out against my lack of any plan B. I trudged through the university process, eventually finishing my first year  which was meant to be the fun year  with little enthusiasm for the future. But that summer, everything changed. Desperate to break free from my gloomy existence, I applied to work as a senior mentor for the National Citizen Service, a kind of condensed Duke of Edinburgh programme for 15- to 17-year-olds. I was accepted, and was soon in a job for the first time since my year 9 paper round.    Related: How to find valuable work experience while you study    It was the perfect summer job: it was well paid, not boring and fairly easy. The experience bolstered my self-confidence, and added a much-needed bullet point to my CV. Both helped in a later successful application to intern at the Raindance Film Festival: a fun few weeks and another bullet point.  My university holidays have proved to be distracting yet productive, the antidote to the all the drudgery of term time. But you obviously dont need to be a struggling student like me to get something special out of your holidays. Tom Fenton, a fourth year studying history, pushed the boat out further than most by spending his free months working with NGOs around the world. He travelled to Cyprus, Kosovo, Israel and the Palestinian territories.  I learned an incredible amount, he says. It was extremely tough, but challenges are good if you can overcome them and I am so glad I was able to do that. Toms experiences leave him well placed to offer advice when it comes to applying. Make opportunities yourself. Its a slog, it will take ages, youll be running into all sorts of cul-de-sacs, and it can be very demoralising.  But you dont just come out of your university time with a degree; the experiences it gives you are far more important than being able to recite the words of some pompous philosopher, he says. Get out there  have an experience.   Related: Got a 2:2? Don't panic, get some work experience    Most universities give you around five months off a year. Kate Wetherell, a third-year physics student, had three empty summer months in her calendar. Thats a lot of time to have on your hands. She decided to use it to start her own jewellery business from scratch.  Its been an amazing experience, she says. I gained a load of transferable skills, from communication and customer service, to organisation, self-motivation and market awareness. My advice to anyone who is a bit stuck is not to panic. Anyone who has a unique idea can start up a small business, and the summer is the perfect time to try it. In 2015 alone, a record 592,290 applications to study were submitted to Ucas. That means we all have a heck of a lot of competition for employment once we graduate. So how do you stand out from the ever-growing crowd of graduates? The answer is easy: spend your holidays doing something different.

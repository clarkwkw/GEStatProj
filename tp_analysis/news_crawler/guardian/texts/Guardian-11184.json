    "text": "Google has celebrated the 120th anniversary of the Nutcracker with a doodle depicting scenes from the ballet. The ballet, scored by Tchaikovsky and set around Christmas, was first performed alongside his opera Iolanta at the Mariinsky theatre in St Petersburg on 18 December 1892, but was poorly received. It was not until the 1950s, when George Balanchine re-imagined the choreography, that it became a major international hit. The story of Clara and Hans Peter being whisked off to the Kingdom of the Sweets was first seen in England in 1934, before reaching the US ten years later. Nowadays the Nutcracker is performed by ballet companies around the globe, commonly over the festive period. On top of the countless live performances, there have been various film adaptations, including a 1993 version starring Macaulay Culkin and narrated by Kevin Kline.",

    "text": "My former teacher Andrew Morgan, who has died aged 88, was ever ready to challenge the often complacent assumptions among his students with a combination of humour, gentleness and firmness. As the history teacher at Sedbergh school, in Cumbria, he encouraged us to read the New Statesman  unusual in a boys&apos; public school at that time. An inspired teacher, he brought history alive through his erudition and commitment, showing himself to be a compassionate, rounded individual upon whom we could model ourselves. His pupils included Tom Bingham (later Lord Bingham of Cornhill), Christopher Bland (who became a BBC chairman) and Robert Rhodes James (later a Conservative MP for Cambridge). Andrew was born in Aberystwyth, the son of a teacher. Educated at Tonbridge school, in Kent, where he was head boy, he went straight into the navy. He served with distinction in submarines and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. After reading history at Queen&apos;s College, Oxford (1945-48), he was appointed at Sedbergh. Andrew said he finally felt suffocated by the attitudes of some of the staff there, and he left Sedbergh in 1964 to become head of a small boys&apos; grammar, De Aston school in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, where he was reputedly a brilliant headteacher  colleagues and former pupils have written about Andrew&apos;s continued deep influence on their lives. The cornerstone of his career was undoubtedly to take the school co-educational, then comprehensive, as it expanded from 300 to more than 1,200 pupils. With a deft political touch, and a combination of warmth, relaxed manner and exacting standards, he succeeded in merging two schools that were more than the sum of their parts. Horrified by mediocrity, he ensured that pupils of all abilities received due attention, continuing to teach them himself. His social commitment over a lifetime was recognised with an MBE for &quot;services to agricultural wages&quot;; he had chaired a Lincolnshire committee which worked to ensure fair wages for agricultural workers in the days before the introduction of the minimum wage. After retiring in 1984, Andrew became an educational adviser in Lincolnshire for two years. He then set off with Jilyan, whom he had married in 1950, on a trip around England and Wales to explore the history of their families; this led to him producing a massive work, Swavis Mongrelian (the name combines different parts of their families). He never lost his interest in ideas and was reading and corresponding with his friends to the end. He is survived by Jilyan, their children, Lokadhi, Taradasa, Sarah and Rachel, and four grandchildren.",

The one-page policy memo from Public Safety Canada, updated in mid-January, attempts to dissuade government BlackBerry users from sending a PIN-to-PIN message largely because it could be read by any BlackBerry user, anywhere in the world. The messages are &quot;the most vulnerable method of communicating on a BlackBerry,&quot; a Public Safety Canada presentation says Political staffers use the device as well,regularly sending PIN-to-PIN messages and emails asgovernment business has progressively migrated to mobile devices. &quot;Although PIN-to-PIN messages are encrypted, they key used is a global cryptographic &apos;key&apos; that is common to every BlackBerry device all over the world,&quot; the memo reads. &quot;Any BlackBerry device can potentially decrypt all PIN-to-PIN messages sent by any other BlackBerry device.&quot;  You wonder whether certain governments have been granted access to that cryptographic key, don&apos;t you? Apple censoring iCloud emails and attachments &gt;&gt; Macworld UK  Apple&apos;s iCloud email service deletes all emails that contain the phrase &quot;barely legal teen&quot; it was revealed today.   Experiences seem to vary. It does for me (sending from Gmail to iCloud). It doesn&apos;t, for example for Jared Earle. Google helped honour FTC chairman during agency inquiry &gt;&gt; Bloomberg  Google contributed $25,000 to honor the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission while the company was under investigation by the agency for antitrust violations, Senate records show. Google donated the money to Common Sense Media Inc., a San Francisco-based advocacy group that gave FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz an award for his work in developing policies to help children, according to a January disclosure report. Google was listed as one of the sponsors of the awards ceremony along with several other companies, including Comcast Corp., AOL Inc. and a charitable arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. At the time, the FTC was investigating whether Mountain View, California-based Google unfairly disadvantaged competing websites by favoring its own services in search results. The agency ended the 20-month antitrust probe on Jan. 3 with no enforcement action.   Google declined to comment. It was notable that FTC staff wanted to take action against Google; that stalled when deliberation got to the five commissioners. FTC-Google public comments round-up #2: Tech companies have their say &gt;&gt; The Essential Patent Blog  While these companies all appear to agree that at least in most cases, injunctions for infringement of FRAND-pledged standard-essential patents should not be available, the parties pretty clearly diverge into two camps when it comes to many other issues (including a complete bar on injuctions)  with Apple/Microsoft on one side and Ericsson/Qualcomm/RIM on the other.  Unsurprising. But the thing about SEPs is that you don&apos;t need an injunction to get paid. You get a court-ordered arbitration. If someone won&apos;t go with that, they&apos;re not a &quot;willing licensee&quot;, and so you can injunct them - as the FTC allows. The complaints are coming from companies that want to use their SEPs to attack others. (Thanks @HotSoup for the link.) Samsung denies hiring UK judge who ruled in their favour &gt;&gt; Macworld UK  Samsung has issued a statement to Macworld claiming that it has not employed the judge who last year ruled in their favour in the UK legal battle with Apple. Samsung told Macworld: &quot;Sir Robin Jacob is not a legal representative of Samsung Electronics. A highly reputed intellectual property expert and academic, Sir Robin has been contracted as an expert by a law firm that represents Samsung Electronics in its case against Ericsson.&quot;  There&apos;s really nothing to this story. Jacob isn&apos;t involved in a case against Apple; it isn&apos;t in the UK; he was one of three judges in the UK appeal; he&apos;s an esteemed intellectual property expert. Samsung&apos;s legal company has contacted a company which provides IP experts. That&apos;s about it. (Thanks @rquick for the link.)

FOSS Patents: Japanese ruling in Apple&apos;s favor is Samsung&apos;s 22nd failed assertion of a standard-essential patent  Various news agencies including AFP report on a statement that Samsung sent to the media, according to which statement the company lost a cellular standard-essential patent (SEP) lawsuit against Apple in Japan. No infringement was found, which suggests that the patent wasn&apos;t as essential as Samsung thought it was Of the 25 SEP assertions by Samsung against Apple that have either been dropped or come to judgment by now, only three have been successful: two in Samsung&apos;s own country (South Korea) and a third one in the Netherlands, where injunctive relief (which Samsung was also pursuing in Japan, while it has meanwhile withdrawn its European SEP-based injunction requests) had been ruled out beforehand and Samsung will receive only a minor amount of damages. Today&apos;s loss in Japan is the 22nd SEP assertion that went nowhere.  SEPs really aren&apos;t weapons in the way that some companies thought. Galaxy Note 2  copy bug update &gt;&gt; Terence Eden  Last week I blogged about a pretty severe flaw in some of Samsung&apos;s phones. If you use copy &amp;#038; paste too many times - the phone reboots or resets. So, I ranted and raved on my blog and in the press. Samsung wouldn&apos;t respond to me - either through customer support or through their PR team. Nice way to treat a paying customer, guys! There is an OTA update for the Galaxy Note II - taking it to 4.1.2. Sadly this isn&apos;t yet being pushed out via all UK carriers (including O2, who I work for). As far as I can tell, the update does fix the bug. I&apos;ve only been trying it for an hour - but it seems that copying no longer crashes the device.  The Glass Bicycle &gt;&gt; Dustin Curtis  When I see the Google Glass UI sitting in the upper right hand corner of my vision, I think of it as potentially being one of the greatest tools man has ever come up with. It&apos;s the true bicycle for our minds. It&apos;ll make everyone smarter, faster, and better connected. It takes away the clunky interface of the computer, and it brings the world&apos;s information directly to your mind. The difference between Wikipedia twenty seconds away in your pocket and the answer to your question instantly and unobtrusively in your vision is enormous. When you&apos;re first shown the future, it&apos;s hard to see it. If you don&apos;t immediately use some imagination to evolve what you&apos;re being shown into what it can or will become, you might dismiss it as something frivolous or a mere curiosity. You might even call it a toy. Microsoft built an absurd $10,000 table. Apple built a $499 tablet for everyone. Glass will play out the same way, I think, but it might be Google that makes the product for everyone.

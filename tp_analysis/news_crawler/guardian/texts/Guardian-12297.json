    "text": "In the slum area of Jamestown  a fishing community in Accra&apos;s city centre littered with tattered colonial buildings  one house stands out. Painted bright yellow, with large windows, Brazil House stands between the hustle and bustle of the city and the windy Atlantic Ocean. The house was built by the Tabom people  former African slaves who left, or were deported from, Brazil after slave revolts in 1835. Freed African-Brazilian slaves settled in many west African countries, but in Ghana they received a particularly warm welcome. Given land by a local chief, they settled around Jamestown, starting businesses, agricultural ventures and even trading slaves themselves. Brazil House has now been restored as a gesture of friendship between the governments of Ghana and Brazil, in recognition of their shared past. Relations between the two countries are described as excellent, and Brazil is investing heavily in mechanising Ghana&apos;s agriculture and food production, and in a $300m (190m) hydroelectric dam project, as well as providing aid. Historical relics such as Brazil House have played their part in attracting thousands of people from the African diaspora  across South America, the Caribbean, the US and Europe  to live and set up shop in Ghana. &quot;There&apos;s unlimited opportunity in Ghana,&quot; says David Baldwin Barnes, 30, a US-based entrepreneur of Jamaican and Haitian descent, and president of agriculture firm Solve, which provides services and consulting to farmers and &quot;agripreneurs&quot; in Ghana. &quot;[But] starting a business in Ghana is challenging for someone who is unfamiliar with the societal mentality that influences behaviour across all sectors of life, including how business is done,&quot; he adds. &quot;It&apos;s not the amount of bureaucracy that&apos;s the issue, it&apos;s the culture of the bureaucracy that you have to learn coming from a different business and regulatory environment.&quot; In 2007, the Ghanaian government celebrated the 50th anniversary of independence and the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade with the Joseph Project, which encouraged the African diaspora to visit Ghana. A Right to Abode Act was passed in 2001 giving members of the African diaspora the right to live and work in Ghana, the first legislation of this kind by an African country. &quot;We have helped the diaspora to come to Ghana by this piece of legislation, which enables them to live and work here without the need for a visa,&quot; says Ebenezer Appreku, legal director at the foreign affairs ministry. However, many complain that while Ghanaian governments have appeared welcoming to the diaspora, that has not always translated into policy to smooth the process of working in Ghana. &quot;We have been frustrated by red tape,&quot; says Cassandra Davis, 58, from the US, who moved to the country with her husband in 2011. &quot;We are entitled to residency, the right to work, the right to abode, but it takes a long time.&quot; Government policy on &quot;returnees&quot; has been increasingly looking to more recent Ghanaian migrants  many of whom are skilled workers who left the country during economic turmoil seeking opportunities in Europe and the US. &quot;The government has identified Ghanaians in the diaspora as a priority area, to strengthen their relationship, and to harness their skills and expertise through returning home or contributing remittances,&quot; says Dyane Epstein, mission chief of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). &quot;Six countries in particular  the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Canada  tend to have large numbers of Ghanaian professionals and academics.&quot; The IOM has been working with the Ghanaian government to establish a diaspora support unit (DSU) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with funding from the German government, to help Ghanaian migrants strengthen ties with the country. That relationship has not always gone smoothly. &quot;Ghanaians abroad have experienced problems when they have tried to send charitable donations here,&quot; says Appreku, who leads the DSU. &quot;Now we intervene to help with the clearance.&quot; Work to support the diaspora is hampered by a lack of basic data on its size. Estimates put the number of Ghanaians abroad at between 1 million and 3 million  but that does not include the unknown numbers who have already returned. The IOM is working with the government and the European commission to try to improve data collection on migration. What is known is that Ghanaians living overseas sent home about $119m in remittances in 2011. Migrants from the broader African diaspora face a bigger struggle finding acceptance in Ghana. Many feel that although the Right of Abode act goes some way to paving the way for their return, much more needs to be done to allow them to integrate into society. Anecdotal evidence from associations created for people from the diaspora who move to Ghana suggests their numbers are rising. &quot;As far as the numbers of African-Americans in Ghana are concerned, we don&apos;t have any figures, but I estimate it to be at least in the thousands,&quot; says Davis. &quot;But this year we are getting a record number of inquiries to our website from people saying they are thinking of moving to Ghana in 2013. I think this year is really going to set a precedent for numbers of returnees.&quot;",

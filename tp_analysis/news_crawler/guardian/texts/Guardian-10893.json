    "text": "Deep frustration with the low ambition of rich countries to cut emissions and help developing countries with money to adapt to climate change bubbled over on Wednesday with diplomats urging each other to act in the last hours before the climate change talks close on Friday. Finance for 2013-20 has emerged as the most contentious issue with the US, China, India and the EU all at loggerheads. So far, only Britain and Germany, among more than 20 rich countries, have pledged to provide cash until 2015 or after. In a move that angered developing countries, the US argued that it is not obliged to provide any more cash until 2020. &quot;There was voluntary agreement [by rich countries] to provide $30bn by 2012 and to mobilise $100bn by 2020. We did the first and we are working on the second. We are doing what we committed to do,&quot; the US chief negotiator Jonathan Pershing said. Developing countries were also infuriated at rich countries&apos; refusal to pledge further emission cuts. &quot;Countries cannot sit here without an increase in ambition; it would not be responsible. Some  actually dropped to the low end of their ambition ranges, which have led small island states to ask, &apos;Why is this?&apos; Please tell small island states what conditions have not been met? Why can&apos;t they move to the top end of their pledge ranges here in Doha?&quot; said St Lucia ambassador Edwin Laurent on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. &quot;We are past the era of mitigation and adaptation. What comes next is the disappearance of islands. We are in an era of mass relocations,&quot; said Ronny Jumeau, Seychelles ambassador. But Greenpeace director Kumi Naidoo said: &quot;Just weeks ago, President Obama&apos;s post-election victory speech displayed a vision of a second-term priority for addressing climate change. [The US negotiators] have come to Doha with their needle stuck in the groove of obstructing the UN process, an art they have perfected. &quot;It is disrespectful of President Obama to inflict on us negotiators who act as if the comments he made after his election were never made.&quot; With only a few hours of negotiating time left, there are many areas that still need to be resolved by politicians, said China&apos;s chief negotiator Su Wei. &quot;The core issue is finance,&quot; he said. &quot;If we can solve that then we have a good foundation for others.&quot; Speaking on behalf of the EU, Pete Betts said: &quot;We would like to see more ambition from the US and all other countries.&quot; India said the problem with finance was to fulfil the pledges already made rather than enhancing ambition. Mira Mehrishi, a deputy minister in the environment ministry, said: &quot;No funds have flown to the green climate fund despite three years of its creation. This is one task that must engage our greatest attention. Resources need to be found and provided without casting a burden on those who are adversely affected by climate change. This is a matter of urgency.&quot; Countries were optimistic that the final package would include a second commitment period for the Kyoto protocol, the only international agreement that obliges rich countries to reduce emissions. However, New Zealand, Russia, Japan and Canada have pulled out, leaving only the EU, Australia, Norway and Switzerland. &quot;The Kyoto protocol is the fundamental basis for ensuring ambition in the whole climate change regime. There can be no further quid pro quo. Our call is unequivocal. No more conditions. No more delays,&quot; said a Filipino negotiator. Other European countries were expected to follow Britain and Germany with financial pledges on Wednesday, possibly breaking the diplomatic deadlock. &quot;Finance will make the deal at Doha,&quot; said Matthias Groote, chair of the European parliament environment committee. &quot;It is the burning issue, the key to bringing developing countries aboard. It needs to be addressed urgently.&quot;",

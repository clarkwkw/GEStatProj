Image: Roy Hill, 5 January 2012 (with permission) [velociraptorize].Canon EOS 5D Mark II Lens 135 f/2. exposure ISO200, f/8, 1/800s    Question: Several of this British mystery bird&apos;s natural history traits may surprise those who only have a passing familiarity with them. What do you find to be most surprising about this species? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: These are common starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, in flight. They are recognizable in this image from their silhouette; short, blunt-ended tail, sharply pointed wings, and a long, thin bill.  Starlings are medium-sized Old World passerines that are placed into the family, Sturnidae. Many species forage for grubs and other squishy delights by &quot;open-bill probing&quot; where they jam their bill into the soil or a crevice and forcefully expand the hole by opening their beak to expose prey. Most starling species are monomorphic, and they are quite handsome fellows as most species are clad in dark iridescent plumage.  Starlings are particularly talented singers and mimics that seem to collect sounds just as some people collect stamps or coins. This ability has made them popular research subjects into the neurobiology of song and the evolution of human language. A friend of mine who raises birds removes starling chicks from their nests to hand-rear and sell them for pets, referring to them as the &quot;poor-man&apos;s myna bird&quot;.  Native to Eurasia, the common starling was introduced by idiot humans into many places throughout the world where their populations have exploded and where they aggressively out-compete native birds for nest cavities. Basically, common starlings live where ever people live in North and South America, Hawaii and New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, Fiji, and a number of Caribbean islands, where they are generally reviled as pests and are considered to be invasive species. They also are common where ever there are grassy areas, such as farmland, pastures, playing fields, golf courses, and airfields. According to the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), common starlings have steeply declined by more than 80% between 1966 and 2004 in most parts of the UK. In England, their numbers have declined even more dramatically [read more].  You&apos;ve met other starlings before on this blog:  The seventh starling (Murmuration) (includes videos of huge starling flocks, poetry, and a paper that explains how they fly in such large, dense flocks without crashing)  Greater blue-eared glossy-starling, Lamprotornis chalybaeus  Brahminy starling, Sturnia pagodarum You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

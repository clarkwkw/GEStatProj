    "text": "In 2007 the Independent Scientific Group reported on TB in cattle (Starting gun for Britain&apos;s badger shoot, 17 September). The two conclusions were that culling badgers could make no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain and that the rising incidence of disease can be reversed, and geographical spread contained, by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone. To reach this conclusion took 10 years, cost 50m and was undertaken by six professors and a knight of the realm. A document on the Defra website shows that the recently departed secretary of state, Caroline Spelman, consulted a different set of nine professors (with the exception of Professor Christl Donnelly). This group met with Defra&apos;s chief scientific adviser in April 2011. The meeting&apos;s conclusion may be summarised thus: after nine years, five years of culling and 4.5 years post cull, there is a 95% probability that the decrease in new outbreaks would be around 16%. In other words, after slaughtering most of the badgers the problem would not be solved, but would be one-sixth smaller.Ivor AnnettsTiverton, Devon  So far, small-scale dairy farmers have been put out of business by the uneconomic prices that milk processors and supermarkets pay for their milk. There is now talk of setting up &quot;super-herds&quot;, where cows will live indoors all their lives in huge, mechanical milk factories. Small-scale dairy farmers, we are told, will soon be only a folk memory. Offering farmers the chance to shoot badgers in order to save their soon-to-be-redundant small outdoor herds is a piece of cynical nonsense on the part of the government. Agribusiness can&apos;t wait for these small farmers to go. When the badger culls have failed to stop the spread of bovine TB, as they are bound to, big businesses will sell the advantages of super-herd factories to the public on the basis that their milk comes from nice, clean, TB-free, indoor milk factories. And they won&apos;t have to bother about the NFU either.Angela BogleBakewell, Derbyshire   How will Defra know when 70% of badgers in the trial culling zones have been killed, when they have no way of knowing the total badger population? Even the most recent estimate took place back in 1997 and was based on counting numbers of setts. The slaughter of hundreds of thousands of badgers, described by the leading expert on bovine tuberculosis, Lord Krebs, as crazy, is neither science-led policy-making or likely to help dairy farmers cope with this devastating disease.Ed BaileySt Albans, Hertfordshire   Every reasonable countryman wants healthy wildlife and healthy livestock. At long last we have a minister with thecourage of his convictions to tackle the problem. Only time will tell whetherhe is right or wrong, but he deserves credit for taking action  and not sitting feebly on his hands as his predecessors have done.David OwenBovingdon, Hertfordshire  No more British milk, butter or cheese for me until this badger madness has been stopped.Iain McIntoshWinchester, Hampshire ",

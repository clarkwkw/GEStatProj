    "text": "There was a moment in the Dark Souls 2 presentation in New York last week that I feel aptly sums up the entire aesthetic of From Software&apos;s belligerently difficult RPG series. Picture the scene: an armour-clad warrior is walking down a dimly lit hallway in a medieval castle. His footsteps clank against the paving stones, echoing into the bowl of darkness in the roof high above him and cutting through the wind whispering ominously through his surroundings. A growl sounds off to his left. He turns and sees a solid wooden door with thick bars set in a window in one of its upper panels. Through the bars, he can see a gigantic beast moving about in the next room. The beast is humanoid in shape, but its arms and legs are as thick as tree trunks. In essence, it looks like what would happen if you spliced a rhino with an armadillo. Its face is a mass of teeth and hatred. The warrior produces a bow, strings an arrow and fires it through the bars of the door into the monster&apos;s head. Now, in most other games of this type, players could use the barrier provided by the door to kill off their quarry safely. They&apos;d simply fire arrow after arrow, removing the creature&apos;s health as it scrabbled against a piece of the environment, which prevented it from reaching them. This doesn&apos;t happen in Dark Souls 2. Once the first arrow enters its skull, the monster starts hammering its huge noggin against the door. On its third blow, the door is reduced to kindling and the monster advances on the warrior with the plain intention of turning him into paint. Death is just the beginning     Dark Souls 2 fight    You see, in Dark Souls 2  as was the case in the first Dark Souls  there are no easy confrontations. There are no battles one can simply walk through and every enemy is horribly lethal. The entire game is built from the ground up like a minefield. According to From Software&apos;s director of Dark Souls 2, Yui Tanimura, the starting point of the development cycle begins with death. &quot;I try to concrete the concept of what I want the player to feel,&quot; he said. &quot;Then I try to design different types of deaths they will face and what kind of challenges they will face and what kind of tactics we want them to learn.&quot; Every death, then, in Dark Souls 2 should be looked at as a learning experience  just as in the first title. For instance, Tanimura tells us, firing arrows at Mr ArmaRhino will likely &quot;piss him off&quot;. Darks Souls 2 boasts a reactive AI that adjusts to what the player does both immediately and tactically. For example, in an earlier stage of the demo, we watched as a warrior ran into a pair of armoured brutes in a corridor. Initially, the player controlling the warrior tried to roll to one side of them and attack from behind. The target in question, however, waited for a split second and then reacted to the blow against its hind quarters by hurling itself backwards onto its attacker. The warrior was flattened and a sizeable chunk of his health was removed. It wasn&apos;t long before the two brutes finished him off. &quot;We wanted to implement as many [AI] reactions to player actions as possible, so that players will be forced to think up their own strategies to get past certain parts of the game,&quot; says Tanimura. Players will also activate objects in their environment in Dark Souls 2. In one example, a player picked up a glowing item in an atrium decorated with the bones of a dragon. Once they did, the skeleton of a winged monster behind them shuddered to life and made an attempt to swallow the player whole. In another instance, a player activated something called a Key Mouth by placing an item in what appeared to be the mouth of a face carved in stone set in a wall. Once they did this, the hallway they were standing in was flooded with warm light from torches bursting into flame at intervals along the walls. The latter mechanic looks like it may come in handy because Dark Souls 2, it seems, will be closer in spirit to the aesthetic of a survival horror game than its predecessor. At intervals in the demo, the player guided the warrior on screen into passages where the darkness engulfed them. Only a few steps ahead in the passage were visible and the only sounds one could hear was the ever-present wind and the footsteps of the player&apos;s avatar. In these instances, we were told, players will have to choose between either daring to move through an environment they literally can&apos;t see in, or use a torch to light their way forward. Doing this, however, will mean they&apos;re be unable to wield a sword and shield at the same time, which, as any Dark Soul veteran will tell you, is taking a rather a big risk. Mind you, players take a risk by turning a corner, stepping onto a bridge or walking through one of the game&apos;s many swirling portals. Dark Souls 2 offers players some familiar trappings in the form of bonfire save-points and Covenant perks  although we are told you won&apos;t be able to import your character from Dark Souls across. But above all, Dark Souls 2 is a deadly beast of a game  as if we expected anything different. Life isn&apos;t fair     Dark Souls 2 bridge    During the demo, the words YOU DIED appeared on the screen around five or six times  and the presentation itself lasted only 10 or so minutes. And if you ever felt a twinge of incredulity at the unfairness of it all during Dark Souls (or its spiritual predecessor, Demon&apos;s Souls), you had better prepare yourself. In one scene, the player was sent falling to his death after a Wyvern ripped a bridge he was walking across in pieces; when this occurred, the player was halfway across and the creature who caused his death flew in from offscreen without any warning at all. In another scene, a player was run over by a glowing chariot that came hurtling through a tunnel, which was too narrow to allow for any space to avoid it. Naturally these examples prompted knowing laughter from the journalists in attendance, but you had to wonder how on earth players were expected to conquer these sections in the final game. But then, we spent many of the early hours of Dark Souls feeling the same things. You live (eventually) and you learn. Indeed, according to Tanimura, both scenarios can be beaten and in both instances, death is meant to act as a tutor. The aim here, he said, was to teach the player something. Hints, tips and clues will be dotted around to help us move forward and ultimately, the goal is to make the player realise that their expectations are flawed  not their desire to move forward. &quot;No matter what sort of deaths the player to experiences,&quot; said Tanimura, &quot;the player needs to understand the reason that they died.&quot; That is Dark Souls 2  and indeed, Dark Souls  in a nutshell. This is a game in which death moves the player forward. If you don&apos;t learn from adversity, you don&apos;t deserve to move forward. Kind of like life ",

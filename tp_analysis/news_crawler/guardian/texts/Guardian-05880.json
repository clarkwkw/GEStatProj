    "text": "Donald Nicholson, who has died aged 96, mapped the intricate relationships of the metabolic pathways in the body, and the interactions between complex organic chemicals and the various bodily functions and diseases. Eight years after he started teaching at Leeds medical school in 1946, only about 20 pathways, for making or breaking down biological molecules such as sugars or amino acids, had been charted. Donald&apos;s inspiration was that these maps revealed vastly more when put together: in 1955 he drew his first combined chart by hand and had it printed in an architect&apos;s office. From then until just a couple of weeks before his death, he added in the huge numbers of new pathways that biochemists were discovering  currently there are thousands  and progressively improved their presentation. Recently, 22 editions and more than 1m copies later, the paper maps made way for &quot;animaps&quot;, whose computer animations displayed the various reactions in progress and allowed students to seek out increasing detail while retaining the overall picture. One map, for instance, shows how genes can go wrong and lead to abnormal enzymes and consequent disease.     Donald Nicholson    As a teacher, Donald delighted in demonstrating the elegance and symmetry of these processes, and was horrified when his charts were used as exam fodder. For him, the vital principle was that they should enable the student to understand, not just to learn, the metabolic interactions, and he would proudly show me the letters of thanks he had received from medical students all over the world. Donald loved to recount how mentors had helped him benefit from setbacks, and was always supportive of students who were struggling academically. His own schooling  and that of his twin brother, Kenneth  was disrupted by the repeated moves imposed on their father, a Methodist minister; they were born in Leek, Staffordshire. Donald had to resit his school certificate exams at Kingswood school, Bath, and in 1936 scraped a degree in chemistry at Huddersfield technical college. He took a research job at ICI in Huddersfield, and in 1940 gained a PhD. During the second world war he worked at Boots in Nottingham, putting into large-scale production the new antibacterial drug sulfanilamide, which saved thousands of wounded servicemen from life-threatening infections. After the war, ICI offered him a research fellowship, which he applied to take up at the Leeds medical school. He was offered a post in the bacteriology department, and, as its only chemist, went on to undertake what was seen as the chore of teaching bacterial metabolism. He never stopped, despite taking official retirement 35 years later. In 1997 Huddersfield University gave him an honorary doctorate. Donald&apos;s wife, Celia, suffered from a progressive illness and was fearful of electrical devices, so it was only after her death in 1996 that Donald owned a personal computer. But then, dispensing with the need to &quot;stick millions of little pieces of paper on to one big sheet of paper&quot;, he set about digitising the maps. Immensely proud of how little money he made from them, he gave the copyright to the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, which now makes them freely available on the internet. Donald was a progressive, critical and unconventional Christian, keen to reveal the wonder of the natural world and the human potential for love, but critical of dogma and of belief in the supernatural. As a Methodist lay preacher for more than two decades from 1939, he illustrated points of faith with scientific tricks. In recent years he hosted a discussion group within the Progressive Christian Network. Until a couple of months ago his daily walk in nearby Roundhay park produced spectacular photographs  to Donald, not just pictures of pretty plants, but tributes to the miracle of chlorophyll synthesising sugars from sunlight. He kept friends and neighbours not only impressed, but amused; you could meet him in the park and immediately fall into a discussion of the differences between hawkbit and dandelion. He is survived by his brother Basil, his children, Rosemary, Roger and Ruth, three grandchildren and a great-grandson.  Donald Elliot Nicholson, biochemist, born 16 January 1916; died 12 May 2012",

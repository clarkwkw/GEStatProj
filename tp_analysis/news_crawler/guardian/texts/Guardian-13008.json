    "text": "In this cold weather, it lifts the spirits to see carpets of bright golden flowers of gorse bushes ablaze across commons, heaths, hedgerows, roadsides and derelict land. Gorse flowers are at their best around this time of year although they stay in flower most of the year, hence the saying &quot;When gorse is out of bloom, kissing is out of season&quot;. When the sun shines bright, the flowers smell of a heady aroma of coconut and vanilla that makes a wonderful flavouring for wine, although picking the flowers amongst the minefield of thorns on the bushes is difficult. There are signs of early spring flowers emerging, although the weather this winter has been so capricious that plants are making slow progress. Lesser celandine, sweet violet, winter aconite and early primroses are also showing signs of blooming, but the recent cold snap has put them on hold, again. However, snowdrops came out in the mild spells over the past few weeks, and lived up to their name as they poked up in the snow. Even some garden daffodils came into bloom before the bitter cold returned, although wild daffodils will not appear until next month, if it is warm enough. The shiny yellow flowers of lesser celandine have managed to come out in many parts of England and Wales. They look like buttercups with their bright yellow petals and were once known as pilewort because they were used to treat haemorrhoids.",

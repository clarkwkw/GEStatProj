    "text": "Doing anything ridiculous this weekend? I am. As part of the London Games Festival, I&apos;ll be participating in a 48-hour game jam, in which journalists will be writing the games, with the help of student programmers, while a selection of established indie developers will act as journalists, writing previews and interviews as the madness progresses.  &quot;The idea came to me when I was writing a blog to deadline for Develop at this year&apos;s GDC,&quot; says organiser and veteran developer, Will Luton. &quot;I thought &apos;we always bitch on journalists but these guys have a tough job&apos;. It was a small leap to swap the roles in a Game Hack  I put it to Twitter, the response was insane and Ukie and Develop pitched in to make it happen.&quot; I&apos;ll be competing against three other games writers: Rob Crossley from CVG, Lewie Procter from Savy Gamer and Dan Griliopoulos from Rock Paper Shotgun. The developers writing it all up are Andrew Smith from Spilt Milk Studios, Mike Bithell, creator of Thomas Was Alone, Peter Theophilus-Bevis from Blitz Studios and Jim Griffiths from Mediatonic. The action will kick off at 5pm on Friday when the organisers will reveal the theme of the jam. We&apos;ll then be &apos;coding&apos; (as I believe they say) until 5pm on Sunday. Gulp. I&apos;ll be live-blogging the event on Gamesblog  for just as long as I am able to construct coherent sentences. You&apos;ll also be able to follow the #journodevswap hash tag on Twitter.",

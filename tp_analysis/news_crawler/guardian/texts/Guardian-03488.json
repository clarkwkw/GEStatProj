    "text": "If there&apos;s one thing publishers love it&apos;s getting all their characters (or &apos;brands&apos; as they often prefer) into one game, thereby capturing a huge meta-demographic of avid fans. Capcom has its &apos;Vs&apos; series of fighting games, Sega has its All-Stars racing titles and Nintendo has  *deep breath* Super Smash Brothers, Mario Party, Mario Kart, Mario Tennis, Mario Sports Mix... etc. Now Sony is entering the multi-character fray with PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which has been rumoured for ages but only officially announced today. It&apos;s a four-player brawler for PS3 featuring well-known faces from throughout the entire history of the console. So if you&apos;ve ever wondered who would win in a fight between vengeful Spartan warrior Kratos and paper-thin rapping dog, PaRappa now&apos;s your chance to find out. I&apos;ll have a tenner on the one wielding the Blades of Athena. Other confirmed stars are Sly Copper, Colonel Radec from Killzone, Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal and Fat Princess from, erm, Fat Princess. Sackboy and Nathan Drake must be in the running to feature, too - although personally, I&apos;m hoping for Scott Shelby from Heavy Rain. Sony says that certain third-party stars will also feature. All characters will have their own special moves, of course, as well as themed environments. The music score will feature mash-ups of all our favourite soundtracks.  It&apos;s being developed by SuperBot Entertainment, a start-up studio in Culver City, California, and is due out this winter. We can  yes  expect more news at E3. I&apos;m going to get sick of writing that veeeery soon. So, any suggestions for other PlayStation characters to join the fight?",

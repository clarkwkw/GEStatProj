    "text": "Academic life has an added sparkle for the new provost of Nottingham University&apos;s Malaysia campus just outside the capital, Kuala Lumpur. Christine Ennew has been teaching in Malaysia on and off since 2000 when she and a handful of academic colleagues helped set up the overseas campus. &quot;Our unique selling point is we offer a British education but we are locally embedded. All our research priorities contribute to the region&apos;s economic priorities,&quot; says Ennew. In the early days Ennew lived in a rented apartment in Kuala Lumpur just half an hour&apos;s walk from the university&apos;s original city centre campus near the famous twin skyscrapers, the PetronasTowers. Malaysia is known for its relaxed multicultural lifestyle. Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Christian festivals are celebrated. &quot;We always have a dragon dance on campus at the start of the Chinese New Year and at the end of Ramadan there is a big public holiday, Hari Raya. For about a month after Ramadan individuals and organisations keep a tradition called &apos;open house&apos; to which everyone  even total strangers  are invited in for refreshments. It&apos;s like mulled wine and mince pies on Boxing Day but on an industrial scale. When the prime minister had open house about 10,000 people turned up. Can you imagine that happening in the UK?&quot; says Ennew. The year-round sun and a mild monsoon season are an attraction for UK academics headhunted by local universities. &quot;I find the heat wraps around you and the vibrant greenery is really uplifting,&quot; says Ennew. Warm evenings are ideal for eating out and streets are crowded with food stalls. &quot;In Malaysia you don&apos;t say, &apos;good afternoon&apos; you say &apos;have you eaten?&apos;&quot; she says. Food is a big part of the culture and socialising means getting together for a meal. &quot;One of the things in Malaysia is how cheap it is to eat out well. Street food is amazing. There are samosas, roti  which is a type of bread; murtabak  a type of filled pancake, and satay, obviously  mainly chicken or lamb on skewers.&quot; Low-cost travel is another perk of the expat lifestyle. &quot;The Malays were the first to introduce budget airlines and you can easily travel to Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos for the weekend,&quot; says Ennew. &quot;Malaysia is very upbeat and its universities are expanding as the government invests in building an international higher education and research hub.

    "text": "The greenness has been drained out of pastures by the frosts, ferns in the wood have wilted, and early camellia flowers have been browned. Looking down from market gardens near Boetheric, an exposed length of the Tamar, known as Hospital Reach, appears grey like the lichen-covered branches in Braunder Wood opposite. No sunlight reflects on the bare mudbanks but the adjoining pale reed beds glow dimly in the murk of late afternoon. A chill wind blows across from faded slopes on the Devon side, rustling pittosporum bushes and the wispy growth of blue-green eucalyptus. The flat ground below is protected from flooding by a levee which has to be maintained and periodically strengthened against the highest tides. Built originally to improve navigation along the meandering tidal river, this bank is now valued as a landscape feature, and controversy erupts whenever there are suggestions of breaching it and allowing land to revert to an expanse of watery marsh. In my grandparents&apos; youth, more than a century ago, this stretch of river was regularly dredged to maintain an open channel for traffic bringing dock dung, coal, limestone, timber and groceries to be unloaded at Cotehele and Halton Quay. Grain, bought at the Corn Exchange in Plymouth, was shipped upriver on the miller&apos;s barge, Myrtle, and carted to the mill at Cotehele. Farmers and growers took their produce aboard paddle steamers to go to market downriver at Devonport, while ferrymen rowed chip baskets of strawberries across the river, to be sent by train from Bere Alston to London. Earlier in the 19th century vessels from overseas had sailed up and down the eastern boundary of this agricultural parish to load ore, stone, bricks and tiles brought from mines, quarries and works miles farther up the winding river. Today no boat is in sight, but the local gig crew may practise at the weekend and a friend who kayaks at first light will paddle out on a high tide when it is less cold.  ",

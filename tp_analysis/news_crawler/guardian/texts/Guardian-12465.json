    "text": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Mobile attacks! &gt;&gt; Securelist  Users of inexpensive Android smartphones typically look for ways to accelerate their devices, for example, by freeing up memory. Demand for software that makes smartphones work a little faster creates supply, some of which happens to be malicious. In addition to legitimate applications, apps that only pretend to clean up the system have appeared on Google Play.   This is a very stealthy infection, which in effect uses the phone as a USB key to infect your (Windows) PC. Before you get excited about that &quot;free super Wi-Fi&quot; story... &gt;&gt; SplatF Dan Frommer:   &quot;Imagine a free WiFi network spanning the country. The feds want it to happen, wireless cos don&apos;t.&quot; That&apos;s NYT media reporter Brian Stelter&apos;s tweet this morning, linking to a Washington Post article by Cecilia Kang. Sounds amazing! Probably too amazing.  Jailbreak your iPhone 5 (and other iOS 6 devices) - finally! &gt;&gt; ReadWrite  Nearly five months after Apple shipped iOS 6, an untethered jailbreak for the operating system is now available. Unlike its predecessor, the Evasi0n iOS 6 jailbreak tool works on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux at launch. The release of Evasi0n has been highly anticipated for owners of the iPhone 5 and fourth generation iPad, both of which shipped running iOS 6 by default. For others, the release means they can finally upgrade their devices to iOS 6 without losing the ability to download unauthorized apps and customize the look and feel of their iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.  Deal done to deliver quick internet connections &gt;&gt; Cambridge News  Superfast broadband will be rolled out across Cambridgeshire by 2015 after a multi-million pound contract was awarded.  British Telecom was today confirmed as the winning bidder for the project to deliver internet speeds of at least 24 megabits per second to 90% of homes and businesses in the next two years.   Thus reinforcing its monopoly that bit more solidly. The other 10%? 2Mbps or so. Dismal. Cupple&apos;s acquisition shows how UK startups can succeed outside London &gt;&gt; The Next Web Martin Bryant:   The argument that startups can thrive all over the UK, not just London, has been given a boost with the news over the weekend that Path-like private sharing app aimed at couples, Cupple has been acquired by similar Silicon Valley-based firm Pair (which is rebranding itself as Couple).  Given the noise that the UK government makes about the Tech City initiative in east London, you could be forgiven for thinking that there&apos;s no point basing a startup anywhere else. In actual fact, communities of startups have been quietly getting on with success stories all over the country. One of the most notable cities to host a startup cluster is Newcastle in the north of England, where Cupple was born in 2011 within the walls of creative agency Darling Dash.   Negative: sold out to US rival. Positive: founders have experience of successfully managing a company to an exit, and should have money to do it even better next time. Google Chrome&apos;s Netseer malware warning blocks websites, company says no virus distributed &gt;&gt; San Jose Mercury News For any Chrome users who had a warning while visiting here on Monday:   Malware warnings halted Internet users from visiting popular sites across the Internet on Monday morning, including the Mercury News, after Silicon Valley advertising company Netseer&apos;s website was hacked. The company said that its ads were not infected with any virus, and Google cleared the company and halted the malware warnings. According to Twitter users, sites such as The New York Times, The Huffington Post, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and many others were being blocked by Google&apos;s Chrome browser with warnings about possible malware - malicious software that could infect a user&apos;s computer -- emanating from Netseer.   However...   &quot;This morning at approximately 5:30 a.m. Pacific time, our third-party hosted corporate website(netseer.com) was hacked and infected with malware. Consequently, Google added our domain to the list of malware-affected websites. Our operations team went into all-hands-on-deck mode and we have successfully cleaned the site of the malware issue,&quot; spokeswoman Kathleen Formidoni said.  Because the company&apos;s corporate site and ad-serving infrastructure share the same domain, the block Google served to keep malware placed on Netseer&apos;s website from spreading also affected ads Netseer placed on other sites. However, &quot;the malware was never served into ad serving stream,&quot; Formidoni wrote in an email.  HP&apos;s first Chromebook arrives, offers a large screen and a small battery for $329.99 &gt;&gt; The Verge  It&apos;s called the HP Pavilion 14 Chromebook, and its distinguishing characteristic is right there in the name: unlike the first wave of Chromebooks with 11.6-inch and 12-inch screens, the Pavilion 14 has a 14-inch 1366 x 768 panel, and a correspondingly large laptop frame. HP hopes the larger keyboard and more spacious experience will contribute to improved ease of use. There&apos;s also a correspondingly larger array of ports, including three USB 2.0 sockets and an SD card slot so you can expand the included (tiny) 16GB of solid state storage should you so choose.   1.1GHz Celeron processor, 2GB RAM, integrated graphics. Battery life: about 4hr 30 - compared to six hours for a Samsung Chromebook in The Verge&apos;s test. Probably the bigger screen, but hardly an advance. BlackBerry Z10 off to a strong start in UK &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  According to channel checks conducted by Jefferies &amp; Co., preorders in the United Arab Emirates and Canada have so far been &quot;solid.&quot; More encouraging, though, are early reports from the UK, where Z10 sales are evidently off to a good start. Jefferies analyst Peter Misek reports lines outside a number of UK retailers selling the device, and says that sell-outs of the white Z10 have been widespread. The black Z10 is easier to come by, but Misek says that with that device, too, stocks are limited.  &quot;We believe Carphone Warehouse is seeing widespread sell-outs, while O2, Vodafone, Orange and EE are seeing robust demand,&quot; Misek explained. &quot;We estimate sell-in to be at least several hundred thousand units.&quot;   Translation: &quot;sell-in&quot; = units shipped to retailers. The custom pulp magazine cover generator &gt;&gt; PULP-O-MIZER There&apos;s no other word for this but fantastic. Game over: Twitter mentioned In 50% of Super Bowl commercials, Facebook only 8%, Google+ shut out &gt;&gt; Marketing Land Matt McGee analyses the ads on the US&apos;s most-watched scheduled event of the year:   According to my count, Twitter was mentioned in 26 of 52 national TV commercials -- that&apos;s 50% of the spots that aired during CBS&apos; game coverage. Facebook was mentioned in only four of those commercials -- about 8%. Google+, which is reportedly the No. 2 social network in the world, wasn&apos;t mentioned at all... When it comes to second-screen advertising, it&apos;s Twitter&apos;s world now and there&apos;s no close second place.  Last year, brands split their focus on Twitter and Facebook with eight mentions each. This year, brands recognize that Twitter is where they need to try to attract the online conversation around one of the world&apos;s biggest events.

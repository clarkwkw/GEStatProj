    "text": "The biggest problem facing indie developers in the digital era is discovery. With hundreds of new games hitting the Apple and Android stores every day, just getting noticed amid the onslaught is a major challenge. It can feel like a lonely struggle. Earlier this year, then, a bunch of UK studios got together to form Best of British, a sort of lose unofficial trade body, designed to provide support and co-operation between members. The likes of Spilt Milk, Mobile Pie, Future Games of London and Big Pixel have all produced great games, but are looking to raise awareness and increase exposure at a time in which hundreds of new, small developers are entering the iOS and Android markets.  &quot;Gaining exposure for our apps is a big challenge for any developer,&quot; says co-organiser Alistair Aitcheson, a one-man studio, responsible for the excellent Greedy Bankers games. &quot;However, by teaming up we can be part of something bigger, and share our audiences by introducing them to each other&apos;s work. We&apos;ve also been able to share contacts, advice and experience with the other developers, which has been invaluable for my business&quot;.  To solidify the relationship, the companies are meeting up this weekend for a 48 hour gamejam, being held at the offices of Mind Candy, the creators of Moshi Monsters. A couple of the studio&apos;s staff make indie games in their spare time, and managed to secure the canteen for the weekend. &quot;The mobile space is becoming harder and harder for indies to survive in,&quot; says one of the Mind Candy team, Moo Yu. &quot;I was part of the launch of Applifier, a cross promotion network for indies on Facebook, and had a great experience there. I think that Best of British could be a similar force in the mobile gaming space&quot;. The idea with the jam is for each studio to create one or two small mini-games, which can then all be strung together into a sort of WarioWare collection. It will then be released on iOS platforms as a free-to-play title. Gamejams tend to have a theme to guide development, and with this one it&apos;s &apos;summer sports&apos;  &quot;Although it is no way connected with any other major sporting event that might be happen this summer in London,&quot; says Will Luton of Mobile Pie. From here, BoB is planning a series of speed dating events in which members meet journalists, investors and companies offering work for hire, so that new contacts can be spawned. &quot;There&apos;s no hierarchy and no agenda,&quot; says Luton. &quot;It&apos;s just a good way to do some networking - a lot of these developers work from home; you have people like Andrew Smith at Spilt Milk who works in a shed in his parent&apos;s garden; BoB is a good way to meet up and have a bit of a bitch. You don&apos;t pay a subscription fee to be a member, it&apos;s free, and it serves a lot of functions that trade bodies like Tiga and Ukie don&apos;t&quot;. The Summer of Sports title will be ready for download very soon. You can check the Best of British Facebook page for updates.",

    "text": "The European commission needs to develop a proper and integrated strategy on nutrition backed by a significant increase in funding, according to a report backed by international organisations, companies and NGOs. The report on EU and nutrition development policy calls on the commission, the executive arm of the EU, to raise funds for nutrition from 418m to 1bn (800m) in its next budget, from 2014 to 2020. There are clear indications that strong majorities in the EU council of member states and the European parliament fully endorsed the report&apos;s recommendations, it says. The UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated that up to 1 billion people are undernourished. The 2008 Lancet series on maternal and child undernutrition showed that if undernutrition can be overcome  especially during the first 1,000 days  not only can lives be saved, but children can also grow up to realise their full potential. The Lancet said efforts to reduce child mortality and improve nutrition have been fragmented and dysfunctional. The World Bank has estimated the cost of tackling cases in the 36 countries that represent 90% of undernutrition for children under five at $11.8bn annually. Citing a common criticism of commission policy, the report called for a coherent strategy on how funds should be allocated across different priorities and geographic areas. &quot;This would address frequent criticism that the valuable contributions supported with EU funds could be a lot more cost effective if they were part of one master plan rather than result from different EU actors following their own partial strategies,&quot; the report said. Second, an EU strategy should explicitly include the private sector in public-private partnerships, academia and civil society, assigning roles and responsibilities to hold the different actors accountable for their respective contributions. Finally, the report said financial resources allocated to nutrition are too low (418m, about 3.5% of total development spending). The recommended increase to a minimum of 1bn would provide sufficient weight to the European commission&apos;s commitment to reducing malnutrition. The report noted the importance of giving full consideration to the positive or negative impacts of other EU policies on efforts to improve nutrition, such as trade, agriculture and agriculture subsidies, industrial and labour. The EU is seeking to harmonise its policies, so that policies such as its common agricultural policy (Cap) do not have an adverse impact on development. The commission&apos;s policy coherence for development cites food security as one of five priority areas and the report urged the commission to ensure that Cap in 2014-20 is &quot;supportive of developing countries&apos; nutrition interventions, through appropriate means such as impact assessments&quot;. The report said it is important to invest in strategies that can provide access to a healthy diet in ways that are environmentally sustainable, taking into account water use, biofuels, changing demographics and climate change. The main ways to promote good nutrition include breastfeeding, complementary feeding for infants after the age of six months, and improved hygiene practices. Other measures include increasing the intake of vitamins and minerals, and therapeutic feeding for malnourished children. As for the private sector, the report said tackling malnutrition is too big a challenge for governments, international organisations and civil society, hence the need for companies to play a role. The report cited several examples of public-private partnerships, including Enterprise Ethiopia. The project, which seeks to substantially increase chickpea production and promote nutritional and economic security, involves PepsiCo (the drinks and snacks giant), the PepsiCo foundation, the World Food Programme and USAid. The aim is to enable 10,000 Ethiopian farmers to realise a two-fold increase in chickpea yield through modern agricultural practices and irrigation techniques. The interest for PepsiCo is that chickpea-based products are part of the company&apos;s strategy to build a $30bn global nutrition business by 2020. Chickpeas are seen as an alternative to meat, particularly for adults. In calling for a big EU push on nutrition, the report said: &quot;The EU is already the world&apos;s largest donor  now is the time to show that it is also the most effective aid actor. In this context, nutrition is a significant opportunity for the EU to practically show its global leadership.&quot;",

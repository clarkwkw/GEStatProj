    "text": "We presented some edited highlights of Alok Jha&apos;s interview with science writer, broadcaster, doctor and academic Ben Goldacre in the show on 8 October. In today&apos;s Science Weekly Extra we bring you the full interview.  Goldacre&apos;s new book Bad Pharma is a forensic investigation into how the pharmaceutical industry  which invests millions in the high-stakes process of drug development and clinical trials  ensures its products reach the market.  Goldacre discusses the central thesis of Bad Pharma, that drug development and evidence-based medical research are not working for the benefit of patients and may even be endangering lives.  Goldacre also explains why he thinks there is a need for more transparency in the patient-doctor relationship and why science journals and regulatory authorities need to rethink the evidence threshold and seek full and open disclosure of both positive and negative drug trials.

    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view The grotesquely muscular &quot;human&quot;, Kratos, returns, armed with his usual array of razor-sharp blades to chop up hordes of semi-mythical monsters. Lurching between engagements in the game&apos;s near-constant combat, you&apos;ll get the odd simple lever-pulling or block-moving puzzle to create short breaks from killing. Using every button on the controller and relying on too many quick-time events (where you press buttons as they flash up on screen in order to eviscerate some tower block-sized beast), God of War: Ascension is very highly polished, even if its combat-only mantra sometimes feels more exhausting than invigorating. The new dodge and grab moves spice things up a little, and multiplayer is surprisingly great, bringing new rules and a genuinely interesting twist to the by now routine demigod-dicing action. This may be more of the same, but it looks and feels so good you can&apos;t help liking it.",

    "text": "Here is the second and final part of our jaunt through the year&apos;s (possibly) overlooked gems. We&apos;ve taken in indie experiments as well as major sports titles and robot battle sims, all of them deserving of your attention, but maybe not as &apos;vocal&apos; about it as the likes of Dishonored and Xcom. So yes, come this way if you&apos;re looking for a few extra Christmas treats that probably won&apos;t break the bank in these trying times.  Asura&apos;s Wrath (PS3, Xbox 360)            Okay, so it&apos;s essentially a series of quick-time events sellotaped together and stuck haphazardly onto a needlessly complicated story about a vengeful demigod, but Capcom&apos;s anime brawler is also an idiosyncratic masterpiece. Developed by CyberConnect2, the team behind the .hack RPGs, it is kind of a third-person beat-&apos;em-up, with a rage meter that just grows and grows until the titular hero is able to punch an entire planet. Not so much a game as an interactive lesson in adolescent hyperbole. You may not like it, but you will only stop saying &apos;I can&apos;t believe they did that&apos;, after the end credits roll.  Joe Danger 2: The Movie (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)            The motorbike stunt game that isn&apos;t Trials returned this year with a beautiful, joyous and feature-packed sequel. This time, players have to negotiate a series of devious and testing circuits designed to resemble Hollywood movie sets as our hero gets to grips with his new role as a stuntman. Part driving sim, part platformer, Joe Danger 2 is a big primary-coloured fun bomb, with wonderful controls, loads of ideas and a difficulty curve that builds toward a ramp of considerable challenge. Just clamber aboard your unicycle and sway this way. Okami HD (PS3)            Didn&apos;t play Okami on its original PlayStation 2 release? Later failed to play it again when the Wii version arrived two years later? Okay, I&apos;m going to try not to judge you, but it will be really difficult (Pause, deep breath) Okami is a mature, expressive and visually arresting adventure written by Capcom&apos;s doomed Clover Studio, the creators of Viewtiful Joe. This PS3 update brings added depth and texture to the lush watercolour visuals, and gently tweaks the smooth gameplay with its seamless transitions between combat, exploration and puzzling. Just just play it. Unfinished Swan (PS3)            This year, thatgamecompany&apos;s wonderful Journey wasn&apos;t the only avant garde experience seeking to challenge a player&apos;s perception of virtual environments. Giant Sparrow, another set of USC graduates based in Santa Monica produced the equally sublime, obtuse but rewarding Unfinished Swan, a game about expiring the unknown  mostly by conjuring it into existence through paint splats and puzzle mechanics. Like Journey, too, it is a short experience, two or three hours long, following an odd character on a mysterious quest of discovery - this time the prize is a swan that has escaped from an unfinished painting. But what you discover about game design is much more telling and valuable.  Darksiders II (PC, PS3, Wii U, Xbox 360)            First of all, this game puts you into the role of Death. DEATH! The hardest of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. That should be enough. But it is also a thrilling and well-constructed action RPG that borrows hefty chunks of Zelda and Diablo, but manages to craft its own experience amid the familiar weapons upgrades, treasure maps and dungeon romps. Overlooked by many amid this year&apos;s avalanche of fantasy-themed titles, this hack-n-slasher should be sought out by all underworld death merchants. Chivalry: Medievel Warfare (PC)            Developed by the fledgling Torn Banner studios, this first-person multiplayer medieval combat game was seemingly written for anyone who&apos;s ever watched John Boorman&apos;s Excalibur (a bit early historically, but never mind), and wanted a piece of that sword-clanging, limb slicing action. Players can take part as one of four classes then upgrade their weapons for more battlefield bludgeoning power. It&apos;s bloody, but also tactical and it makes a change from earnest modern military shooters. Rayman Jungle Run (iOS)            Ubisoft hasn&apos;t scrimped on Rayman titles recently, so you may well have missed this superlative touchscreen interpretation of the characters&apos;s standard 2D platforming recipe. Re-thought as an endless runner and utilising a brilliant one-touch control mechanic, the game packs in all the features we expect from a Rayman title including wall jumps, obstacles and hovering sequences, all within densely realised jungle environments.  Bad Hotel (iOS)            The winner in the Best Game category at this year&apos;s Scottish Baftas, Bad Hotel is a joyous combination of procedural music toy and tower defence battler. Your role as a budding hotel proprietor is to build the most desirable stopover possible, while fending off the animal attackers sent by a local rival. Adding new rooms modifies the soundtrack so you&apos;re constructing new tunes as well as business. Hectic and bewildering at times, it&apos;s a truly eccentric treat. Transformers: Fall of Cybertron (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)            Should grown men and women really play a Transformers game? Yes, if it&apos;s Fall of Cybertron, sequel to the fan favourite, War for Cybertron. Set amid the decaying urban detritus of their wrecked robot planet, the game has the autobots and decepticons indulging in their final home fixture before jetting off across the galaxy. Chunky third-person shooting action and some steel-plated campaign missions make this a solid outing, offering much more than  ugh  an interactive Michael Bay movie. NBA 2K13 (PC, PS3, Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360)            While EA has continually dropped the (basket)ball with its attempts to revive NBA Live, 2K Games has just been quietly getting on with publishing the thrillingly authentic NBA 2K series. 2K13 boosts the realism with refreshed animations and a deep new control scheme as well as classy commentary, cool signature moves and a large roster that takes in some of the sport&apos;s historic greats. Oh and there&apos;s lots of Jay Z (he is executive producer on the title) if you like that sort of thing.",

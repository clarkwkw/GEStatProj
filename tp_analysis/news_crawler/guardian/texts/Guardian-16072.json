    "headline": "Letter: Barrie Dobson helped bring high-quality cinema to York", 
    "text": "Alongside his distinguished career as a medieval historian, Barrie Dobson made a great contribution to cinema in York. When he joined the university in 1964 he had already been secretary of the film society at St Andrews. At York he served in that capacity for three seasons, at a time when the British Film Institute was seeking to develop regional centres of exhibition. Barrie initiated negotiations with the BFI, and the York film theatre opened in the university&apos;s central hall in October 1968 with a screening of the Danish film The Red Mantle, with its director, Gabriel Axel, present. Barrie served as chair of YFT until 1973, and the organisation that he founded continued to bring high-quality cinema to York, both on campus and in the city, until a commercial arts cinema arrived in the 1990s.",

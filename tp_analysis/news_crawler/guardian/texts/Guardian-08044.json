    "text": "Games that emerge from development hell are rarely dull. You get the true monstrosities  Duke Nukem Forever, Daikatana, Too Human  but you also get those flawed gems such as Spore, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Gran Turismo 5, games that speak of greatness while still baring the scars of mid-cycle calamities and vast engine rebuilds. Then there the unqualified success stories, titles such as Half Life 2 and Resident Evil 4, that manage to overcome nightmarishly protracted and complex back stories to achieve greatness.  Somewhere toward that end of the spectrum is Sleeping Dogs, the unexpected summer hit that&apos;s keeping Darksiders 2 from the top of the charts. This engaging thriller started out two years ago as Black Lotus, a mature open-world adventure set in Hong Kong and heavily influenced by the city&apos;s action movie directors: Ringo Lam, Johnnie To, John Woo. It was an ambitious project for United Front Games, a Vancouver studio that had been formed only a couple of months before by ex-staff from nearby publishers such as EA and Rockstar. But it was a dark, brutal and interesting concept. It had promise. And then came Activision, a tarnished license and, eventually, the threat of cancellation.  So how did UFG create such a solid and entertaining gangland romp, despite the chaotic development process? We spoke to the game&apos;s senior producer, Jeff O&apos;Connell to find out.So, how did Black Lotus become True Crime: Hong Kong? What happened?The first meetings around this game were in the fall of 2007. It was a very small crew at that point; there were about 10 of us in a tiny little office. We met with Activision and back then, they knew they wanted to get back into the urban open-world genre; they had a prototype on the go, but they asked us to come up with a concept  which we did. And amazingly, that concept was very similar to the game we ended up releasing.  But what happened was, they liked the idea, but at the time they wanted to push it more toward the flavour of True Crime  and obviously they attached the brand to it. We wanted the tone to be more like an HBO cop show.  But, I suppose Activision had enjoyed some success with True Crime, which was much more of a Hollywood-style treatment of the genre. Obviously, while those games were enjoyed by a lot of people, we felt our concept was different. Of course, they were both about cops, but we thought that times had changed and that people wanted something else; it felt like the opportunity was there to make a more mature title.  Certainly TV was going in that direction at the time.Absolutely. Look at the cop shows that have been successful  The Wire, The Shield  every character is ambiguous. Look at the latest James Bond movies, and the way Daniel Craig plays the character  is he really a good guy? He&apos;s sort of a mercenary. That to us was really interesting. And we were fortunate enough in having an actor like Will Yun Lee who could pull off that sort of performance.  But you made changes to the feel of the game to fit with True Crime  and then in February 2011, the game was effectively canned. How did that go down internally? Did you think it was all over?It was a terrible time really. Activision were very respectful in how they went about informing us of the decision; they let go hundreds of their employees that same day, they cancelled Guitar Hero  you could tell that it wasn&apos;t an easy decision to make. But it was rough times for us, we had to downsize our team within a couple of weeks, and you begin to question a lot of things  we&apos;d been working on the game for three and a half years at that point and you pour your heart and soul into it. But within a couple of weeks we heard that Square had played the game and were interested in it and they wanted to speak to us  it was a ray of hope. We talked to them on the phone, they came to Vancouver and met with us. Right away it felt like a very different relationship to the one we had with Activision. Their producers really were old-skool gamers; they&apos;d been working in games since the eighties, as had many staff in our studio. So right away there was a personal connection and they got what we wanted to do with the game. And throughout the development we benefitted form their experience working on titles like Just Cause 2. We just clicked.      Sleeping Dogs    So they really understood the dynamics of open-world game design?Yes. They didn&apos;t feel there was any need to make everything obvious right away; an open-world game is one that unfolds over 30 hours  you don&apos;t have to set it all up in the first sixty minutes, you don&apos;t have to have a singular motivation  the characters can develop. I think the biggest change was in the overall tone of the story, the presentation of the game flow, how the game ramps up. We start with action, certainly, but we hold your hand a little to get you into the mechanics  there are a lot of mechanics! Previously, we were pushed to go for high octane action upfront which we think hurts the game, because it&apos;s annoying when that&apos;s taken away from you.  And it seems like you were able to make changes to the design right through until the end?Yeah, open-world development is challenging and there were things even late in development, with a few weeks to go, that we looked at and said, &quot;We need to up that system!&quot; Things come together very late  it&apos;s like a giant jigsaw puzzle and you kind of only see it in its entirety with a few weeks to go.  So what were some of the key gameplay changes you made to the game, after its reformation as Sleeping Dogs?Well, very late, we looked at the UI of the upgrade system: how it was laid out, how you were made aware of upgrades, how you used the upgrades menu, how you discovered what you did and didn&apos;t have, encouraging you to spend points and accompanying that process with appropriate UI and audio moments. That sort of stuff was really overhauled late in production, not because were unhappy with it, but because it was a big part of the game and we felt it was under-realised. The other thing was the lock boxes hidden around the world. Originally, most had cash in them, not weapons or clothes, so there was less surprise and satisfaction  it was a minor change but it altered the way people played the game.  Developing a good upgrade UI and a decent loot system are RPG elements  it&apos;s interesting those should have been altered after the creator of Final Fantasy became your publisher!(Laughs) Yes, that&apos;s true! I think that&apos;s the great thing about working with Square. Producer Chris Dillon and Alastair Cornish, the design lead  they really focused on the little things, the game systems  they were constantly playing and given us feedback. Alastair spent a lot of time talking to our design director, Mike Skupa, who&apos;s ex-Rockstar and lead designer on Bully.  It&apos;s interesting as an aside  everyone says the combat system is like Batman, but if you think back to Bully that was the genesis of this kind of open-world combat. That&apos;s really where the impetus came from. But the loot system was Mike and Alistair talking and finding ways to make the feedback loop more obvious and compelling to the player, more enticing, more fun. And if we were to do a sequel, which we&apos;d like to do, we&apos;ll push that RPG aspect of the game even further.  It&apos;s definitely the strength of the game systems, the mechanics of the game, that people are responding too, isn&apos;t it?Open-world games have a lot of stuff in them  in Sleeping Dogs, between the main missions and all the collectibles and everything else, there are around 300 things to do; there are hours of cut-scenes and it&apos;s a big game world. We&apos;ve got all these mechanics that we spent time on. As a developer, you can get lost in all that stuff and just put it out there. But working with Square and having the extra time allowed us to look at the feedback loops and say, there&apos;s an opportunity that&apos;s under realised here  we have the basics, but it&apos;s not as good as it could be. I think the reason the systems are there in the first place is that Mike, our design director, spent a lot of time looking at social and mobile gaming and saw that the feedback loop is really what makes those games entertaining and playable  it&apos;s even the same with titles like Starcraft and Diablo. And looking to the future, with the new consoles coming, developers really need to be thinking about the feedback loop  especially for open-world games. That&apos;s where the addiction element comes in  it&apos;s not just about twitch anymore, it seems.      Sleeping Dogs    So is there a secret to building compelling feedback loops within action adventure game designs?The big picture is, if you break down the core mechanics - fighting, shooting, driving  we brought in expert designers and gameplay engineers who had worked on those areas. We had Mike from Bully  and a lot of the other engineers also worked on that game. Our driving designer was from Need For Speed; that&apos;s where the pick-up-and-play driving and the car tuning came from. And for shooting we have guys from Max Payne, Scarface we really tried to assemble a team that could deliver best-in-class mechanics. We were fortunate that the personalities clicked - if that hadn&apos;t happened we would have been in trouble!  I&apos;d love to say there&apos;s a secret recipe, but these guys just worked their butts off. I think they did that because, when the game was cancelled, they took it personally  we&apos;d never had a project axed before. We knew the game was good  these guys felt they had to prove themselves to their peers in the industry, to their families... and they went the extra mile.  The game is very big on environmental combat moves  being able to smash opponents into walls and other scenic objects. That could have been a gimmick, but here it really seems to ground you and connect you with the surroundings.That was something we knew would be critical for us. We had a movie clip that provided the goal of our fighting mechanic  it was from a Tony Jaa movie called the Protector. The lead character is fighting his way up a circular staircase around the parameter of a large room, and it&apos;s all done in one shot so it feels like an action game. But the point is, in this sequence, he uses everything  railings, vases, sinks, televisions  any stuff in the environment. And when we started to go deeper and really look at Hong Kong cinema, Jet Li does the same thing, so does Jackie Chan  look at Police Story, that fight in the mall, he&apos;s using clothing rails, he&apos;s using escalators. It&apos;s just such a signature of Hong Kong action cinema, we felt we had to do it. And again if a sequel happens, I&apos;d love to push that ever further.  Ultimately, what has Sleeping Dogs taught you about game development?We all learned that the industry has changed. When we started, a couple of months into UFG&apos;s operation, the iPhone came out, and later the iPad, and Facebook had risen in prominence. How gamers entertain themselves  that whole model has changed. It forces publishers to be more careful with how they develop games and spend their money. Developers of triple A titles have to be on their A game all the time  every single member of the team needs to realise what&apos;s at stake. There are no free launches any more  if there ever were.  Do you think, as we enter the next console generation that it&apos;s going to become almost impossible for publishers to bet on original IPs from small studios? The development costs are going to rise enormously.There aren&apos;t as many opportunities. And for studios who do get the opportunity, there&apos;s more pressure than there ever has been. The end of original IP would be incredibly depressing, but look at Watch Dogs, that&apos;s an exciting new property  it has captured the imagination of gamers. Every time there&apos;s a new generation of consoles the processing power opens up new opportunities for gameplay. I think we&apos;ll see new franchises spawn, some designer somewhere will be inspired in a new way. And will we see a Sleeping Dogs 2 on the next-gen hardware?There has been such a great response to the game. We feel like there are more stories to tell and we think from a mechanics point of view the next generation consoles present possibilities that will work really well for us. We&apos;re optimistic, that&apos;s for certain.",

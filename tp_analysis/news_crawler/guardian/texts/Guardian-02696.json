    "text": "Having traded on its authentically unsettling early efforts for too long, survival horror series Silent Hill is hungry for a Resident Evil 4-style reinvention. With Downpour what it gets instead is a snackish retread of the series&apos; emblematic touches  slickfetish monsters, blood-red corridors and ghostly puzzles  presented without any of the oldmenace. At its best, Silent Hill works throughpsychology rather than bluntforce, with nightmare geographyand traumatised narratorscreating a Lynchian atmosphere of meaningful incoherence. Downpour aims for the same, with escaped convict Murphy Pendleton battling repressed guilt as much as the town&apos;s fog-shrouded creatures, but the gaps in logic come off as clumsy rather than compelling, a problem amplified by some serious technical shortcomings (leaden combat, an occasionally disastrousframe rate). In the end, Downpour is like one of Silent Hill&apos;s own wretched heroes  trapped by the past and doomed to repeat it.",

    "text": "   Michael Mwango, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    In terms of sustainable development in our programmes at Edusport Foundation, we look at it from a different viewpoint. As an organisation using sport to educate young people in Zambia, we believe in developing leaders for social change. At the heart of this change, we see gender issues and therefore develop both females and males in leadership positions to take on the responsibility of themselves and others around them. By ensuring equal participation in our African set-up, we challenge the past, which has given only male folk exposure to many leadership roles, especially when it came to sport and play. Working with males and females to promote the message of quality, we want to ensure that girls have access to education and, through sport, create vibrant and well-informed young people who are able to face challenging situations. By integrating youths in established institutions or organisations and communities, they gain the respect of elders who are from a different and often conflicting cultural understanding of women today. Using sport to discourage practices that hinder equal participation in sport and play by both boys and girls, we are building a future which promotes and enhances healthy lifestyles that provide support for development at all levels. Leaders in sport can become leaders, lobbyers and advocates for change and, through sport, gain the support of local authorities to allocate more resources to youth-led programmes. In Zambia we are promoting the positive information flow of important social messages which will impact not only all levels of development, but also all levels of society.",

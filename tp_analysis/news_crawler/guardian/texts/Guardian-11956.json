    "text": "&quot;What in the world is a historian doing at an internet institute?&quot; It&apos;s a question I&apos;ve been asked many times  by colleagues, students and friends  and one that I&apos;ve asked myself more than once too. For the past four years, I have been working at a research centre dedicated to understanding the societal implications of the internet. The research my colleagues are engaged in is rooted in the here and now, the very recent past, and often the future. I&apos;m feel very lucky, but as this recent blog post by Sarah Werner (@wynkenhimself) suggests, sometimes you have to make your own luck and keep an open mind as you develop your academic career. How did I get here? After finishing my doctorate, I did what many humanities PhDs do and picked up some teaching work while applying for jobs. I was asked to give a talk to incoming graduate students, imparting my top 10 tips on getting through the PhD process, and that got me thinking about how much the process had changed since I started my own doctoral studies. A lot of those changes were related to the seeming ubiquity of digital technology. When I started my doctorate, you still had to fill out book requests at the Bodleian Library on slips of paper, and most of my peers took notes at lectures and seminars using a notebook  the sort you write in with a pen. By the time I finished, all my notes were made on a computer, and I would order my books online from the comfort of my home in between reading journal articles online and browsing digital archives. So when I saw a vacancy for a researcher to probe the impact of digitised scholarly resources on the humanities, I was compelled to find out more. It turned out to be a huge turning point in my academic career. I carried on teaching history part-time for the first six months I spent at the Oxford Internet Institute, thinking that this research project would be an interesting and valuable diversion from my &apos;real&apos; research interests. Six months on, I was hooked. The pace of research is necessarily very fast, the work is much more collaborative, and I enjoy being at the cutting edge of developments in research and technology, if only as an observer. I&apos;m enormously lucky to have happened upon a fascinating research area just as it was emerging into the mainstream and it helps that the digital humanities are full of traditional humanities scholars who&apos;ve made the same leap. I often find myself discussing my &apos;old&apos; research interests alongside the new, and making connections between them. My first steps on the academic ladder have taken me in a quite different direction than I expected, but then again, academic life itself has been reinvented in the digital age, providing opportunities for academics in every discipline. New tools and technologies have opened up new research areas and methods, with more room for interdisciplinarity. In turn, these new methods and sources of data require new ethical, legal, institutional and social frameworks, and efforts to think through some of these issues have encouraged collaboration and communication across disciplinary boundaries, revealing shared areas of interest and expertise. There are new means of connecting with scholars and thinkers both inside and outside academia (the Twitter hashtag #ECRchat for starters) leading to non-traditional but powerful impacts. If this all sounds a touch utopian, I should say that, of course, not all of these changes have been positive. But the positives brought about by this digital transformation over the past decade have, in my view, outweighed the negatives, and particularly apply to early career academics. Access to online resources, networks and social media have the potential to transform the PhD process, allowing researchers to reach out and participate in academic networks more often, more easily and more dynamically than ever before. Access to digital resources can transform the research process, and creative use of social media allows graduate students to build up their academic reputation much sooner in their career. In the current financial climate, universities and research councils are feeling the pinch, and competition for jobs and research funding has never been keener. With the array of new technologies at our fingertips, it is more important than ever to keep an open mind about the path ahead, and to take advantage of every opportunity.

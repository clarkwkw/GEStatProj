    "text": "While the recently released Doctor Who: Worlds in Time online multiplayer game proved that the diminutive browser window can play host to ambitious, glossy and sprawling adventures, it is on the fringes of the games developmentscene that the most exciting - and sometimes challenging-pieces of browser entertainment lurk. Dys4ia, for example, is a brief autobiographical account of its creator&apos;s experience of undergoing hormone replacement therapy. It offers a touching and witty insight into an experience many may never even consider in detail. Something of an abstract parody of video game conventions, Dys4ia does much to prove the power of games to communicate complex concepts through playful interactions. If, however, pondering such personal perspectives isn&apos;t quite what you&apos;re looking for, new release Roar Rampage might be just the ticket. This slick title gives you control of a giant dinosaur, tasked with smashing down cities with its claws, and is immense fun. Despite a low-brow theme, it&apos;s a remarkably elegant distraction with a strong flavour of video gaming&apos;s past. And if that&apos;s not quite refined enough, Dude, Where&apos;s My Planet? may offer a happy middle ground. A straightforwardand beautifully illustrated game based on toying with the gravitational pull of clusters of globes, it proves that with quality execution even the most rudimentary concepts can be compelling.",

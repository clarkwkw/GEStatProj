    "text": "Thousands of pupils excluded from state schools are being deprived of the opportunity to gain qualifications that would help them build a future, according to children&apos;s campaigners. Permanent exclusion has always been the ultimate sanction for headteachers, subject to a final appeals process. Last year, there were 5,080 permanent exclusions from state schools. Since September, however, new legislation has made it much harder for parents and carers of excluded children to reverse a school&apos;s decision or get it removed from a child&apos;s records. Many schools are reluctant to offer a place to a child who has been excluded from a nearby school as they have a duty to protect pupils from others who may be disruptive. Most excluded children are sent to local-authority-run Pupil Referral Units (PRU), where places cost upwards of 16,000 a year, compared with around 4,500 for a place at a mainstream school. In spite of the high cost, PRU pupils are only able to take a limited range of courses. The units provide a limited careers service and no sixth-form facilities. Despite supportive teachers, bad behaviour is often the norm and vulnerable children are free to mix with other disruptive pupils. A study by the independent thinktank, Demos, found that only 1% of excluded children received the equivalent of five A* to C grades at GCSE level, compared with 70% of pupils who remained in school. According to the Department of Education, pupils with special educational needs are around nine times more likely to be excluded permanently. Children who are eligible for free school meals are almost four times more likely. Scout Pedley, 15, was expelled last month from Swakeleys School, Uxbridge, for persistent breaches of the school behaviour code, which included, she says, wearing non-regulation trousers, swearing at a teacher and banging a school door violently. She had been on track to get 13 GCSEs and was in the top 20% of her year group. Her appeal has been rejected and she is now at a Pupil Referral Unit. This means that, just months before sitting her GCSEs, she has run into a major roadblock. &quot;I am taking Maths, English  trying to get a science  ICT, art and that&apos;s it. It&apos;s gone from 13 GCSEs to four or five. I have a lot more free time and they don&apos;t give out homework. I still want to be an accountant. It&apos;s just going to be harder.&quot; Sarah Hannett, the director of the City University/Matrix School Exclusion Project, which provides free legal representation to parents of children who have been excluded, says: &quot;It&apos;s a scandal. A disproportionate number of excluded pupils have special needs, or are in care. Plus, kids simply can&apos;t get a new place that gives them full access to the curriculum.&quot; Headteacher at Swakeleys, Sue Pryor, said the school &quot;never wants to exclude students in year 11 and always tries to make alternative arrangements for them to complete their GCSEs&quot;. She said: &quot;An independent appeal considered all the evidence and took into account that Scout was in year 11. They unanimously upheld the decision to exclude her on the grounds that to allow her to return to the school would seriously undermine authority and the general climate of discipline in the school.&quot; Scout says she &quot;wasn&apos;t an angel&quot; but says &quot;doesn&apos;t deserve to be put in this situation&quot;. Her mother, Mandie, says: &quot;She just wants to go back to school, finish her exams and leave at end of year 11, go to college and carry on. Obviously, that&apos;s been blown out of the window. You only get one shot at it.&quot;  This article was amended on 13 December to include a statement from the headteacher of Swakeleys School, Uxbridge.",

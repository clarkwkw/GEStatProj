Windows watcher Paul Thurrott revealed recently that Microsoft is planning an Xbox event for May 21st, and we understand this date is accurate. This is the tentative date for a next-generation Xbox announcement, but Microsoft had originally planned an April 24th event.  BioShock Infinite VP of development Rod Fergusson leaving Irrational Games | Polygon  Rod Fergusson, the former Gears of War producer who joined Irrational Games to help wrap up BioShock Infinite, is in the process of leaving the company, Fergusson confirmed to Polygon today. Fergusson says that while he is still at the company he is in the process of working through the transition and hasn&apos;t yet determined where he will go next. &quot;During my departure from Epic, I learned that Irrational was in need of a &apos;closer&apos; to help finish BioShock Infinite,&quot; he wrote to Polygon. &quot;I&apos;ve been striving for better storytelling in the games I&apos;ve worked on and I saw this as a great opportunity to learn from Ken and his team on how to build a truly story-driven game. &quot;I am very proud of the work that I did and of the team and what they were able to accomplish on Infinite. Now with the game shipped successfully, I&apos;ve done what I set out to do here and now I&apos;m looking forward to the next chapter in my life and career.&quot;  Mobile &quot;just too scary&quot; for indies, says Spelunky dev | GamesIndustry International Derek Yu talking about smartphone game development:  &quot;I think it&apos;s tough because that market does have so many games that are there to be cheap entertainment and make a lot of money,&quot; Yu said. &quot;That&apos;s just a difficult place to be for a developer who wants to make essentially a non-mobile style game for a mobile platform. It&apos;s just kind of intimidating. It&apos;s a very finicky business, too, in terms of what succeeds and what doesn&apos;t. For a lot of developers, putting games on iOS and mobile feels like a lottery, and that&apos;s a real unstable feeling that&apos;s hard for developers.&quot;  Ouya responds to negative reviews | GamesIndustry International When Android console manufacturer Ouya started sending out early models of the machine, the result was a smattering of negative reviews. Now the company has come out to defend its intriguing platform:  &quot;We will be making Ouya review units available in early to mid-May so that you are able to review the more complete consumer experience and prepare your coverage in time for the June 4th retail launch,&quot; a representative said. &quot;To clarify for you--Ouya has sent no review units out to press. Any reviews you have seen online are a result from individuals who received early backer units from supporting our Kickstarter.&quot;  Street Fighter TV series takes to Kickstarter | MCV Ben Parfitt:  A new Kickstarter campaign has been launched that hopes to create a real-life Street Fighter themed TV series. Unlike the &apos;90s movie, however, this looks like it might actually be good. It&apos;s being made by the creators of web video hit Street Fighter: Legacy (which can be seen below).

It&apos;s called Street Fighter: Assassin&apos;s Fist and is being co-written and directed by British actor and martial artist Joey Ansah, whose has starred in the likes of The Bourne Ultimatum and Snow White and the Huntsman.

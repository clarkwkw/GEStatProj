    "text": "Scarygirl, the creation of Australian artist Nathan Jurevicius, has, for more than a decade now, been the subject of comics, toys and similar geek-baiting artefacts. This 2D platforming affair is her console gaming debut. The game Jurevicius has made is certainly beautiful. A superb example of the cheerful, pigtailed-horror aesthetic that presents otherwise nightmarish worlds as cuddly-cute and kookily spooky, Scarygirl is a delight for the eyes. Sadly it lacks similar magic in the gameplay. The mechanics are functional and polished, but the design and layout of the many levels feel very familiar, and a little short of the creative boldness so apparent in the visuals. Compared to the standards set by genre stalwarts such as Super Mario, Scarygirl falls flat, but will prove a worthy distraction for anyone smitten by sugar-coated horror.",

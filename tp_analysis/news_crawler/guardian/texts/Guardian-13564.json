    "text": "Aren&apos;t art schools weird nowadays? I can&apos;t help but compare and contrast. Our art school in the early 60s was a jolly establishment, with classrooms, studios, canteen, and Sid&apos;s cafe round the corner for tea, toast and jam. You did your painting, life classes, lithography, textiles, and very little writing. But last week Olga, an artist herself, took Fielding and me to an exhibition at Central St Martins in London. We couldn&apos;t make head nor tail of it. Whatever is a &quot;design probe&quot;? Apparently, the staff do them, and this was an exhibition of their work. But there wasn&apos;t much work on display. Only one bit each. The rest was mini-samples of work in glass-topped boxes, with yards of explanation. This was the &quot;research&quot;, that the poor teachers are doing to earn funding for their courses. Or there will be no courses. However do they find time to teach? Good job Fielding was there, or I might have blamed myself for being intolerant and not giving contemporary art and its language a chance. But we were both flummoxed. And he has taught English for 30 years and is adept at translating bollocks. How do you use &quot;fieldwork methods of observation and walking to compile an inventory which explore[s] the act of naming of local elements through oral inscription&quot;? We asked Olga to translate. &quot;It means &apos;going for a walk and taking notes&apos;,&quot; said she briskly. But Fielding and I soon glazed over, trying to work the rest of it out, and needed a sit-down and drink. It was light years from Sid&apos;s cafe. You couldn&apos;t just have a quick, student-price tea and toast. It was brownies and cappuccinos with poncy, swirly patterns in the foam, with waiter service, costing an arm and a leg, and lukewarm after all the diddling about. But at the station on his way home Fielding spotted a tiger made of recycled squashed plastic milk bottles and tin cans, with no explanatory essay. Phew. Only a plain request for Save the Tiger donations. He loved it. We can embrace the present, within reason.",

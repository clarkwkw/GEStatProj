    "text": "Twitter has relaunched its website and mobile apps to give users the opportunity to showcase their own photos. In what appears to be a bid to take on Facebook, users&apos; new-look Twitter profiles will have more visual interest, with their photo stream now shown on their page. The stream will also appear below their most recent tweets. Users&apos; profile pictures will move from being a small icon at top left to a large header photo at the top of the Twitter stream. The move is in line with the company&apos;s plan to make the website more of a destination page. Facebook enlarged the display size of its images last year as part of a major overhaul that included the introduction of a timeline, streaming users&apos; posts from the day they joined. Twitter said its move was designed to &quot;make your presence on Twitter more meaningful&quot;. The new look will apply to Twitter&apos;s website, its iPhone and Android apps and its new iPad app.",

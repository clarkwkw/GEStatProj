D300s, 600 mm lens, ISO 1000, 1/1600 sec, f/9    Question: This Ethiopian mystery bird is unusual amongst its relatives because of one of the female&apos;s uncharacteristic behaviours. What behaviour is this? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Can you identify this bird&apos;s sex?  Response: This is an adult female spectacled weaver, Ploceus ocularis. The weavers are Old World birds that are placed into Ploceidae -- this family also includes the queleas and widowbirds.  Spectacled weavers are common in woodlands, disturbed forest and forest edge and in gardens throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. This species is not found in either rainforest or in arid regions.  The spectacled weaver is omnivorous, although it takes mostly fruits and seeds. This species has been observed hawking flying insects, foraging on the ground and gleaning insects in tree foliage.  Spectacled weavers are monogamous and territorial and appear to form long-term pair bonds. The nest is attached -- with knots -- to the tip of tree branch or creeper, and is a bottle shape, consisting of a woven nest chamber with an unusually long (for this family) entrance tunnel. Unusually amongst ploceids, the female may help the male construct the nest. Both parents incubate and tend to the chicks.  Both sexes have bright yellow upperparts with an olive-yellow back, black &quot;spectacles&quot; around its pale eyes, a thin, pointed beak that is dark brown or black, and dark brown or black legs and feet. The underparts are bright yellow. Adult males have a black throat. The female of this species can be distinguished from females of other weaverbird species by the dark beak -- female weavers of most other species have a horn-coloured bill. Although often mistaken for the female golden weaver, the spectacled weaver&apos;s thinner bill is diagnostic.

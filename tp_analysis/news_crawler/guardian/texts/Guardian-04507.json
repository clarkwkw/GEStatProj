    "text": "Hmmm, I&apos;m not finding this one easy, to be honest. They may have added a few scoops and ridges to this latest generation of Vauxhall&apos;s compact MPV, and given it headlights that look from the frontlike a pair of boomerangs. Butit&apos;s still a Zafira, one of the dullest vehicles on the road. AZzzzzzzzzafira, I sometimes call it. I happen to mention on Twitter that I&apos;m struggling to attain my usual lofty pinnacles of insightful motoring journalism, looking for inspiration. &quot;I know from experience it&apos;s a s**t car&quot;, says @philippapotts. She tells me about some handbrake problems she&apos;s had, and that it&apos;s dull to drive. She&apos;s talking about the previous generation Zafira (duller still), so it would be unfair to take Philippa&apos;s comments on board. One of my so-called rivals, from another so-called newspaper, says his nephew was sick in the one he tested. Then @SarahMillican75 sends me a tweet: &quot;Does it smell nice? Is there somewhere you can keep an emergency tampon? Can I overtake arseholes without worrying? There,&quot; she writes, indicating the direction a motoring report should take. Hang on @SarahMillican75, the Sarah Millican, off the telly! She&apos;s helping me with my review, how very excellent. I like her approach, too. From now on my reviews will take that format. Those are the questions I&apos;ll be asking. And answering. Here goes then. Odour. Right now this one smells of a new car, but one day it will smell of crisps, as all Zafiras do, because they&apos;re cars for families with lots of children. Crisps and sweets and maybe vomit. Like the man from the Independent&apos;s, hahaha. Tampon storage. Excellent. There all sorts of glove compartments, cup holders, sunglasses pockets (34 in total, Vauxhall says) etc which would do very well. Perhaps you&apos;re thinking of bulk buying? Not a problem. This is what the Zafira Tourer is excellent at  versatility in the back. Folding seats provide almost endless permutations depending on how many people/how much stuff you&apos;ve got to carry. So you could have five children back there. Or perhaps two premenstrual women, separated by a central console (it can be a testing time, I&apos;m told), with loads of room behind them for boxes of feminine hygiene products for when it all kicks off. Arsehole overtaking. Less impressive. It&apos;s probably a better drive than the previous model, but it&apos;s still a bit of a bus, to be honest  heavy, a little sluggish. But then it really is a bit of bus, so what do you expect? No one buys a Zafira for driving thrills. Or for any other kind of thrills. Unless you&apos;re into storage. Or being  and staying  behind arseholes. So to speak.

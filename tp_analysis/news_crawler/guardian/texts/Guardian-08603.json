    "text": "The debate over a third runway at Heathrow is not helped by Zac Goldsmith&apos;s failure (Cameron would pay a high price for a Heathrow U-turn, 8 September) to understand the importance of Heathrow as a hub airport for the whole of the United Kingdom. Telling those in the north how easy it is to take the train to Heathrow reveals he doesn&apos;t know how long it takes and how complex the journey actually is. Nor does he seem to grasp that the proposed high speed rail tracks will stop at Manchester and Leeds. His advocacy of a two-hub approach (Heathrow and Stansted), while worthy of further investigation, needs to bear in mind that the rest of the UK has to be connected to them. It is vital for rebalancing our economy and driving growth across the UK that our transport connectivity improves. Without it, the whole of the UK will pay the penalty, and our national carrier will increasingly lose business to hubs outside the UK such as Schiphol and Dubai. All the options now need full examination and we should welcome the review that is taking place. John ShipleyLiberal Democrat, House of Lords I am almost too ashamed to admit it, but I have to agree with Zac Goldsmith on something: a third runway at Heathrow would be a very expensive mistake. More sensible routing of planes and use of other airports would free up money for more essential infrastructure expenditure. If more money must be spent, yet again, on London, why not improve public transport access for the disabled, as the brilliant Sophie Christiansen suggests (London is horrendous, says triple gold medallist, 8 September)? Video conferencing and emails have surely diminished the need for business travel, and technological developments will undoubtedly reduce it further. Fancy a Tory MP suggesting the government has &quot;been seduced by vested interests&quot;. Whatever next?Bernie EvansLiverpool It is interesting that Zac Goldsmith, my MP, promotes himself as a &quot;green&quot; politician, yet belongs to a party increasingly committed to a third runway at Heathrow. Locally, the first thing his party did on taking power from the Liberal Democrats was to rescind one of the few local council green initiatives that made headlines nationally (a &quot;parking tax&quot; on less fuel-efficient cars), a move Mr Goldsmith subsequently defended. Without further action from him and others in positions of power, I fear a repeat of this episode with regard to Heathrow, and we will be left with a situation where we have identified another source of hot air, but done nothing about it, in an already warming world.Jane DoddsLondon In response to a question from me, the prime minister confirmed in parliament that he would abide by his party&apos;s manifesto committing to no third runway at Heathrow. There was no mention in this manifesto that the commitment was limited to the life of a parliament. However, later the same day, he announced that Howard Davies would be leading an inquiry into airport capacity that would investigate the case for a third runway at Heathrow, reporting after the next election. It&apos;s hardly surprising that most have interpreted this as a disingenuous manoeuvre to appease the powerful aviation lobby, get him past the next election and become the excuse to allow this environmental disaster to go ahead. Many are sceptical at the independence of the Davies inquiry, given that it is headed by a former director of the CBI, which has been a strong lobbyist for expanding Heathrow. Others question the judgment of a person who resigned his office because he allowed the university he led to have such close links to the Gaddafi regime. Whatever the prime minister&apos;s motives, let me warn him and others that if there is an attempt to ride roughshod over us and force this expansion through, they will be faced with the greatest environmental movement of resistance that this country has seen, using both the electoral process and if necessary an unprecedented wave of direct action to save our communities and our planet.John McDonnell MPLabour, Hayes and Harlington",

    "headline": "Self-funded PhD: research in practice", 
    "text": "   Photograph: supplied    I&apos;m a clinical lecturer teaching in an outreach clinic on the Isle of Dogs in London supervising the care of patients by undergraduate dental students. As a practicing clinician with 14 years&apos; experience and a keen interest in using evidence to inform decision-making, I began a DPhil in evidence-based healthcare at the University of Oxford in 2012. I am doing the DPhil on a part-time basis and so am currently able to fund myself through my day job and additional roles delivering educational courses and examining. I have never applied for funding, but if I am to develop an intervention that requires additional resources, this may have to change. The primary reason I&apos;m doing the DPhil is because I realise the difficulty of using research in decision-making. But if we want to produce the improvements in patient care that it promises, we need to work out how to help practitioners like myself to incorporate research more easily. I wanted to develop the skills to contribute towards this area and in so doing develop a research role in addition to the teaching one I currently hold. I am motivated to keep on going because I find the subject fascinating but I am also fortunate to have a very supportive supervisor. Raising your profile As someone who is remote from my research institution much of the time, I have been conscious of the need to use the internet to develop relationships with potential collaborators and research participants. Even before beginning the DPhil I was blogging principally for my students, but having begun the DPhil, I have started to use this to share my current thinking and, hopefully, nurture interest from others in this research area. I have become a more active user of my LinkedIn and Twitter accounts to raise the profile of the blog and to build links with others having a common interest. I also write regularly for the Evidence-Based Dentistry Journal and share my content on academic social networks such as Researchgate and Acadmia.edu. Awake at night The major issues that keep me awake at night are the problem of letting my DPhil work slip as my job responsibilities take over, and thinking of how I am going to develop my intervention. I don&apos;t know if there is a stigma to being unfunded but I am conscious that there are opportunities for researchers who have, say, NIHR or Wellcome Trust funding, that those of us without don&apos;t have.

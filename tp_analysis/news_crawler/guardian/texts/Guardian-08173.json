    "text": "Ross Anderson (A breach of anonymity, 29 August) rightly points out that it is impossible to guarantee the anonymity of publicly available patient data, quoting the Royal Society report Science as an Open Enterprise in evidence. It does not follow, however, that society should eschew the use of patient data for research purposes in ways that have already demonstrated considerable public benefit and which have the potential to yield much more. The Royal Society report stresses a proportionate approach to sharing, compiling and linking personal data that attempts to weigh public benefit against personal risk. It summarises strong governance mechanisms that can restrict access to data to researchers with a legitimate interest in the data, and who can be subject to penalties, including criminal sanctions, if they breach confidentiality. But we must be clear: such mechanisms can minimise but cannot remove the risk of breaching confidentiality. It is important that we are able to weigh the potential benefits of research against the potential harm of any unauthorised release of confidential data. Society routinely accepts risks where benefit is believed to outweigh them, as we do in accepting the benefits of road transport while attempting to minimise resulting fatalities. The upcoming consultation on changing the NHS constitution must be clear about what is proposed, including some of the troubling issues of security at the interface with private companies referred to by Ross Anderson, and it must be clear about risks and realistic about benefits.Geoffrey BoultonChair of the Royal Society&apos;s Science as an Open Enterprise working group ",

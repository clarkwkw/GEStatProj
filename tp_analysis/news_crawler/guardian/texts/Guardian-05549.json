    "text": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Motorola posts Q1 loss, despite rise in smartphones shipments &gt;&gt; ZDNet  Motorola&apos;s mobile device unit accounted for 71 percent of its total sales, marking a boom in its smartphone and tablet business. The company did not disclose how many tablets it sold during the quarter. Boosted by the Droid Razr and the Droid Razr Maxx, which has a larger battery life, the two smartphones practically carried the company through the first few months of the year, just as it did on the previous quarter.  Latest comScore figures show Motorola has just shy of 13% of the mobile OEM market share between December and March, though it dropped by 0.5%.   To be precise, Motorola&apos;s smartphone shipments grew by 1% year-on-year, while the worldwide smartphone market grew by 42%. And - no figures on tablet shipments? Usually the sign that the numbers were embarrassingly small. Google&apos;s embrace can&apos;t come too soon. (The takeover is awaiting Chinese approval, which is expected by the end of June.) Google offers big-data analytics &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  Google is selling some of its analytic guts as an online service, in an effort to compete with the likes of Amazon Web Services in the market for enterprise cloud computing.  In November, Google offered a limited number of developers access to some of its most powerful data analysis software, part of what Google uses to index the Internet, in a product called BigQuery. On Tuesday, Google announced that it was selling that software, which can scan terabytes of information in seconds, as a service to corporate customers.  Iran admits expanded cyberattacks, claims it&apos;s identified hackers &gt;&gt; Computerworld  The Iranian government acknowledged today that authorities have found evidence of recent cyberattacks against several agencies, according to reports by state-sponsored media outlets.  A week ago, the country&apos;s oil ministry confirmed that it and other facilities in the energy industry had been targeted by malware attacks.  Today, the Mehr News Agency said that Esmaeil Ahmadi-Moqaddam, Iran&apos;s national police chief, had claimed that his office has &quot;found clues about recent cyberattacks on a number of Iranian ministries and companies.&quot;  RIM&apos;s failed Hail Mary &gt;&gt; Dustin Curtis  You&apos;d think they would have spent the time to make sure they got it right, and that they would have focused on radically improving the user interface and experience to bring BlackBerry up to par with Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 7. It is almost impossible to comprehend, but they didn&apos;t do that.  Instead, they released something uninspired, uninteresting, and unfinished. That no one at RIM had the guts and authority to recognize the seriousness of their situation-the company is literally dying!-and say, &quot;Hey, maybe we should wait until BlackBerry 10 is awesome before we release it,&quot; is an ultimate demonstration of how RIM&apos;s culture will lead to its now inevitable demise. This is what happens when the sales people are in charge.   Only one word for that: ouch. Magnificent application of game theory, by a contestant on a game show &gt;&gt; bengoldacre It&apos;s a Prisoner&apos;s Dilemma game. But:   An interesting twist is permitted on this particular TV show, because the contestants get a chance to discuss strategy. Normally the play here seems simple: you try to persuade the other person that splitting is a good idea, and that you can be trusted. This time, one of the contestants plays a different and very clever approach, signalling a clear warning to his opponent. The fact that he works in charitable sector funding only makes it better.   And do watch to the very, very end of the clip. It is worth it. Not so fast: LG not ditching Windows Phone 7 &gt;&gt; Pocket-lint  LG is not, as rumoured, ditching Windows Phone 7 in favour of Android it seems with the electronics giant confirming as much to Pocket-lint.  &quot;None of it is true. Korea Herald is showing its speculative side again,&quot; a spokesman for the company in Korea exclusively told Pocket-lint before adding, &quot;We are still on board with Windows Phone, but right now, we&apos;re focusing on Android because that&apos;s where the demand is.&quot;   Translation: LG isn&apos;t giving up making Windows Phone devices. Then again, it isn&apos;t very interested in making them either. Tablet roll out begins for hundreds of health workers at Blackpool trust &gt;&gt; Guardian Government Computing  After a small pilot of BlackBerry Torch devices in the third quarter of last, where clinicians reported the devices being too small for dealing with the scheduling information, the trust began to take a second look for tablets with a larger, 7in screen.  While a range of devices had entered the market in the intervening time, only one - the Samsung Galaxy Tab - had the necessary level of 256-bit AES encryption.  The trust is using Vodafone for the roll out, which will see the mobile operator&apos;s Secure Device Manager software deployed on the devices.  BYOD won&apos;t save you money, says Blackpool ICT chief &gt;&gt; Guardian Government Computing On the one hand, costs up because there are more calls to the support desk; on the other, fewer desks and more flexible working.   &quot;Local authorities hoping to introduce similar [Bring Your Own Device] schemes should view it as a way of supporting employees and helping to bring about job satisfaction, according to [Blackpool head of ICT services Tony] Doyle.

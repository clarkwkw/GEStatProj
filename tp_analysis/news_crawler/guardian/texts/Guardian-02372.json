    "text": "Google is celebrating Mother&apos;s Day with a doodle that pays homage to the childish scrawls that many doting parents will wake up to on Sunday. The colourful graphic sees the search engine&apos;s logo crudely redrawn as if by a young hand armed with a box of crayons. The second and third letters of Google are transformed into a green-haired mother in a spotty dress beaming over her offspring. A squiggled yellow sun shines overhead, grass sprouts at their feet and love hearts fill the air. A pair of scattered crayons and an exclamation mark complete the image. Mothering Sunday is a regular feature on Google&apos;s varied calendar of doodles, but this year, unlike in 2011, the website has distinguished between different dates used by different countries. While the day is celebrated this year on 18 March in Britain, it falls on 13 May in America, Australia, New Zealand and numerous other countries. Last year, Google marked Mother&apos;s Day in May with a doodle in the style of a store-bought rather than a homemade card. It featured the logo as if printed on embossed paper. The letter &quot;l&quot; of Google was replaced by a simple purple flower.",

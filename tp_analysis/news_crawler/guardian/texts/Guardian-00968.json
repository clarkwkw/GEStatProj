    "text": "While finally finishing Uncharted 3 recently, I noticed something interesting about the puzzle design. In the Yemen section of the game, where Nathan and Sully explore a vast underground crypt, lots of the tasks are based around optical illusions  there&apos;s a room full of statue parts suspended at various angles, which must be viewed from a specific place to create a complete picture. In another area, a duo of strange symbols on a wall need to be looked at through a series of shutters in order to convert them into a zoetrope-style animated sequence. These ingenious puzzles are not only fun to solve, they accentuate the mysticism of the narrative. How did Naughty Dog come up with this brilliant idea? Ideas are the currency of creativity  yet strangely, we&apos;re often taught to undervalue them. There&apos;s an anecdote about Peter Molyneux being approached by a fan who told him, &quot;I have a great idea for a game,&quot; to which the famed designer replied: &quot;I have a great idea for a painting.&quot; Of course, an idea in itself is worthless; it&apos;s the implementation that&apos;s key. But if you&apos;re sitting in front of Game Maker 8.1 or your Unity3D interface, with plenty of coding nouse but no inspiration, how do you get started? &quot;It&apos;s all about reference material,&quot; said Andy Schatz, when I asked him about how newcomers to game design should think about ideas. Schatz is the designer of Monaco, an IGF award-winning co-op stealth game, tipped by many to be the crossover hit of 2012. &quot;All art is just an evolution of existing art. But the art we call innovative is the art that takes the biggest evolutionary leaps. Sometimes this takes a lot of experimentation to get right. Don&apos;t be afraid to take those leaps and throw out the experiments that don&apos;t work out!&quot; This is a widely accepted, glibly post-modernist stance on creativity  that there are no new ideas, just new combinations of existing concepts. At the Develop conference in Brighton last year, Mark Green  from the creative development group at Sony Worldwide Studios  gave an intriguing talk on how the company&apos;s in house studios came up with new ideas. &quot;A classical definition of a new idea is one or more existing ideas combined in a new way,&quot; he said. &quot;So we might take the idea of a monster movie, combine it with the idea of YouTube and come up with the idea of Cloverfield &quot; That essentially seems to be how Hollywood has operated for the past 30 years, but is it a dead end for indie developers who don&apos;t want to make the gaming equivalent of &quot;Godzilla on a shaky cam&quot;? Green doesn&apos;t think so  he sees investigating accepted game mechanics as a key way to spark inspiration. &quot;A lot of what we&apos;ve done has been about taking techniques that have been used in other industries,&quot; he says. &quot;There are very innovative companies working in product development  for example, the design consultancy IDEO is one. They use exercises that allow you to think differently about problems. &quot;There&apos;s one known as the challenge technique where you sit down and think about all the assumptions we have about something. Then you all start to remove some of those things to destabilise the fundaments and see how that can help generate new ideas.&quot;  In his Develop talk, Green discusses taking an accepted genre  the RTS for example  then writing down its six absolutely vital elements. There is some kind of battle going on, there are at least two sides, there are various units, there are resources, etc. Now the idea is to roll a dice and remove one of the tenets. What would the resulting game work like? Removing just one rule can result in a fundamentally different gameplay experience. &quot;There&apos;s another very simple exercise we sometimes carry out,&quot; Green says. &quot;It&apos;s called A+B. We print out a list of 200 game titles, put them in a hat, then pull two out. We might get something like Professor Layton and Call of Duty: Black Ops. That&apos;s not the end of the process  we&apos;re not literally going to make Call of Duty and the Curious Village. But what we&apos;re doing is using this unusual combination as a starting point. &quot;We may combine the theme of one with the gameplay of the other  so, perhaps a puzzle game with a military theme. Or it could be an FPS with strong puzzle elements. Or we&apos;d take the audience of one and apply it to the other  so a first-person shooter for family audiences. These are just good brain-storing start points, and this exercise take you down paths you may not previously have considered.&quot; This is a quite insular way of thinking about games and creativity, but it can work. Dan Marshall, the Bafta award-winning designer of games such as Time Gentlemen Please and Privates, is a great believer in immersing yourself in games and game culture. &quot;Go to the pub and talk about them,&quot; he says. &quot;Great ideas do come up like this  but you need to take a pen and some paper because otherwise they&apos;ll be lost forever in a half-drunken haze. &quot;Oh and play lots of games. Sometimes you expect a game to do something, but it goes in a totally different direction. Well, that thing you were hoping it would do is a completely original idea  it&apos;s all yours and you can use it yourself. Use other people&apos;s work as a springboard.&quot; It doesn&apos;t have to be new games either. Hideo Kojima, after all, became interested in the whole idea of stealth and avoidance by playing Space Invaders and hiding behind the defence shields. Charles Cecil, designer of the Broken Sword titles, agrees with the idea of immersing yourself in games, but sounds an extra note of caution. &quot;Don&apos;t try to write games in a genre that you don&apos;t have a passion for, because you will fail,&quot; he says. &quot;When you&apos;re coming up with ideas, try to keep in mind all the things you love about a genre, and innovate on those; add to them in an interesting way. You&apos;ve got to focus on what you love, but it has to be about the mechanics. &quot;It&apos;s no good saying, I&apos;m going to design an FPS that&apos;s based underwater, because that in no way suggests you&apos;re going to innovate on the gameplay itself. Everything needs to be driven by gameplay.&quot; In short, you need to think like an engineer rather than an artist. Although admittedly, art has proved a fecund source of game ideas. Tetsuya Mizuguchi was inspired by Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky to create Rez; Ken Levine drew on the Art Deco movement for Bioshock; Uncharted co-lead designer Richard Lemarchand looked at the works of Victorian painters such as David Roberts and Caspar David Friedrich for the exotic locations that Nathan Drake discovers. And countless dungeon designers have looked at the complex works of MC Escher and Giovanni Battista Piranesi for their labyrinthine environments.  Beyond art there is everything. Lemarchand talks about finding inspiration and awe in dramatic natural wonders  the Giant&apos;s Causeway, the fronds of a fern, the fractal self symmetry of Romanesco broccoli. &quot;I always try to get ideas for games from non-game sources,&quot; says Schatz. &quot;I like to think of game design the way Michelangelo thought of sculpting  he was just discovering the object inside of the stone, and the chisel was just there to reveal it. When you build a game out of a non-game concept, the designer has to whittle that subject matter down and find the game inside it. So I&apos;ve made games inspired by animal ecosystems, heist movies, conversations, documentaries&quot;  There is also biography and experience. Miyamoto was inspired to create Legend of Zelda by his childhood spent exploring the countryside near his home, and daring himself to wander into caves. Jenova Chen of thatgamecompany told Edge that he came up with the idea for Flower after seeing the grass fields along a Californian highway for the first time after arriving in the country from Shanghai. Ideas are experiences processed. But they are also about seeing the value in empty time. In a blog post titled Where do you get your ideas, an exasperated Neil Gaiman writes: &quot;You get ideas from daydreaming. You get ideas from being bored. You get ideas all the time. The only difference between writers and other people is we notice when we&apos;re doing it.&quot; The skill is in utilising these fleeting moments of inspiration. &quot;When you&apos;re making games, you&apos;re constantly having ideas that are brilliant but completely wrong for that project,&quot; says Marshall. &quot;So store them up in the back of your mind; every indie developer I know has a list of games tucked away in the damp, dark bits of their brain queuing up to be made. &quot;You should also keep tabs on the stuff you throw away: some game ideas are completely wrong for what you&apos;re working on, but sing in a different project. We killed time travel mechanics in Ben There, Dan That because it just didn&apos;t gel, but when we decided on a sequel it was the perfect fit.&quot; Interestingly, Hidetaka &quot;Swery&quot; Suehiro, the designer of cult survival horror adventure Deadly Premonition, has the exact opposite approach. In his GDC speech last year he provided a seven-point guide to game design and the last one was simply to use everything, every idea, whenever it occurs to you. Don&apos;t save it, don&apos;t lose it, just stick it in there. Hence, in Deadly Premonition, the town of Greenvale is shaped like a dog raising its paw. Swery had that idea and he put it in. This is the stuff that cult genius is made of.  One of the most important philosophical ideas about  ideas  is that they don&apos;t just pop into your head fully formed. The science writer Steven Johnson has a brilliant YouTube video explaining this, which I&apos;ve embedded below.            This reflects some advice on creativity in Richard Wiseman&apos;s excellent book 59 Seconds, which suggests that sometimes it&apos;s best to leave an idea and go off to do something else  a word puzzle, a long walk  anything to get your mind off the creative problem at hand, if only for a few minutes. He refers to the work of psychologists Ap Dijksterhuis and Teun Meurs from the University of Amsterdam; in a report titled, Where Creativity Resides: The Generative Power of Unconscious Thought, they posited that leaving a task for just a few moments allows your unconscious mind to have a bash at it, quietly working away on the logistics without your conscious thoughts bellowing in its ear. Dan Marshall puts this in very simple terms: &quot;&apos;Play&apos; the game in your head at night  this is where everything gets fleshed out, for me.&quot; It seems that retaining the purity of those early, half-unconscious ideas is the key to great games. Lemarchand discusses the process of &quot;design by subtraction&quot; during his fascinating talk, Beauty and Risk: Why I love indie Games, given at IndieCade and GameCity last year.             If you don&apos;t have time for the whole thing, forward to 15:00. Here, he talks about how his approach to design ideas is influenced by the &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy of William Morris  &quot;put nothing in your home that you don&apos;t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful&quot;. Game ideas are the same. This was also a concept employed by Fumito Ueda while designing the wonderful Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. In his classic 2002 GDC talk on the creation of the games (conveniently entitled Design by subtraction), he talks about how the idea for Ico came from just the idea of a young boy holding hands with a slightly older girl, and that every subsequent design decision was made to retain the purity of that image.  So back to those intriguing puzzles in Uncharted 3. Keen to find out how Naughty Dog arrived at them, I contacted Richard Lemarchand and asked him. He told me that his co-lead designer Jacob Minkoff actually created a huge open environment and filled it with optical illusions  he then toyed with each one until he had a couple that really worked; these are the ones we have in the final game. Sometimes creativity is just about putting yourself in a position where the only possible outcome is a good idea.",

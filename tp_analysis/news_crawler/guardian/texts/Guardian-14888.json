    "text": "Procrastination. The age-old nemesis of the student species. Lurking beneath desks, living inside your laptop and hiding in the library. It teases you with Facebook, dangles your favourite TV show in front of you, and convinces you that now really is a good time to read the Song of Ice and Fire saga. Or, at least, that&apos;s what we want to believe. Instead procrastination is merely an inability to dedicate our time appropriately to the task at hand. It is something that many students, myself included, do. This advice is not meant to condone laziness or leaving things to the last minute but as a guide for if you do happen, for whatever reason, to be zeroing in on deadline. Anyway, we all know you&apos;ll work harder next time... 1. Have your books nearby Before you start writing, work out what textbooks are likely to be of help and find them in the library. Having the texts beside you will reduce the time spent running around aimlessly trying to find a book. It also means that if someone has taken out the last copy, you can find a replacement early on. 2. Don&apos;t overreach yourself Yes, you want to get a good degree in the end. But if the deadline for this particular essay is hurtling towards you, this is not the time to be aiming for perfection. Read enough to do the essay. Once you&apos;ve finished it, if you still have time, you can add a bit more. Remember that handing in a complete essay will always net more marks than handing in unintelligible shards of writing. 3. Plan, plan, plan  Everyone works at a different speed and only you know how much is possible. Set a schedule where time is allocated to outlining, reading, and writing. Also, make sure that there is enough time left to double check the essay and bibliography. 4. Reference as you write  Speaking of the bibliography, do it while you write. It will save you from having to search through masses of textbooks to find that one quote used 10 hours ago. Failing this, at least it will make you bookmark pages that have been used. 5. Take regular breaks  This may seem counter intuitive but a break (watching a TV show, talking to a friend, or having a walk) keeps you awake, and alert. Taking time out is often helpful during troublesome sections, allowing you to think about the problem, and clear your mind, without having to stare at a blurry screen of text. 6. Stay away from sugar The immediate high may help but, especially during marathon sessions, the low can derail the entire session. Try substituting fruit or cereal for chocolate bars and biscuits. The odd chocolate biscuit will not do too much harm but munching away constantly doesn&apos;t help. 7. Ban yourself from Facebook  This could mean the difference between getting your essay done or wasting valuable time checking what your flatmates are eating for dinner. Pass your details on to a trustworthy friend, or family member, and get them to change the password; with strict rules not to give it back to you until you hand in the essay. Trust me, your work will reap the benefits.  Or use a productivity tool such as Leechblock, that&apos;ll keep you away from social media for set periods. Spending time on an essay, and doing it in advance, will always provide the best results (and put you in the lecturer&apos;s good books.) But we all stray sometimes, so try not to rush through your work and stay calm. One advantage of starting late is that the whole horrible ordeal will soon be over.",

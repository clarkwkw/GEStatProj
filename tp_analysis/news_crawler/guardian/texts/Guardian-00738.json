Savage-looking peaks have been glimpsed through ragged holes in billowing cloud, the hills seamed with waterfalls and all the birds  bar a solitary raven I spot  blown from the sky. Everywhere in Loweswater are glimpses of the tops, like the magnificent west face of Grasmoor, its verdant skirts of Lanthwaite Green spread out below and strafed with hail. In the far distance is piano-black Honister crag jutting proud from Fleetwith Pike at the head of Buttermere, with glimpses of Haystacks, High Crag and High Stile all rock-strewn and sleety as they march in file towards Red Pike through vaporous clouds, and with the silvery patina of Crummock Water below. Closer still, near the Kirkstile Inn and Loweswater church, the one set across the road from the other, is mighty Melbreak, split by a defile known as the Chimney and with its face astream with rivulets. It was from there that a sheepdog fell to its death while gathering sheep, its farmer Chris Todd of this parish remembering  as he wipes spots of drizzle from his wire-framed spectacles  how he sat down and wept after the dog had tried to get up from where it lay, but fell down dead. This dales farmer, who arrived to hill farming relatively late having started on the flatlands around Wigton, now knows these crags well. His allegiance, he says, is with the dog-gathering sheep on the high fells rather than the sheepdog-trials dog obeying commands in a field  also a subject he knows and in which he excels. Last year, on Box hill above the fleshpots of Dorking, his dog Tess won the Outrun, Fetch and Lift class in the International Sheepdog Trials. This white-haired shepherd still keeps some Swaledales, but is retired now at 78.",

    "text": "The plans for a new school lie redundant on a table. They were turned down for government funding last month. Crammed into a hallway alcove, deputy head Patrick Williams is balancing his laptop on a child&apos;s desk in his &quot;office&quot;  a space he shares with the books in the school&apos;s tiny reading area. He pulls in his knees when the children file out of their last class. Outside, a portable cabin that has seen better days houses the 60 children of years 5 and 6. All of the school&apos;s classrooms are too small for the 30 children in each to have any kind of space to move off their chairs, work in groups or have quiet time. There is no storage space, and the teachers squeeze between the desks as they try to move between their pupils. St John&apos;s Angell Town Church of England primary in Brixton, in the London borough of Lambeth, is, says its head Martin Clark, &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. &quot;There is visible asbestos in the kitchen, water marks all over the walls. We&apos;ve just had the roof patched, but there are about 100 other leaks in it,&quot; he said. &quot;Many of our children come from cramped households, overcrowded homes with no outside space. They get here into a cramped school, more barriers for them in a far from ideal environment. It is a great challenge to create spaces within the school for children to learn and to be themselves.&quot; About 250 children are squeezed into the school and next year&apos;s reception class is already full. But in this area of Lambeth alone, the population is predicted to double by 2020. Clark, who has turned StJohn&apos;s around from &quot;failing&quot; in the last four years, smiles and shrugs when asked how the school might cope. &quot;The pressures on schools like ours are always there  now they are escalating.&quot; As birthrates dropped in the 1990s, the number of children in state primary schools in England and Wales peaked in 1999 at 4.3 million and began to fall in 2000, reaching a low of 3.95 million in 2009. But since 2002 birthrates have been rising. In 2010, the number of primary school pupils began to increase. By 2015 it was estimated there would be 4.39 million, a rise of around 10% compared to 2011. By 2020 this will grow to 4.8 million, 20% higher than the figure for 2011. These government figures are now thought to be an underestimate after census figures were higher than expected. But the child bulge could not have come at a worse time for local authorities. The government scaled back school-building programmes immediately after the election in 2010, and maintenance, repair and expansion projects were shelved. Meanwhile, benefit cuts are forcing families to move to areas where rental prices are cheaper, causing population growth and even more pressure on places in poorer areas. In Lambeth, the fourth most densely populated local authority in England and Wales, a &quot;terrible perfect storm&quot; is brewing, said councillor Rachel Heywood. &quot;We lost 140m when the new government came in and scrapped the Building Schools for the Future programme. We see here in Lambeth a complete failure of new and present policies to understand the social and financial situation of children and families living in areas like this. &quot;We can&apos;t predict what&apos;s going to happen with the welfare reforms. We know it will have a massive impact in this, an area with significant deprivation, and a lot of families will be on the move with a massive impact on children. A school like this can be the glue in a community. This is the early intervention that helps not just children who are critically vulnerable but their families too. Numbers are a massive problem  our schools are overwhelmed. We are working hard but at the moment we still have children without a school for September.&quot; Across London, the 33 local authorities that make up the London Councils group estimate that together they will need a further 70,000 primary school places by 2014 despite the many millions government has pumped in. Steve Reed, leader of Lambeth council, said there had been a huge rush of late applications for places. &quot;In Lambeth, we have had around 300 late applications since April. These are children for whom at present there are no places. This is far higher than in previous years. We are looking at a real problem here.&quot; London councils have been discussing a range of emergency stopgap measures, such as using empty office space and teaching in school halls. Portable temporary buildings  already a feature of many playgrounds  are being increasingly used. In Barking and Dagenham, about 180m has been spent since 2010 on new schools and expanding existing ones  a sizeable sum, but far less than the 300m that would have come the borough&apos;s way under the original Building Schools for the Future plans scrapped by education secretary Michael Gove soon after he arrived in the job. Rocky Gill, the deputy leader of Barking and Dagenham council, responsible for education, has looked at the feasibility of using disused shops, including former MFI and Woolworth stores, for schools in the next few years. He has talked to headteachers about introducing &quot;split shift&quot; teaching, a system used in beleaguered Gaza, where pupils would be divided into morning or afternoon shifts. The early shift would run from 8am to 1pm and the later one from 2pm to 7pm. &quot;If you run out of space the key benefit of this is that you can use the same premises twice a day, to teach two lots of children,&quot; he said. Gill&apos;s borough has seen dramatic demographic change in recent years because housing is cheaper than in inner London. Much of its elderly population has been replaced by young families escaping high costs in other areas of the capital. The council estimates that the number of children up to four years old in the borough increases by about 150 a month, while the birthrate in 2010 was 58% higher than in 2000. Gill estimates an additional 50m a year will be needed to provide enough school places for each of the next 10 years. It&apos;s not only in London. Reading council received 2,144 applications for a place at primary school this year  an increase of just under 10% from 1,947 in 2011. In Hampshire, the Department for Education predicts a shortfall of 1,778 places by 2015-16 in Southampton alone, the equivalent of three new schools. Across England and Wales, tens of thousands more places will be needed. In Leeds, councillor Judith Blake, the city council&apos;s executive member for children&apos;s services, said that rises in the birthrate and the movement of many people from more expensive to cheaper areas raised fundamental questions. &quot;At the moment we have got places for all primary school children but not all of them will have got in to their first-choice schools,&quot; she said. &quot;We are lobbying government for more money. We are having to build new houses and provide new school places at a time when money is tight. The pressure is coming at us from all directions.&quot; In Bristol, classrooms are popping up in the most unlikely places as the city faces one of the biggest child population increases in the country. At least 3,000 additional places will be needed between 2011 and 2015  possibly more if housebuilding resumes  at a cost of 150m, considerably more than the council has secured funding for. Bristol has already seen a 23% rise in the numbers of children starting school over the last six years, to more than 5,000. The increase is put down to several factors, including the city&apos;s growing popularity, the fact that families across all social groups are having more than two children, and immigration. But the solution is not as simple as just building new accommodation. Many primaries are on constricted sites. So conversion of vacant buildings, from an army reservists&apos; base to a former tobacco warehouse, is being considered. The council has bought a former police station to convert and one Victorian primary has had six &quot;modular classrooms&quot;  as the council calls portable buildings  installed on the roof. Rob Worsfold, the headteacher of the heavily oversubscribed Air Balloon Hill primary in St George, said he was delighted that work had begun on a 5m expansion to put an end to the annual ritual of tearful parents complaining in his office. These days getting a place is one thing, but ensuring siblings go to the same school is quite another. Increasingly brothers and sisters are ending up at different schools, making the daily school run a logistical nightmare for parents. And from Lambeth to Bristol to Bradford, education authorities are coming under pressure to change the sibling rule. While local authorities have a legal obligation to provide a place within two miles of a child&apos;s home, this is measured as the crow flies, not along bus or buggy-friendly routes. Often, parents who have chosen a property because of vicinity to a successful school are shocked to find their child cannot get in or that siblings face being split up because the pressure on places is so great. In many areas government policy is fuelling the ill feeling among parents as &quot;free schools&quot; are opened in areas where need is not the greatest. &quot;That is not ideal,&quot; said Heywood in Lambeth. &quot;Our shortages are in the south and a free school is opening in the north; it creates mayhem with planning.&quot; Bristol is encouraging schools to open annexes and operate as split-site schools, but it cannot force schools to expand. That is up to the governors and many worry about overcrowding and the detrimental effect on children of larger and larger schools. Primary school expansion is also hugely unpopular with parents. Many local authorities are &quot;bribing&quot; schools to take in an extra reception class. Meanwhile, the bulge will soon be moving through to create the same problems with secondary schools. With no one really counting how our population is shifting and with the impact of benefit cuts still to be understood, it is anyone&apos;s guess where our children might be taught in the long term. In Brixton, Elizabeth Ajinu holds her toddler&apos;s hand as she collected her six-year-old son. &quot;It is a shame to see the teachers working so hard and then this building is crumbling down. That is bad to hear they are not building a new school as we hoped,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope my daughter will not be getting a place in a school at the other end of Brixton because I won&apos;t be able to work very many hours if I have to run from school to school. Why did no one know there were more children. Does no onecount?&quot;",

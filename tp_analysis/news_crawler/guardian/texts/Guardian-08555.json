    "text": "The dilemma Years ago I used refillable tubes of mascara. Then this product disappeared  I assume the company realised it could make more money selling a single-use, disposable version. This is very irritating for aconscious consumer. Vivienne Lucy replies The road to a dewy complexion and smoky eyes is littered with single-use plastic receptacles, hygiene layers of yet more composite plastics, rigid boxes and over-engineered mascara wands (some with batteries and integrated mirrors). Globally the cosmetics and personal-care industry racks up some 120.8bn units of packaging a year. It is nearly all of the single-use variety. Even if make-up seems a small part of your life, its trail of debris is nearly visible from space. But the tub (as I&apos;m inexpertly naming any cosmetics receptacle) doesn&apos;t generate much income for cosmetics companies. In many cases they&apos;d like to minimise this cost in favour of greater margin. Plus, internationally, cosmetic manufacturers increasingly find themselves under pressure from governments and consumers to minimise packaging (it&apos;s not just the UK where landfill taxes are growing each year). If I were an eco designer I&apos;d be looking at the world of cosmetics to make my fortune. Almost every brand is experimenting with a greener way of delivering its lotions and potions. Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, packages a range in bioplastic derived from &quot;sustainable&quot; South American sugar cane and Aveda claims to savemore than 450 tonnes of virgin plastic per year by using post-consumer recycled plastic. Neal&apos;s Yard also follows this strategy. With so much eco innovation going on, I can&apos;t help thinking your much-missed mascara company wasa bit hasty in removing your favourite product from sale. Don&apos;t be too surprised to see it back. While you wait for this happy day, I&apos;m pleased to tell you that there are still refillable mascara tubes on the market such as Tana (from makkicosmetics.com). There&apos;s also arecently launched high-end version, Noir G de Guerlain. Its components look over-engineered to me but the headline still stands: it&apos;s refillable! The courageous brands challenge the very notion of cosmetics swaddled in packaging and dare to go bare. I&apos;m thinking of the semi-naked and naked products of Lush (lush.co.uk). The company campaigns for environmental sanity  when it does resort to tubs, they are later converted into stationery. These are the true beauties. Sadly, Lush doesn&apos;t seem to do a refillable mascara. Green crush of the week Apparently National Nut Day, 22 October, is abig deal in the US, but it is tragically overlooked on these shores. Our nut consumption isn&apos;t what it could be either, according to fairtrade-nut producers Liberation Foods. Nuts and &quot;nutty&quot; legumes such as Brazil nuts, cashews, peanuts and walnuts are a helpful low-impact alternative to meat. &quot;A key to sustaining our planet is for the richer half of the world to switch some meat consumption to relatively unprocessed plant-based products such as nuts,&quot; says agri-environmental scientist Dr Donal Murphy-Bokern. Distilled advice: go nuts! Greenspeak: Diamond dirt {daemend der:t} noun The murky provenance of the stones is well discussed, but this is the secret pollution from the on-site scrubbing of diamond ore in ferrosilicon mix.

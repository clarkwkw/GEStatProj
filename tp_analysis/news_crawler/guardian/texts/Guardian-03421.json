    "text": "Science Weekly takes a comic turn when we meet the trio behind Festival of the Spoken Nerd: Helen Arney (who provides our theme tune and musical interludes on the show), Matt Parker and Steve Mould. The festival is a touring variety show that entertains and educates science-loving audiences around the UK.  Helen, Matt and Steve also discuss this week&apos;s science news with Alok Jha, including the discovery of the Majorana particle and why the world&apos;s penguin population seems to have suddenly increased. Finally, Alok meets Dick Taverne, founder of Sense About Science, to discuss his forthcoming lecture &quot;What has science ever done for us?&quot; The lecture marks the 10th birthday of the organisation, which campaigns tirelessly for greater public understanding of science.

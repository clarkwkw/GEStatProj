    "text": "It was a walk past a frozen lake 10 years ago that got Ian Tansley thinking differently about global health. The Welsh inventor had spent decades travelling and developing solar technologies throughout Africa and Asia. Yet one puzzle he was keen to crack  how to deliver vaccines on a wide-scale basis to the poorest, most remote communities  had so far eluded him. Vaccines are notoriously hard to deliver safely, requiring refrigeration at certain temperatures, which means having access to a constant power supply. Yet hot climates, intermittent availability of electricity, supply shortages and unreliable storage facilities mean that one in five children  more than 19m worldwide  do not get even the most basic immunisations to keep them healthy.

The refrigeration compartment is surrounded by water, and relies on the fact that the liquid is at its heaviest at 4C, when it sinks. When the device has power, the water cools and forms ice above the compartment, leaving only water at 4C cooling the contents. When the power is switched off, the water warms and rises while the ice begins to melt, and water at 4C remains below to keep the vaccines chilled. Sure Chill  which was awarded a $1.5m (1.2m) Grand Challenges grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is now used to deliver vaccines in 38 countries  has proved a major breakthrough in global health. Tansleys immunisations cold-box can keep vaccines cool for up to 35 days in even 43C weather. And the technology is entirely scaleable, from a cool box up to a warehouse.  Naming it one of the top four innovations saving childrens lives, the Gates Foundations director of vaccine delivery, Dr Orin Levine, calls Sure Chill an important tool in humanitarian response efforts and says it demonstrates, for the first time in decades, a global health issue benefiting from significant innovation. Innovation is the theme of this years Grand Challenges global conference, taking place in London this week. Experts from all over the world will address key questions in tackling global health challenges, including innovations in achieving the sustainable development goals, treating infectious diseases, and developing collaborations between north and south. Equally problematic in the global health challenge is poor sanitation: 40% of the worlds population currently lacks adequate toilet facilities, which in turn contributes to poor health and devastating environmental impacts.

Developed by Virginia Gardiner, an American journalist-turned-industrial design engineer, Loowatt has had a massive impact in Madagascar, where a pilot public toilet project has grown to provide 100 toilets for private use within family homes, and is set to be rolled out across other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The toilets seal waste into a portable cartridge within biodegradable film, and combine anaerobic digestion with pasteurisation in order to kill off any waterborne diseases. The waste is collected and converted into fertiliser and biogas, which is then used for cooking and electricity. The toilets are particularly essential in regions where waterborne diseases are prevalent, or where shared  or a complete lack of  toilets prevent women and girls from going to the bathroom, says Gardiner. People are going from having pit latrines at home to our toilets in their homes, which means theyre not being exposed to eco-pathogens in their everyday lives any more, says Gardiner. The current model can support 2,000 people  in urban or rural settings  and is important in showing that in this global sanitation crisis, there is technology out there than can convert waste into energy. Both Gardiners and Tansleys systems get to the heart of what the Grand Challenges are about  improving the lives of the worlds most vulnerable. Tansley has been surprised at just how much his Sure Chill technology has changed the face of medical outreach. The people benefiting the most are generally the poorest people in the most remote places, the people you just wouldnt normally see: rural agricultural communities far from any infrastructure or power grid, he says. Maybe theyre nomadic or very dispersed  theyre people who werent being reached before.",

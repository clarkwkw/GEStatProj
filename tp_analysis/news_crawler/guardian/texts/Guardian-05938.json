    "text": "E3 is the international games industry&apos;s annual bunfight, a jam-packed gathering for which new announcements are hoarded and luminaries duly trundled out. This year&apos;s show lacked really big news, with Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony all simply making different-shaped bids for the increasingly hotly contested place underneath your telly. But there were still a few surprises nestled among the home-entertainment promises and sequels, including Watch Dogs (platforms to be confirmed), about a man who combs digital information from anything nearby, listening to phone calls, searching medical records and changing traffic lights in a fascinating revision of superpowers for the smartphone era. Bounty hunt &apos;em-up, Star Wars 1313 (platforms to be confirmed) looks so beautiful there&apos;s hope it may finally be a Star Wars game that&apos;s not witheringly dreadful. Meanwhile, Tomb Raider (PS3, Xbox) is getting another reboot, this time featuring a 21-year-old Lara Croft, and Assassin&apos;s Creed III (PS3, Xbox, PC) swaps the cultural Renaissance-era setting for the American revolution.  Nintendo     Pikmin 3    Even though it was revealed last year, Nintendo&apos;s Wii U held on to the distinction of being E3&apos;s only new featured hardware. Its GamePad is a controller-meets-touchscreen affair which even comes with its own buzzword, &quot;asymmetric&quot; gaming, in which players with GamePads take on separate, often adversarial roles. In single-player games the second screen supplies versatile support, such as keeping track of four discrete leaders in forthcoming bucolic real-time strategy game Pikmin 3, or allowing Batman to analyse his surroundings in Arkham City: Armoured Edition. In terrifying-looking survival horror ZombiU the GamePad becomes scanner, bludgeon and real-time inventory in a game where each character you play has only one life. A life that is short, tragic and very eventful.  Sony     Wonderbook    Rumours of PlayStation 4 revelations turned out to be disappointingly unfounded, leaving Sony to talk about re-emerging favourites such as God Of War: Ascension, in which yet more mythological beasts get the slow-motion vivisection treatment. There were new games too, the most exciting of which was Beyond: Two Souls, about the life of a girl with strange (and obviously incredibly destructive) powers, made by the Frenchmen who brought you the emotionally charged and experimental Heavy Rain. Sony also demonstrated the Wonderbook, which uses a PlayStation camera to animate the pages of specially designed books. The book they used was Harry Potter&apos;s Book Of Spells, in which you can cast your own spells by using the PS Move wand and adding a bit of fancy wrist work. Microsoft     Halo 4    Having seen Wii U at last year&apos;s E3, Microsoft clearly decided two-screen gaming was a box it desperately needed to tick. Using an app called SmartGlass, players&apos; Android, iOS or Windows tablets will be able to interact with Xbox, though at this stage Microsoft&apos;s attention seemed more focused on films and entertainment, with games support discussed in vaguer terms. There were also new software announcements, with Halo 4 becoming the latest franchise to try a TV-style episodic format, in which five new missions will be added each week.",

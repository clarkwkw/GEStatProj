    "text": "Some heartening news from Capcom this morning. The publisher is set to release a new version of its absolutely lovely adventure game Okami, a tragically overlooked PlayStation 2 title with astonishing cell-shaded visuals.  The game follows Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu as she returns to Earth in the shape of a wolf in order to defeat a demon who has turned the planet into a wasteland. It&apos;s essentially an action adventure, based around mythological themes, but players can also use a &quot;celestial brush&quot; to battle enemies as well as paint in the landscapes and return Earth to its former natural beauty. The watercolour visuals are designed to resemble the Japanese ink illustrations known as sumi-e, and they are breathtaking at times.  The game was designed by Capcom&apos;s now defunct Clover Studio, which also worked on Viewtiful Joe and the offbeat fighting game, God Hand. Key members of the team went on to found Platinum Games, the creator of Vanquish, MadWorld and Bayonetta. Indeed, Okami designer Hideki Kamiya is now overseeing Platinum&apos;s E3 hit, Project P-100.  The new version of the title, set to be released this autumn via PSN, will support the PlayStation Move controller, allowing player to paint with gestures  however, the Dual Shock pad is also supported. Meanwhile, any Nintendo owners reading this should check out the Wii conversion of the original game as well as the interesting DS sequel, kamiden, a smash hit in Japan that was, again, rather overlooked in the West.",

    "text": "Well after sunset we began skirting round a wood that enticed us with all its wares hung out to dry. We passed alongside fragrant washes of honeysuckle and lingered over flossy white blooms of wild privet, sniffing for sweetness. Tunnelled through the thick undergrowth were low-arched entrances and exits for creatures to pass in and out as they pleased. Butthere was no way for us to breach the tight tree-and-bush barrier. From time to time, we came to fragments of medieval meadow, unploughed and unsprayed, secure within irregular edges of the wood. Here and there were scarlet pimpernels and stands of yellow rattle flowers which had almost lost their yellow, but not yet gained the rattle of ripe seedpods. In time, the shaking seeds that gave the plant its name would indicate a hay crop ready for cutting. Black and leather-brown slugs crossed our path and we took care to step over them. We could not help treading on invisible snails in the grass, which popped like bubble wrap underfoot. In the twilight, we could just make out an animal on its haunches that we took for ahare until it fled in a rabbity lollop. The skies above were untimely black and we caught a quickening breeze. At last we found an opening, a squeeze of an entrance into the east side of the wood. We stepped inside, straddling puddles in the gloopy clay, avoiding slugs that showed only as dark smears. The light ash tree trunks gave a luminous glow. A great wind came over the wood, the sound of a giant brushing his fingers through the treetops. I felt wetness on my hands and cheeks. Was it rain or was this a leafy shakedown from an earlier downpour? In the dank murk, the paths that criss-crossed the interior were too dimly remembered and I realised that, in less than an hour, my underdeveloped senses had been almost stripped. But a faint light lingered beyond the trees and I knew that west meant homewards. We pressed on down the so familiar yet unfamiliar track.",

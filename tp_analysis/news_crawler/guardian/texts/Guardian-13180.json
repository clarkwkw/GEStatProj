    "text": "Madonna (madonna) It&apos;s only in its early stages, but Madonna&apos;s account shows real promise. While most stars like to demonstrate what nice normal people they are, these pictures offer a truly frightening glimpse of life as the Margaret Thatcher of pop. So far we know she likes children (presumably her own), the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and scaring photographers. It&apos;s most ungallant of Instagram to threaten her with dismissal for &quot;mature content&quot;. It would be a great loss to humanity if this were shut down.Typical shot: Sections of Madonna&apos;s face glaring at you.Beware: &quot;Addicted to sweat&quot;.Post frequency: Two or three a week.Pet content: One horse, rear view. Jamie Oliver (jamieoliver)     Oliver's posts are pally and food-obsessed. Photograph: Instagram    The artist formerly known as the Naked Chef has made Instagram yet another outpost of his multimedia empire, bringing us a 14th helping of what we already know and feel ambivalent about. Expect incessant enthusiasm for food, chummy relationships with anything that moves, and a tastefully glossy sheen covering it all. When a fox killed his black swan on Saturday, he gave us a poignant photograph of the bloodstained eggs, when what we really want is video of him chasing it around with a boning knife.Typical shot: &quot;Pimped chocolate tiramisu&quot;.Beware: Evidence of perfect family.Post frequency: Daily.Pet content: Low (swan aside). Kim Kardashian (kim kardashian)     Kim Kardashian's stream is generally about fashion and attention seeking.  Photograph: Instagram    She knows what the public wants, that Kim Kardashian, and luckily it&apos;s exactly what she wants to give them: ceaseless half-clothed pouting surrounded by evidence of money. If this account shows us the real Kim, then her image as a clothes- and attention-obsessed numbskull is fully earned. If it doesn&apos;t, she&apos;s a genius.Typical shot: Dcolletage having dinner; decolletage after the apocalypse; dcolletage taking a hard-earned break..Beware: Vapid handwritten homilies.Approximate post frequency: Daily.Pet content: Low, unless you count children. Rihanna (badgalriri)     One of the few places Rihanna can't smoke. Photograph: Instagram    What the kids don&apos;t understand about life as an international pop star and glamour icon is how much smoking you have to do to achieve your dreams. Rihanna&apos;s account puts the record straight, along with a few subtle hints about what precisely you need to smoke in order to be as cool as her. The price we pay is rather a lot of stoned wisdom.Typical shot: Rihanna&apos;s bottom.Beware: Her Jesus days.Post frequency: Near-constant.Pet content: None. Lena Dunham (lenadunham)     Lena Dunham without her dog. Photograph: Instagram    It&apos;s fair to say that this is not a very airbrushed picture of Dunham&apos;s daily life. It also seems fair to say that Dunham&apos;s daily life involves mostly pottering about in comfortable clothes and being witty to her dog. At least she is witty, which is a rare quality on Instagram, especially among celebrities.Typical shot: Friend beneath duvet, 2013.Beware: Fishing for compliments.Post frequency: Daily.Pet content: High, always dog. Justin Bieber (justinbieber)     Enter the strange and hilarious world of Justin Bieber. Photograph: Instagram    If it&apos;s a choice between him and Harry Styles, stick with the original. Styles gives more or less the picture of boyband life you might expect: backstage hijinks and views from hotel windows. Bieber, on the other hand, has had a few years&apos; practice, and has become entertainingly strange. At times worrying. At others, probably not worth thinking too much about. But always unintentionally hilarious.Typical shot: Look, I&apos;m even handsome sideways!Beware: Weird self-mythologising.Post frequency: Twice a day.Pet content: Low, but a lot of younger relatives.",

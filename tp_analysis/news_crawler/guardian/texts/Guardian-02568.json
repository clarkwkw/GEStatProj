    "text": "As Nick Clegg dismisses &quot;insinuations&quot; from Argentina&apos;s foreign minister that Britain has sent a nuclear-armed submarine to the Falkland Islands, it&apos;s worth reading the words of one of the first Englishmen to set foot on the Falklands from a Royal Navy warship, shortly after Britain raised the flag on the islands. In his diary he records:  The first news we received was to our astonishment that England had taken possession of the Falkland Islands. These islands have been for some time uninhabited, until the Buenos Ayres [sic] government, a few years since claimed them and sent some colonists. Our government remonstrated against this and last month the Clio arrived here with orders to take possession of the place. A Buenos Ayrean man of war was here at the time with some fresh colonists. Both they and the vessel returned to the Rio Plata.&quot;  Writing on 1 March 1833, the diarist was mistaken in his dates. HMS Clio&apos;s crew had landed not in February but on 2 January. They sent the colonists from the &quot;United Provinces of the River Plate&quot; packing on 5 January. Before the South Americans&apos; arrival, the total population of the Falklands had been &quot;one Englishman, who has resided here for some years, and now has the charge of the English flag, 20 Spaniards and three women&quot;.  The writer also noted the wildlife of the islands: &quot;There are about 5,000 wild oxen, many horses, and pigs. Wild fowl, rabbits, and fish in the greatest plenty.&quot; It is a little known footnote to early Falkands history that HMS Beagle (a fully armed man o&apos; war, despite its peaceful orders) and its supernumerary Charles Darwin made such an early visit to the newly British Falkland Islands. The captain of HMS Beagle, Robert Fitzroy, had been given an extensive list of South American coastlines and ports to survey and chart as part of his orders from the Admiralty and Hydrographic Office. Having surveyed Tierra del Fuego, Beagle was directed to proceed to the Falklands.  At the time the orders were written in 1831, the ownership of the Falklands was in dispute between Buenos Aires and Britain. Captain Fitzroy had been ordered to visit the Falklands and prepare a report for the Admiralty. The islands&apos; one longstanding British resident, a Mr Dixon, visited Beagle on 2 March. &quot;What a strange solitary life his must be,&quot; Darwin wrote in his Beagle Diary, &quot;it is surprising to see how Englishmen find their way to every corner of the globe.&quot; Darwin observed of the inhabitants of East Falkland: &quot;Their habitations are in a miserable condition and deficient in almost every accommodation. The place bespeaks what it has been, viz a bone of contention between different nations.&quot; Darwin found life ashore sparse, and recorded: &quot;10th to Sunday 17th this is one of the quietest places we have ever been to  no one event has happened during the whole week.&quot;  However, his naturalist&apos;s soul was impressed by the waters surrounding the islands: &quot;I have been very busy with the zoology of the sea; the treasures of the deep to a naturalist are indeed inexhaustible.&quot; Beagle left the Falklands on 6 April 1833, sailing ahead of &quot;a gale of wind&quot;. They left behind, on East Falkland, the grave of Edward Hellyer, Beagle&apos;s clerk, who had drowned while trying to recover a bird he had shot. Fitzroy returned to the South American mainland to complete his surveys of the Patagonian coast, during which time Darwin made five great inland expeditions. The Beagle&apos;s captain was nothing if not thorough, and dissatisfied with his earlier surveys of the Falklands he returned his vessel to the islands in March the following year.  As Beagle weighed anchor on 7 April 1834 (with a torrid rounding of Cape Horn in store), Darwin wrote that the recent arrival of some gauchos on the islands would allow wild cattle to be caught for the subsistence of the colony. &quot;Perhaps this may be the first start in that prosperity which these islands must ultimately obtain.&quot; Peter McGrath is a director of the HMS Beagle Trust",

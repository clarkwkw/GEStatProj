    "text": "There is a palpable excitement at Park View business and enterprise school. The staff and pupils would probably be shouting it from the rooftop, were the rooftop not out of bounds because of the crane positioned above it. The school&apos;s new Ofsted report has just been published and so it&apos;s official  the inner-city Birmingham secondary is the first &quot;outstanding&quot; school of 2012 and the first to receive the inspectors&apos; highest accolade under its new inspection framework. The previous 27 judgments have been cut down to just four main key areas  achievement, quality of teaching, behaviour and safety, and leadership and management - to simplify the process and make it easier for schools to keep track of progress. Members of Park View&apos;s senior management team are feeling pleased with themselves. This school has been on a remarkable journey in the last 16 years, the latest stage of which will culminate in academy status this summer. It has clawed its way out of special measures from being, according to the league tables, the worst school in England&apos;s second city to becoming one of the best, and all this in Alum Rock, an area notorious for social disadvantage and gang culture. Just 4% of pupils were gaining five or more A-C grades at GCSE in the late 1990s  last summer that figure was 72%. This is a remarkable school in many ways. Almost all pupils are Muslim, yet Park View is run by a white female headteacher and a Sikh deputy. Lindsey Clark, the headteacher, is able to reel off the names of the three pupils out of a cohort of 600 who are not of the Islamic faith. &quot;I suppose it sounds a bit odd, but somehow it works,&quot; she says. Colleagues at Clark&apos;s previous school, a successful all-girls secondary, tried to dissuade her from coming to Park View in 2001. At the time, the school had a reputation in Birmingham as attracting and catering for children with special needs, the excluded and disaffected  in other words, the pupils other schools didn&apos;t want. &quot;Parents wanted academic results, but they also wanted their children to be safe and secure,&quot; says Hardeep Saini, the deputy head. &quot;Fathers would accompany their daughters into the classroom and then pick them up again after lessons. There was very little trust. &quot;This wasn&apos;t a bad school, it was just bumbling along. We didn&apos;t have behaviour problems, but those early inspections and league tables of the 1990s had exposed how bad things were academically.&quot; In last month&apos;s inspection, 94% of lessons were judged good or outstanding. This was despite the school being little more than a building site as its BSF programme is completed. The journey to academic success for Park View has been long and arduous. Clark recalls how, years earlier, one prospective teacher was asked at interview what it would take to get half of pupils achieving five or more top-grade GCSEs. The applicant replied: &quot;Pigs will fly. You will have to bus pupils in from other areas.&quot; Pupil attitudes also had to change. &quot;We really clamped down on coursework and attendance at exams about five years ago, and staff were despatched to round up pupils from their homes and drive them to school,&quot; Clark says. &quot;One girl turned up in her pyjamas and dressing gown to sit an exam after she&apos;d overslept and we sent out a taxi to get her. &quot;We had to peel back the layers and change hearts and minds. The only time we failed to get a pupil into the exam room was when he was banged up in a police cell and the custody officer said he was not allowed to sit the paper in there.&quot; Clark and her team of mainly young and dynamic assistant heads are as honest as they are uncompromising about the challenges they still face. &quot;You have to see this school in the context of its surroundings,&quot; Saini says. &quot;We have turf wars in the neighbourhood between Somalis and Pakistanis. There are knife attacks, gangs and drugs on the streets. &quot;A while ago, we heard a commotion outside the school and one of our former pupils was lying, spread-eagled, on the ground with a gun at his head, and a police helicopter hovering above. He managed to say &apos;hello Sir&apos; before being taken away.&quot; Building relationships with parents has also been crucial. &quot;They have to understand their role as co-educators,&quot; Saini adds. &quot;It&apos;s no good handing over their children to us and saying &apos;we want them to have a better life than us&apos;. If they want their children to become doctors or lawyers, then we have to do this together. &quot;All along we have been out to prove that inner-city kids can achieve just as well as anyone else, so we had to kick out of our thinking any notions that this was not possible.&quot; This attitude was not lost on inspectors, who gave the school an &quot;outstanding&quot; grading in all key areas. The only room for improvement, they said, was to increase the number of A* and A grades at GCSE. Clark and her team are not complacent, but you get the feeling they knew they would sail through this inspection. With the certain knowledge that their turn for a visit was imminent, they prepared for it. They spent several Saturday mornings at the school re-writing and fine-tuning the self-evaluation (an optional document that can be shown to inspectors) and improvement plan, &quot;taking out all the waffle&quot; and using a business model as a template. &quot;It enabled us immediately to provide evidence of what we were doing when the inspectors asked us, without rushing around looking for bits of paper,&quot; says Clark. &quot;It meant we were ready, with just two days&apos; notice. It also helps us to see exactly where we are, and what we still need to do to improve. The inspectors said it was exemplary.&quot; She says the new procedures felt like the inspection was &quot;less done to, and more done with&quot; the school. Both she and Saini were invited into lesson observations and to sit in on inspectors&apos; deliberations, enabling them to explain the school&apos;s policies and processes directly. &quot;We were asked to participate in a way we had never been before,&quot; Clark says. Inspectors spent a great deal of time talking to pupils, both formally and informally, during break-times, says Clark. &quot;One of the four new focuses of inspections is the safety and behaviour of pupils, so inspectors were keen to know how well the school dealt with matters such as bullying. &quot;They told us it was refreshing to hear pupils admit that bullying happened, but was not tolerated, and that generally they felt safe and secure in the school.&quot; Clark adds: &quot;It has been a long road to get here, but this inspection has finally confirmed that we are doing it right.&quot;",

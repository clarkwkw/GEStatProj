    "text": "How is the world doing at tackling global poverty? So many global development challenges come back to this root issue. Join the debate with us to unpick the progress so far and discuss what&apos;s to come. Last month, the World Bank said new data on global poverty suggested the international target to halve the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a day was met in 2010, five years ahead of schedule. The bank tempered the announcement by noting that 1 billion people would still be living in extreme poverty come 2015, and that many continue to live in very vulnerable situations, just above the international poverty line. Statistics can&apos;t always answer the most interesting questions. How has the global fight against poverty developed over the past 10 years? What role, if any, has aid played? What about the state? What should replace the millennium development goals (MDGs) when they expire in 2015? And with the majority of the world&apos;s poorest people living in middle-income countries, how should aid donors, civil society organisations and other development actors engage with rising inequality within countries? On Sunday 25 March, the Global development team and guests will debate these questions and more at the Guardian&apos;s Open Weekend. For those of you who can&apos;t join us on the day, we&apos;ll be recording the discussion as this month&apos;s Global development podcast. We&apos;ll hear from Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Abhijit Banerjee, who&apos;ll share lessons from the highly-acclaimed book Poor Economics, which he co-wrote with Esther Duflo. We&apos;ll also hear from Jayati Ghosh, economist at Jawaharlal Nehru University and a regular commentator on the Global development site. From the Guardian, we&apos;ll be joined by Global development reporter Mark Tran and health editor Sarah Boseley. Lucy Lamble, the Global development site editor, will chair the discussion. In advance of the debate, we want to know what you think. What would you like to ask the panellists? What do you think are the key issues or cases we should focus on? What comments do you have? Let us know, and help shape both the Open Weekend discussion and this month&apos;s Global development podcast. As always, if you have any problems posting, or if you would prefer to comment anonymously, email us at development@theguardian.com and we&apos;ll add your thoughts.

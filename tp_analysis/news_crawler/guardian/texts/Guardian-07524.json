Nikon D90, 1/1250 sec, f/5.3, 240 mm, iso:400    Question: Despite being widespread throughout much of Europe, this English mystery bird did not originate in the Old World. Where did it originate? How did it get to England? Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is an adult European goldfinch, Carduelis carduelis, a member of the finch family, Fringillidae, which are widespread throughout the northern hemisphere.  Looking at this question now, I am completely mystified as to what I was trying to get at by asking it. So I&apos;ll give smug points to whomever can suss out the meaning of this question, or who can think of the best slapstick comedy routine to regale us all with whilst I headdesk my evening away.

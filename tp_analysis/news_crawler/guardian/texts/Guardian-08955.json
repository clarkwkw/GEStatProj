    "text": "Four years ago this month, the then US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson learned that the British government would not allow Barclays to purchase Lehman Brothers. &quot;They don&apos;t want US problems infecting the UK system,&quot; Paulson said. Days later, Lehman filed for bankruptcy. But, it turns out, we were far from immune. UK GDP will not recover to pre-crisis levels until 2014 at the earliest and we seem to be recovering at a slower pace than other nations. We are still sick. That means we need to look to the parts of our economy that are still healthy, because they will have the cure. Cue the green economy. By 2014, when it&apos;s expected the rest of the economy will be restored to 2007 levels, the green economy will have grown by 40%. The Confederation of British Industry states that one-third of the UK&apos;s economic growth in the last financial year came from green business. They also believe green business could halve our trade deficit by 2014-15. That makes sense, since we already export 330m more green goods and services to China than we import from them. It is an undoubted UK success story, as our recent infographic shows, with strength in jobs, infrastructure spending and international trade. There are plenty of reasons why it has done so well. Most obvious being that climate change doesn&apos;t take a time out for an economic crisis. The impact of extreme weather on supply chains has shown businesses that it&apos;s a good idea to invest in resilience. But there are other reasons. First, the green economy is about doing more with less. A concept that is more appealing now than ever. A second reason is the opportunity it offers for large-scale investment. Greening the economy is a big job, and there is a lot to do. As economist Dimitri Zenghelis argues, investors are not lacking funds, just the certainty they need to spend them. The UK previously set a clear policy direction for a low-carbon future which is why we have started to see the returns. This financial year, 88% of the UK&apos;s top 20 infrastructure projects are low carbon, with only 6% of them reliant on public money. But the government is now stalling. Current infrastructure conversations seem to be framed around doing something, anything, so long as it makes things look busy. More of the same, like gas, airports and roads, rather than taking on the big challenge of what we need to really grow the economy, like fibre optic cables, renewables and low-carbon transport networks. It may be easier to repeat the past, but it won&apos;t help the recovery or give us the tools we need for what is to come. Recently the chancellor made clear that he was willing to risk investment in the new green economy to protract the life old way of doing things. He seems very keen on gas which, even the most optimistic commentators admit , will leave us reliant on imports in a seller&apos;s market. In fact, the Office for National Statistics sees this as key to why we&apos;re still doing so badly. It&apos;s an odd approach: stop the growth of the future to prop up the failures of the past. This is not a growth policy, but a witch trial: if it floats, drown it, if it sinks, invest in it. Business needs to make very clear to the chancellor that the country can&apos;t afford such an approach.",

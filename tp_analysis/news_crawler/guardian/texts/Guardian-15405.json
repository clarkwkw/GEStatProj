    "text": "When I was a university lecturer, a student asked me to double check her exam script that I had marked. A colleague, an experienced senior lecturer, warned me against it. &quot;Don&apos;t look at it&quot;, he said, &quot;or you&apos;ll open the gates of hell&quot;. As a lecturer in ethics, I wanted to do the right thing. I had marked over 300 exams that year and could well have made an error in one of the scripts. So I ignored my colleague&apos;s warning. The student was right  I had added her marks incorrectly, although it made no difference to her grade. But my colleague was right too. To my embarrassment, an external examiner was appointed to check the rest of my exam scripts. Today, tuition fees are higher than ever and so is the number of students appealing their exam results. In its latest report, published in 2012, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA), an independent body that reviews the complaints of students against universities, reported a 20% increase in complaints from the previous year. There were 1,605 complaints, the highest number in the history of the OIA. As students can only use the OIA if they have exhausted the internal complaints procedure, the number of internal academic appeals far exceeds that number. A friend approached me for advice last year. After five years of study, she had failed her PhD. Her university&apos;s rules and regulations were long and complicated. After looking into her case, it emerged that her two examiners had shared their reports with each other before submitting them to the university. This was a gross violation of the regulations, which required each examiner to submit their report individually before any discussion with the other examiner. The purpose of this rule was to maintain the independence of each examiner and to reduce the possibility of one examiner unduly influencing the report of the other. My friend was allowed to resubmit her PhD. After that experience, I realised that many students, even postgraduate students of high academic ability, are ill-equipped to put their case to the university. Facing the prospect of an uncertain future, often burdened by pressure from disappointed relatives, they are psychologically fragile. The appeal process, captured in pages of obscure regulations, is daunting, particularly for those students whose first language is not English. Relevant guidance, forms and documents are scattered in different parts of the university&apos;s website. Student unions vary in the quality of the assistance they provide to students. Too often, the result is an appeal that fails to do justice to the student&apos;s case. Of course, not all students have worthy claims. One student wanted to appeal an exam result because she said the teaching on the course had been poor  the exam took place 14 years ago! It is common for students to allege that they were ill on the day of the exam, or that they were upset because their second cousin, twice removed, had been involved in an accident. Somehow, it is only after the results are published that they mention these problems. As a medical ethicist, a disappointing discovery has been the willingness of some private doctors to write letters for students saying, for example, that the student suffered from depression during the exam period. This can cost as little as 100 to secure. Such deception or exaggeration goes against the tenets of medical ethics. One postgraduate student, who held such a letter, told me: &quot;Professors in this country are very strange. In my country, we speak to the head of department in confidence, give him some money, and that solves the problem. Here, you have to jump through all these hoops. It&apos;s crazy.&quot; These sorts of cases waste everyone&apos;s time but they are wrongly used to argue that all academic appeals are misconceived and that modern day students feel entitled to a good degree. Examiners, like everyone, make mistakes. The proper procedures are not always followed. Students can have valid reasons for performing poorly in exams, and should not suffer from the dubious claims of others. Some students, especially those from cultures that disapprove of questioning authority, are embarrassed about appealing. Yet, there is nothing embarrassing about it. It can be the right, and courageous, thing to do. With the rise in the number of appeals, universities should offer guidance to students who contemplate an appeal. It should be comprehensive, in clear English, easily accessible, and refer to any other relevant university documents. These documents should, in turn, be clear and accessible too. There should be realistic deadlines for appeal. The 10-day limit of some institutions is too short, especially if students need information from the university or a third party, such as doctor or counsellor. One function of a university is to help students appreciate the importance of treating others justly. This should be reflected in the university&apos;s own appeals procedure.

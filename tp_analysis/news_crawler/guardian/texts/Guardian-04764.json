    "text": "Frank Cottrell Boyce is a bewitching storyteller, leading on his delighted audience, whether readers of his books or listeners to his tales, from step to extraordinary step. A favourite at his lectures, talks and school sessions involves the astronomer Tycho Brahe&apos;s pet. It was an elk. A pet elk? It had an accident coming downstairs. It lived upstairs? The trouble was, it was drunk. He drank with it? Yes, and because of a deforming illness he had a false nose made of gold. Jaw-dropping, eye-popping. The TV screenwriter who turned to writing children&apos;s books unfolds the bizarre plot with just the right timing. Kids of all ages are riveted, in the palm of his gently beguiling hand. From this month it is also a professorial hand, since he has been appointed professor of reading at Liverpool Hope University, the first such professorship in the UK, which will involve him teaching trainee teachers, amongst others. Cottrell Boyce was born in Liverpool and grew up in a large, extended, Merseyside Catholic family. He lives there today with his wife in the home where they have brought up their own seven children. The family opted for home-schooling, not through frustration or resentment, but because everyone enjoyed it so much. Drifting in and out with your nose in a book was universal. Not surprising, perhaps, in the household of a writer whose eye for the strange-but-true (Tycho Brahe really did have a golden nose and pet elk) won him the Carnegie Medal in 2004 with his very first effort. That was Millions, with its appealing and ingenious plot of two young brothers who find a million pounds just before the UK converts to the euro. They have to spend it, and fast. Other delightful and hugely popular plots followed: Cosmic, the story of a tall teenager endlessly mistaken for an adult who goes into space  a double play on people caught between two worlds  and Framed, involving a dramatic art theft using genuine detail of the wartime storage of the National Gallery&apos;s treasures in a Welsh slate mine. Cosmic was short-listed for a second Carnegie in 2008, while Framed won the Whitbread children&apos;s book of the year three years earlier. Cottrell Boyce had wanted for ages to spread the gospel of getting people to read for the sheer pleasure of it, pleasure in a deeper sense than distraction from life&apos;s chores and bores or simple fun. He points out that a child&apos;s brain hardwires experiences enjoyed. &quot;Real pleasure makes something stay in your brain for a long time and great things come from that,&quot; he says. &quot;The stories you read when you are 10 or 11, stories that really stay with you because you love them in a profound way, give you maps to read life from.&quot; His own books&apos; success allowed him the time for some overtime missionary work in this field; first with the Reader Organisation (RO), the Liverpool-based charity that encourages &quot;people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities to enjoy and engage with reading&quot;. And now, after giving a course of four lectures to students there last year through contacts at the RO, with Liverpool Hope. Millions started life as a film and it was over a meal with its director, Danny Boyle, that Cottrell Boyce mentioned that he had always wanted to write a children&apos;s book. Why not turn this into one, said Boyle, and the story came flying on to the page when Cottrell Boyce returned home. That proved a useful episode for the talks to children that he gave as part of his work with the RO. &quot;When you talk to a school, you can be sure of three questions: are you famous, how much do you earn, and where do your ideas come from?&quot; he says. &quot;The ones I really like are the completely unpredictable ones. How much do you weigh? Or  Have you ever eaten a nettle?&quot; That sort of ambush could itself trigger a plot. So, for that matter, can the place where Cottrell Boyce was asked it, a school at Adlington near Preston. The mention of Preston and the recent, very rare, opportunity to see the transit of Venus gets him going on Jeremiah Horrocks, his fellow Liverpudlian of the 17th century, who was the first man, along with his collaborator William Crabtree of Salford, to watch and record the little speck of the planet traversing the sun&apos;s face during an almost miraculous gap in the clouds. Horrocks was a clever northern lad, who went to Cambridge. Cottrell Boyce was at Keble College, Oxford, both for his undergraduate degree in English and then a doctorate, writing criticism for various magazines before settling to screenwriting for Brookside and, later, Coronation Street. He wrote, but he also read and read. To an extent, he says, this was stimulated by the &quot;familiar old narrative&quot; of youth discovering the classics of the past, but his bubbling enthusiasm for reading is too vigorous to be satisfied with solitary pleasure. In his talks, he emphasises the pleasure of people reading together: book circles, families queuing to read the latest JK Rowling or similar, school classes passing a book round and taking turns to read out loud. The communal side appeals to him, even after years in the highly competitive media world. He says: &quot;Competition will sharpen a knife, but never make one.&quot; Mutual encouragement, and the sort of teamwork he has experienced in the film world, are the means to increase the pleasure of reading still more. His work with the Reader Organisation convinced him that a generation of teachers was being prepared in a way that marginalised reading&apos;s pleasure. He says: &quot;That was why I wanted to get to Hope and spread the word and get teachers reading again. Sometimes people don&apos;t know what to read; it&apos;s a question of sharing what&apos;s good.&quot; His own pantheon includes the classic work of E Nesbitt and CS Lewis&apos;s Narnia as well as Philip Pullman&apos;s trilogy His Dark Materials and Richmal Crompton&apos;s William stories, of which he is a superfan. And his students are benefiting from that priceless asset in a teacher: one who practises what he preaches. Every day brings experiences to Cottrell Boyce that contain the seeds of storytelling. Some have been used in his work with Danny Boyle on the Olympic Games opening ceremony, for which he has written a storyline based on The Tempest. And then there was Nicole Kidman&apos;s sudden change of heart about the setting of a crucial scene in The Railway Man, a film based on a survivor of the second world war&apos;s Burma railway, which has just gone into production. &quot;I&apos;d done this really moving final scene in Japan where the hero had finally gone in search of reconciliation,&quot; he says. &quot;Then I got a call from the film company saying that Nicole couldn&apos;t get to Japan. We discussed where she could get to, and that&apos;s how it came to end up in Berwick-upon-Tweed.&quot; It makes a perfect ending, better than his original one, he says. And maybe an idea to start another children&apos;s book.

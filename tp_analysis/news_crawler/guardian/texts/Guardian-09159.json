    "text": "The discovery of an ancient temple complex on their land has had a major impact on Orcadians. Many volunteers are local and the excavations&apos; progress is chronicled vividly and in detail on the Orkneyjar website (orkneyjar.com) run by local writer Sigurd Towrie. &quot;We get a lot of tourists, but what is really noticeable is the numbers of local folk who keep coming back,&quot; says discoverer Nick Card. The idea that a 5,000-year-old thread unites the island&apos;s first farming communities with those of today clearly resonates with Orcadians. Card  a compact, sandy-haired figure who patrols the excavations in denims and wellies  has had his life changed. &quot;We only dig here for a short time each year and it is only then that I am happy  when we discover some of the wonders this place possesses. Then my students realise that I am not always the grumpy bastard I appear to be in college.&quot; And of course the Ness is also transformed at this time. The black plastic sheets protecting the temple from Orkney&apos;s relentless year-round storms are pulled back in mid-July to reveal the maze of walls, pathways, altars, shards of sandstone and ditches that were uncovered in previous years. Then the volunteers move in. They will spend the next six weeks on their knees scraping away the black soil of Brodgar, millimetre by millimetre, to uncover fresh glories: slabs of pavement, shards of fine pottery, clay pots the size of thumbs and stone spatulas. During my visit Iwatched Jo Heupel, a student from Willamette University in Oregon  which sends volunteers to Brodgar every year  carefully scrape a perfectly preserved mace head from the sticky mud, her first major find. By contrast, Babette Barthelmess, a retired molecular biologist from Hanover, is aveteran visitor, paying her own way each year to help store and record the finds. &quot;I do it because I love the landscape, the light and the people of Orkney,&quot; she says. Sometimes conditions for these visitors are pleasant, often they are miserable, and occasionally they are downright foul. The day before my visit in August, gales had forced Card to close the site. When Iarrived the winds haddisappeared and been replaced by athick, cloying mist which suffocated sounds and brought a sense of sinister isolation to the place. On the other hand, some developments have been unambiguously welcomed. Last year an American benefactor bought oneof the farmhouses on the Ness and donated it to the dig. &quot;We have a flushing toilet at last,&quot; beamed one volunteer.",

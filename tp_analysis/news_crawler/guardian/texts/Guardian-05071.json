Facebook is still working on deleting photos from its servers in a timely manner nearly three years after Ars first brought attention to the topic. The company admitted on Friday that its older systems for storing uploaded content &quot;did not always delete images from content delivery networks in a reasonable period of time even though they were immediately removed from the site,&quot; but said it&apos;s currently finishing up a newer system that makes the process much quicker. In the meantime, photos that users thought they &quot;deleted&quot; from the social network months or even years ago remain accessible via direct link.  Facebook&apos;s mobility challenge &gt;&gt; New York Times The Financial Times reports that Facebook will introduce mobile ads within weeks  just in time for its Wall Street debut. How China Ate Android &gt;&gt; Forbes If Android isn&apos;t growing in the US, what&apos;s happening elsewhere? It&apos;s exploding in China:   ZTE is now targeting 80 Million handset volume in 2012 - and 100% smartphone volume growth. ZTE Blade became the second-best selling W-CDMA phone in China last summer and is now cruising towards 10 million units sold globally. The ZTE Skate is off to an even faster start. And ZTE is actually behind Huawei in China - these two combined are likely to hit 25% share of China&apos;s handset market by summer. By elbowing out old champs like Motorola and LG in China, Huawei and ZTE are building production scale they can leverage to undercut rivals even more aggressively in the rest of the Asia.   And they&apos;re killing mid-tier operators like HTC, LG, Sony Ericsson and Motorola. For 2012, they&apos;re coming to the US:   It would not be surprising if Google opts to wind down Motorola&apos;s handset operations sometime over the next two years and Sony bails out entirely.   Note that. Motorola wants 2.25% of Apple&apos;s sales in return for license to standard-essential wireless patents &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents Motorola has said it will license its essential patents to Apple, but for what is quite a large slice of revenue. Apple, in response, has put in requests for find out how much Nokia, Qualcomm, HTC, LG and Ericsson are required to pay. If Motorola has trying to screw more money out of Apple for essential (&quot;FRAND&quot;) patents, that may go badly for it. Samsung is accused of the same tactic against Apple, by the way. I switched to Bing on the iPhone and it didn&apos;t kill me &gt;&gt; The Next Web Matt PAnzarino examines whether Apple could dump Google from iOS devices:   Apple is already working on what is, at least judging from acquisitions, a technically superior version of Maps built specifically for iOS devices. But you can&apos;t build a search engine in a day, or even in a couple of years. So the only viable option is to change the default iPhone search engine from Google to Bing. So I decided to take Bing for a spin, changing it to my default search engine for a month or two. What I found was that it actually could be a very solid alternative to Google for a large portion of iPhone users, and that it might even be a better fit for the majority of those than Google is.   However, that&apos;s not really a reflection of what he did find. Bing was good on local but less good on maps, news, gossip and some &quot;geeky&quot; searches. But of course, nobody changes defaults. U.S. government, military to get secure Android phones - CNN.com Bad news for RIM?    Some US officials this year are expected to get smartphones capable of handling classified government documents over cellular networks, according to people involved in the project. The phones will run a modified version of Google&apos;s Android software, which is being developed as part of an initiative that spans multiple federal agencies and government contractors, these people said.   So, another Android fork. It&apos;s not quite a win for Google - more a win for the US government. But for RIM, which has for ages had so much of the US government business, it&apos;s not good news.

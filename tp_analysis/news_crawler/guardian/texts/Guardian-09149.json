    "text": "The explosion of smartphone titles such as Flick Kick Football and New Star Soccer have made football games more accessible than ever, opening the genre to audiences likely to balk at the convoluted menus and realistic gameplay of Fifa. But for the full football experience, it is the latter that remains the best title on offer, and this year&apos;s edition maintains thepedigree. Fifa 13 offers a big step forward over its predecessor, with player stats that now reflect their real-life counterparts, vastly improved dribbling, better team-mate AI, and commentary that includes touchline reports and score updates. There&apos;s also a new score-based challenge mode, Skill Games, which is almost as addictive as the aforementioned smartphone titles. But the biggest change involves ball control. Players can no longer expect near-perfect first touches, and poor passes to average players may result in loss of control. It can be frustrating, but it also adds unpredictability and excitement to the gameplay. Fifa 13&apos;s depth and realism make it a more difficult title to pick up and play than its handheld rivals, but given time even players who may initially find its complexity daunting will discover one of the finest sports titles ever made.",

    "text": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Verizon: Half of our first-quarter smartphone sales were iPhones &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  Apple&apos;s iPhone continues to sell well at Verizon, though not quite as well as last quarter. Reporting first-quarter earnings largely in line with expectations this morning, Verizon said it sold 6.3m smartphones. Of those, 3.2m were iPhones.   This is quite surprising, isn&apos;t it? What would be really useful would be knowing what proportion of smartphone sales go to new customers, and what proportion are purchases by existing smartphone users (and of what platform). Also: Verizon sold 2.1m LTE-enabled smartphones, 1m less than the still-3G iPhone. ISPs Have to Identify Alleged Pirates, EU Court Rules &gt;&gt; TorrentFreak  A dispute over whether a Swedish ISP can be forced to hand over the details of one its subscribers to an anti-piracy group has just received its long-awaited ruling from the Europe&apos;s highest court. A few moments ago the European Court of Justice announced that there are no EU barriers which prevent the ISP handing over its customers&apos; private details to copyright holders.  My comments on Windows Phone - Life as a Developer Evangelist &gt;&gt; MSDN Blogs Nuno Silva:   I recently participated in an interview with the Portuguese website Zwame, where I made some comments on the future of Windows Phone that created confusion. Rumors are swirling, so I feel the need to clarify my statements.  The point I was attempting to make was simply that existing Windows Phone applications will run on the next version of Windows Phone. This is the same guidance that Microsoft shared late last year.  I mistakenly confused app compatibility with phone updateability, which caused the rumors we saw yesterday. I did not intend to give the impression I was offering new guidance on any products under development or their upgradeability.   Microsoft is being cagey about whether current phones running Windows Phone 7 or Windows Phone 7.5 will be able to run Windows Phone 8 when it comes out later this year. Either it hasn&apos;t decided or it doesn&apos;t want to break the bad news. More important question: does it matter? The anatomy of Flashfake. Part 1 &gt;&gt; Securelist How all those Macs got infected:   The partner program was based on script redirects from huge numbers of legitimate websites all over the world. Around the end of February/early March 2012, tens of thousands of sites powered by WordPress were compromised. How this happened is unclear. The main theories are that bloggers were using vulnerable versions of WordPress or they had installed the ToolsPack plugin. Websense put the number of affected sites at 30,000 , while other companies say the figure could be as high as 100,000. Approximately 85% of the compromised blogs are located in the US.  Code was injected into the main pages when the blogs were hacked. As a result, when any of the compromised sites were visited, a partner program TDS was contacted. Depending on the operating system and browser version, the browser then performed a hidden redirect to sites in the rr.nu domain zone that had the appropriate set of exploits installed on them to carry out an infection.  Apple marketing SVP Phil Schiller dumps Instagram over expansion to Android &gt;&gt; 9to5Mac  Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is not the only photo-loving business executive upset by Instagram in recent weeks. While Dorsey stopped posting photos from his Instagram after Facebook reportedly beat his Twitter to an acquisition of Instagram, Apple Senior Vice President quit his Instagram for another reason: Android.   And a week or two later they sold for a billion dollars. Some shark. Some jump. Who Is Tim Lindholm? Google&apos;s CEO is wondering that too &gt;&gt; WSJ Digits Blog  Google has fought to keep the email out of the trial taking place now in San Francisco, to no avail. During his testimony earlier this week, Mr. Page said he couldn&apos;t recall the email, or providing such directions to Mr. Lindholm, or even for that matter the identity of Mr. Lindholm.  So, who is Tim Lindholm?   Likely to be called this week. Does the internet breed killers? &gt;&gt; CNN.com Terrible headline on a more interesting piece by Andrew Keen (described as a &quot;professional sceptic&quot;. They never mentioned that at the careers office.) The kernel of this argument is this:   Narcissism, of course, wasn&apos;t invented by the Internet and it would be absurd to establish a causal connection between self-love and mass murder. That said, however, today&apos;s digital media culture - which shatters the 20th century mass audience into billions of 21st century authors and enables them all to broadcast their most intimate thoughts to the world - seems to be making narcissism the default mode of contemporary existence.  Supporting copyright is not the same as opposing freedom of speech &gt;&gt; guardian.co.uk (Musician) Helienne Lindvall:   I was told to prepare a five-minute speech, so apart from speaking of the reality musicians are facing, I spent days reading the actual [ACTA] agreement, different points of views on it, as well as looking into the different issues it deals with, to make sure I knew what was being discussed. I&apos;d heard from the Pirate Party as well as some other action groups that it would impede freedom of speech so naturally I was concerned - after all, musicians rely on freedom of expression, as do journalists. I was surprised to find that Acta would do nothing of the sort. In fact, it wouldn&apos;t change any existent laws in the EU.  It soon became clear that my preparations were in vain.  Oracle v. Google trial &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents Amidst his analysis of the first days of the Oracle-Google trial, Florian Mller adds:   As an independent analyst and blogger, I will express only my own opinions, which cannot be attributed to any one of my diversity of clients. I often say things none of them would agree with. That said, as a believer in transparency I would like to inform you that Oracle has very recently become a consulting client of mine. We intend to work together for the long haul on mostly competition-related topics including, for one example, FRAND licensing terms.  We&apos;ve known each other ever since I vocally opposed Oracle&apos;s acquisition of Sun Microsystems (not because of Java), but that&apos;s history as I fully respect the European Commission&apos;s clearance decision and the subsequent closing of the deal.   This will make him even more of a hate figure in Groklaw&apos;s comment threads, if that is possible. (People there won&apos;t admit to having read his blog, won&apos;t link to it, but denounce everything he does.) Mller has reckoned from the start that Google has a copyright infringement case to answer. Groklaw reckons Larry Ellison has a tail and smells of sulphur, and that Google walks on water and smells of roses. Either way, it&apos;s up to the jury now.

    "text": "This month&apos;s Global development podcast looks ahead to the Rio+20 talks and asks what they may mean for sustainable development. The discussion looks back 20 years to see where this all began, explores arguments for a &quot;green economy&quot; (a key conference theme) and the role of business in sustainable development, and considers what is at stake for the People&apos;s summit. To debate these issues, John Vidal is joined in the studio by Claire Melamed, the head of the growth and equity programme at the ODI, a thinktank on international development and humanitarian issues; Hannah Stoddart, head of economic justice policy at NGO Oxfam and Andrew Raingold, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, an alliance of leaders from business, politics and society working for a sustainable economy. Joining the podcast on the telephone are Anil Naidoo from the council of Canadians and co-facilitator of the water thematic group at the People&apos;s summit, and Saleemul Huq, senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development. Join the debate: Rio+20.",

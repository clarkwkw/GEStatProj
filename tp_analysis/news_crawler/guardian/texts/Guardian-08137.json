    "text": "Ministers and universities have joined forces to help legitimate students affected by London Metropolitan University being stripped of its powers to teach and recruit students from outside the European Union. London Met&apos;s vice-chancellor said the action threatened the UK university &quot;brand&quot;, but the UK Border Agency insisted that problems over the enforcement of visa rules lay with one university, not the whole sector. The government and university chiefs have begun trying to help up to 2,700 students from abroad affected by the UKBA ruling which means London Met is no longer able to teach even its current international students. It is the first UK university to be stripped of this licence. Those affected need to find alternative courses elsewhere and get new visas within 60 days of receiving &quot;curtailment letters&quot;, or leave Britain voluntarily. Otherwise they will be removed from the country. The Home Office clarified that the 60-day deadline would only begin once the letters had been delivered to individual students. The Guardian understands it could be weeks before the notices, which are a legal necessity, are sent out in order to give genuine students more time to relocate. The government has also set up a taskforce consisting of the UKBA, the Department of Business, Universities UK, the higher education funding body HEFCE, and the National Union of Students to deal with the situation. It is expected to have its first meeting on Friday to attempt to go through every London Met international student file to identify legitimate cases and help them enrol at other universities. About 290,000 students and dependent visas are issued by the UKBA each year, and 110,000 extensions to such visas. Malcolm Gillies, London Met&apos;s head, said the loss of its ability to authorise visas &quot;sends a fear through many universities in a way that I think is going to be detrimental to their confidence as higher education institutions, but also the projection of brand UK abroad.&quot; He said responses from other universities included &quot;commiseration, worry, anger, but also a feeling of probably, &apos;well thank God it wasn&apos;t us this time&apos;. I think that shows the nervousness that many in the sector have, especially at a time when clearly government policy is changing but also when the [UKBA] guidelines have been changing very rapidly.&quot; Gillies has warned that the future of the university, which has 30,000 students, is at risk because the punishment for its immigration failures will leave a 30m hole in its annual budget, a fifth of the total. The UK&apos;s lucrative higher education business in teaching international students involves about 300,000 students and is worth an estimated 5bn a year to the economy. About 500 private higher education colleges have already lost their power to recruit abroad following crackdowns on bogus students. The immigration minister Damian Green said London Met had displayed a &quot;serious systemic failure&quot; to know whether its students had the right to be in the UK. He denied making the university a political football over immigration controls and insisted such action would not be replicated across the university sector. Green said people entering Britain as students but seeking work exploited one of the biggest loopholes in the immigration system. UKBA audits of London Met found that more than a quarter of cases sampled had no leave to remain in Britain. There was also no proof that a significant proportion of international students had satisfactory English. In more than half of the cases the university did not know whether students were attending lectures. Green said &quot;any of these three breaches would be serious&quot; and that it was important to ensure &quot;not just private colleges but universities obey the law&quot;. &quot;What we found here is a serious systemic failure where it appears that the university doesn&apos;t have the capacity to be a proper sponsor [of international students] and to have confidence that the students have the right to be here in the first place,&quot; Green said. University funders and leaders said the first priority was to sort out the future of genuine students. It is understood the HEFCE and London Met have been in talks for weeks over the crisis, which began when the UKBA suspended the university&apos;s right to be a &quot;highly trusted sponsor&quot; of students on 16 July. Professor Eric Thomas, the president of Universities UK, said the organisation was committed to eliminating any abuse of the student visa system, but there were alternative ways to address UKBA&apos;s concerns and revocation of a university&apos;s licence should only be a last resort. &quot;We will be working with UKBA to ensure that compliance issues can be addressed in a more constructive way in the future,&quot; Thomas said. Syed Rumman, vice-president for education for London Met&apos;s student union, accused the government of &quot;chucking students&apos; lives into the bin&quot;. Liam Burns, president of the NUS, said: &quot;It is disgusting that international students continue to be used as a political football by politicians who seem either incapable of understanding, or are simply uncaring about the impact of their decisions on individuals, universities and the UK economy. &quot;This decision will create panic and potential heartbreak for students not just at London Met but also all around the country.&quot; The UKBA said it been working with London Met to put right shortcomings since March, the same month the National Audit Office issued withering criticism of the agency&apos;s performance for taking &quot;little action&quot; in enforcing immigration rules for students. It said that in the first year after introducing the current system that licenses schools, colleges and universities to sponsor students in 2009, up to 50,000 students were thought to have entered Britain to work rather than study. Between February 2010 and October 2011 sponsoring institutions made 62,000 notifications to the agency that students were not attending college. The agency did not know how many students had left after their leave to remain had expired, although 2,700 students and overstayers had been removed from 1 April 2009. MPs on the Commons public accounts committee will be reporting on the same issue on Tuesday, although the London Met crisis came too late for them to include it in their verdict on whether matters have improved in recent months. London Met has set up a helpline for worried students  +44 (0)20 7133 4141  and the UKBA has posted advice for students online.",

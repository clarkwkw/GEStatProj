Image: Alex Vargas, 5 March 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise].

Question: This Thai mystery bird is one of several species in the world that is most eagerly sought after by bird watchers. Why? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Is this a male or female? Response: This is an adult male Gurney&apos;s pitta, Pitta gurneyi, an endangered species that was believed to be extinct until several pairs were rediscovered in 1986. At that time, it was thought to be the rarest bird species on earth. Currently, it is estimated that there are perhaps 10 pairs of Gurney&apos;s pittas at Khao Nor Chuchi in Thailand (other Thai populations are probably extinct). Fortunately, another, larger, population was recently discovered in southern Tenasserim, Myanmar/Burma. For this reason, this species was downlisted as endangered.  Gurney&apos;s pitta is a terrestrial passerine that lives in lowland semi-evergreen forests with undergrowth containing Salacca palms, where it nests. These moist tropical forests are found on flat terrain, and are close to water or have water flowing through them. Tragically, their forest&apos;s topological features and location are perfect for palm oil, rubber, and coffee plantations. Much of the remaining nearby area is heavily settled. Since the locals are actively seeking ways to improve the quality of their lives by exploiting the land for economic gain, it is probable that the pitta&apos;s last few strongholds will be cleared suddenly and rapidly, with predictable consequences for this iconic species.  Gurney&apos;s pitta is impossible to confuse with any other species in the area. The adult male&apos;s iridescent blue cap and tail, warm rufous upperparts and black-and-yellow underparts are distinctive. The female is less dramatically coloured, lacking the brilliant iridescent blue cap and tail. She has a buffy-yellow head and nape, the sides of her head are black, her throat is buffy-white, her underparts are buffy-yellow with darker bars and her tail is grey-blue. Thanks to the people who freely contribute their work for public enjoyment at Xeno-canto, here&apos;s a 1:04-minute mp3 recording of a calling Gurney&apos;s pitta, recorded in Khao Noi Chuchi in Krabi, Thailand on 10 April 2002:       Recordist: Arnold Meijer.  Gurney&apos;s pitta consumes slugs, insects, and earthworms, which is searches for in leaf litter. They also eat snails and small frogs. Here&apos;s a video of an adult male Gurney&apos;s pitta poking around in leaf litter in Khao Noi Chuchi in Krabi, Thailand:             Visit birdingetc&apos;s YouTube channel [video link]. The videographer says he turned off the sound due to all the whispering from his fellow birders and the clatter from their cameras, video equipment, etc.  If you would like to read more about one birder&apos;s quest to see and photograph all the world&apos;s pitta species, then you&apos;ll enjoy The Jewel Hunter (read my review here).  Gurney&apos;s pitta is one of 32 medium-sized songbirds that is placed into Pittidae, the pitta family. The pittas are all very similar in body shape, size and in their habits, although each species is distinctly marked. The family originated in tropical Asia and Australasia, and a few species are found in Africa. The continued existence of many pitta species is threatened by deforestation.

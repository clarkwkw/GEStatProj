    "text": "    This week&apos;s element is radon, which has the chemical symbol Rn and the atomic number 86. Radon is the largest and heaviest of the noble gases that are known to exist, and thus, it&apos;s the last one we will meet. Radon&apos;s name is derived from radium, a radioactive element that emits radon as it decays. For this reason, radon was originally known as &quot;radium emanation&quot;, although it was also known as thoron (&quot;thorium emanation&quot;) and actinon (&quot;actinium emanation&quot;) since it was also emitted by these elements. In 1912, the name, niton (derived from Latin for &quot;shining&quot; in recognition of its radioluminosity), with the chemical symbol, Nt, was approved as the name for radon. This name was formally changed to radon in 1923 after it was realised that thoron and actinon were also radioisotopes of the same nobel gas. Like the other noble gases, radon is colourless, odourless and tasteless. Chemically speaking, radon is rather boring since its outer (valence) shell electrons are tightly held, which means it is not very reactive. However, since it is the largest of the noble gases, its valence electrons are not held as tightly as those of its smaller and lighter sister elements, so it can be chemically attacked by powerful oxidizing elements such as fluorine and oxygen.  Radon has 36 known radioisotopes, with half-lives ranging from 3.8 days to just milliseconds. Although radon is very rare on Earth, with a total accumulation in the atmosphere that is estimated to be less than 100 grams at any one time, it is produced continuously by the radioactive decay of radium-226. This element is found in uranium ores as well as in a wide variety of igneous, metamorphic or common rocks. Since radon is emitted by so many sorts of rock, it accumulates in the basements and attics of houses. However, its presence is easily reduced through the use of proper ventilation methods.  Radon is both gaseous and radioactive, so it poses a danger to public health. In fact, it is recognised by the World Health Organisation and the United States Environmental Protection Agency as the second leading cause of lung cancer in smokers -- and the leading cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers (WHO PDF; also read this). For this reason, it is important to test one&apos;s home for the presence of radon.  Unlike other noble gases, radon is interesting to biologists because it may have played a role in the evolution of life on Earth: it is a significant contributor to the natural background radiation on this planet, so it may be a major source of genetic mutations that in turn, drive the evolution of life.  Here&apos;s our favourite chemistry professor, telling us a little more about radon:            [video link] This is the NEW video, just released, about radon. Once again, this video features our favourite chemistry professor, but this time, he is at the Royal Society&apos;s archives, where he shows us historical letters and photographs documenting the discovery of radon. He also visits a cloud chamber in Germany where Brady Haran captures the very beautiful decay of radon-220 on film:            [video link, NOTE: this film was added 26 March 2013] .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

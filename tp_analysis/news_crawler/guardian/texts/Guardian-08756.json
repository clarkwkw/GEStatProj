    "text": "Nick Clegg&apos;s apology has done little to redeem his party&apos;s reputation among students, according to an NUS survey of 25,000 students. Just one in 10 students (11.1%) say they are more likely to vote Lib Dem after the deputy prime minister said sorry for promising not to increase tuition fees before the last election. When asked which political party they would to vote for, one in 13 (7.7%) said they would back the Lib Dems, making them less popular than Labour (37.9%), Conservatives (16.8%) and the Green party (8.0%). NUS president Liam Burns was unsurprised by the findings, adding that students felt betrayed by Clegg&apos;s decision to renegade on his promise not to vote for a tuition fee rise. &quot;Nick Clegg actually won students&apos; votes by signing the pledge. It is clear he has lost them by breaking it. This attempted apology has created more confusion than clarity. Mr Clegg must now make amends by changing his policies.&quot; In the runup to the 2010 general election the Lib Dems targeted university campuses with their campaign to abolish fees, while Clegg and his MPs signed the NUS pledge not to vote for a rise. Burns backed comments made Lib Dem party president Tim Farron that the party &quot;should have fought harder&quot; to keep its promise and called on Clegg to change his policies. &quot;He and those of his colleagues who voted for a rise in tuition fees should not be apologising for making a pledge which reinforced the Liberal Democrats long standing and fully costed proposal to abolish tuition fees.&quot;",

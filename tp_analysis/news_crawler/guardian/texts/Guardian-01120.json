    "text": "Once you&apos;ve mastered the art of networking, got the balance right between publishing and developing teaching skills, found a mentor and started a blog, you then need to find a post-doc position and for many, navigating life after a PhD proves more challenging that getting the PhD in the first place. Last year, in a our Life after PhD live chat, this comment by UnstoppableSteve, seemed to sum up the job struggles and confusion of many post-docs: &quot;The hiring practices in academia are considerably more bizarre than in many fields, relying much more on &apos;the old boys&apos; network&apos;, sneaky deals and outright bizarre and unjustified decision-making. Academics are almost given too much freedom in the hiring and firing without having to justify their decisions. Do you feel academia would benefit from a more level playing field for new post-doc candidates?&quot;  So what are your options after submitting your viva? How will a career trajectory in the sciences differ from the arts? And how can you improve your chances of securing that prized post-doc position? If you want to know the answers to these questions, have other career-related thoughts, need to vent about the challenges or share advice you&apos;ve found useful, join our panel on Friday 27 January. The live chat will run from 4pm to 6pm GMT. You can post questions below now and also on Twitter, using the #HElivechat hashtag This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

    "text": "     My second child is due in March, and I would love to be able to document his development by regularly (at least once a week over a number years) photographing his face. Ultimately, I want to be able to play back a film of his growth by stitching together all those shots. Ideally, I&apos;d like to be able to use either my Canon G12 or my iPhone 4S (although both devices are likely to be upgraded in time) to supply JPegs for the project. I&apos;m rather hoping someone has developed something I can use across both platforms of iOS and a PC.Darran FletcherMost of the programs developed to show a child&apos;s development are baby albums-cum-digital diaries such as Virtualsoft&apos;s Baby Album and Posthaste&apos;s Baby&apos;s Keepsake Album. You&apos;re really creating a time-lapse video with an unusually long interval between the different frames. A search for time-lapse software should help you find something that will do the job. Free examples include PhotoLapse 3 and JPGvideo for Windows, and Time Lapse Assembler 1.5.1 for Mac OS X. Google&apos;s Picasa is another free option. Apple&apos;s QuickTime Pro can do it too, though it&apos;s frankly not worth 20. In fact, you may already have a more powerful and more versatile program that will create a time-lapse video. Microsoft&apos;s Windows Movie Maker and Apple&apos;s iMovie are the most common examples, but you can use any video editing program that can import jpg, png, bmp or similar images. I haven&apos;t checked, but I assume that&apos;s most of them. Tucows has an article, How To Make A Time-Lapse Video, that runs through the process using Windows Movie Maker, but they all work in much the same way. Free, open source alternatives for Windows include Virtual Dub and Avidemux (which has nothing to do with the more famous Avid). Avidemux is also available for Linux, BSD Unix and Mac OS X. If you are more serious about video editing, then of course there are lots of commercial programs, including Avid Studio and Sony&apos;s Vegas Movie Studio, which is certainly worth 19.25. Obviously you will get a more fluid, movie-like effect if all your pictures are very similar: taken at the same distance, with the same lighting and background. This will be hard to achieve. It makes a good case for using the same camera throughout, rather than trying to mix Canon G12 and iPhone pictures. It might be worth dedicating a cheap compact camera to the job. If you&apos;re going to reduce all the images to 1280 x 720 pixels (0.9 megapixels) or even 640 x 480 pixels (0.3MP) for DVD then you don&apos;t need high quality 10MP originals from a Canon G12. With a dedicated compact camera, you could draw a letterbox shape on the display screen to provide a frame for your child&apos;s eyes. A Chinagraph pencil or other wax product will probably do the job, though it wipes off. Make marks that will enable you to get reasonably consistent results over many months, though you may have to adjust some images to get the eyes in the same place on each frame. After that, many graphics programs, including Irfan View for Windows, have a batch-processing option that will convert all your snaps to the format you want to import into your movie program. You can cheat a bit. For example, if you want some particularly good shots to stay on screen longer, you can duplicate those images a few times. As long as the final images are all numbered in sequence, the movie program won&apos;t care. If you are about to embark on a 20-year project, it&apos;s worth running a little test first to see how it works out with different frame rates and so on. You could also try shooting short movie sequences instead of still images. I really like Christoph Rehage&apos;s YouTube video, Guy Walks Across China and Grows a Beard, where the background changes in each shot, but not 30 times per second. That might give you a few more ideas. Another option is to use a much smaller number of high-quality pictures and &quot;morph&quot; between them. A good example on YouTube is Infant Girl to Young Woman - Age Progression Morph. It still helps a lot to have consistent head positioning and to make the eyes coincide -- which you can do at the editing stage -- but it is much more forgiving process. (For potential problems, see Morph of woman ages 2 to 52.) If you take this route, you will probably need some morphing software. Examples for Windows include DebugMode&apos;s WinMorph (good and free), or Abrosoft&apos;s FantaMorph 5 ($29.95 but &quot;try before you buy&quot;). Norkross MorphX ($1.99) is a cheap example for Mac OS X. Morpheus Photo Morpher v3.01 Standard ($29.95) is available for both platforms. A web search will turn up several more. People usually set this kind of sequence to a popular song. However, if you want to include your child&apos;s spoken words or any ambient sounds, remember to record them at the time.",

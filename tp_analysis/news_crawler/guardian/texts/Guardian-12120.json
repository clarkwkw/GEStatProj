    "headline": "Do women academics really publish less than men?", 
    "text": "Traditional images of the scholar hark back to the 17th century when solitary male academics beavered away in darkened rooms surrounded by piles of books. As I sit in my office, stuck in front of my computer but surrounded by printed journal articles, I wonder whether much has changed. The pressures on modern day academics still require us to work long hours, often alone, and churn out endless written documents to prove our worth. The well-rehearsed mantra, &apos;publish or perish&apos;, remains as relevant as ever, as long as articles or book chapters pave the way to institutional and academic recognition for our efforts. The forthcoming Research Excellence Framework (REF) is criticised for prioritising these activities and fostering a competitive and individualistic culture among academics. While I question the utility of this exercise, I still find myself working frantically to ensure that I submit, and hopefully publish, a sufficient number of papers to meet the eligibility criteria. A quick look online, however, sugggests not all researchers are isolating themselves from the world for the sake of academic churn. It seems that there are other ways of working. Whether tweeting, blogging or podcasting, academics are using all forms of social and multimedia to connect with a wider community, to foster debate and to disseminate findings. Research  both carrying out and communicating it  is becoming an increasingly collaborative affair. Recent decades have witnessed a definite trend towards collaborative authorship in almost all scientific disciplines and levels of co-authorship within my own field, the social sciences, have risen steadily too, with fewer published articles written by only one author. Perhaps the solitary scholar is a figure of the past. One argument suggests the increasing prominence of women in higher education may partly explain the changing nature of academia. Women and feminine styles of working, it is argued, recognise the importance of collaboration and more innovative ways of communicating research. Such practices challenge the individualist and competitive culture of higher education, and the standard practices of publishing research. If this is the case, these alternative practices may help to explain why, in some situations, women are publishing less than men. Is there any evidence to support the argument that women are more collaborative than men? In a small research study, I examined a random sample of social science journal articles to compare the writing practices of men and women. My analysis found that, across the social sciences, women were actually more collaborative than men. Women contributed to a higher proportion of co-authored articles than their male colleagues. And though only constituting 40% of academics in social science in the UK (at the time of analysis), women contributed to 55% of co-authored papers. It follows, therefore, that women were not writing as many sole author articles as we might expect them to. My analysis also suggested that gender influenced the team make-up: women were more likely to co-author with other women and men wrote with other men. This analysis suggests that women academics are embracing collaborative publication practices. The wider literature also reveals a wider interest in women&apos;s collaborative working styles in higher education. Other studies show that, for some female academics, a sense of connection is situated at the heart of knowledge production and that collaboration enables female scholars to better understand higher education and their place within the academy . With REF 2014 fast approaching, I am left wondering whether such collaborative efforts (and women&apos;s role in them) will be adequately recognised and rewarded by the assessment process. While there are procedures in place to recognise co-authored articles and collaborative work in the REF, it seems somewhat ironic that collaborative pieces can only be submitted by one author. At least those authors will be able to draw on their collaborative and negotiation skills to decide who can enter the published work.

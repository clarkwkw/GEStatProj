    "text": "Fire climates  places with little rainfall, lots of wind and long spells when it is hot and dry  are perfect for some species. Woodland giants like the sequoias of the west coast of North America release seed when their cones are heated to temperatures that only fire can reach. A lodgepole pine may hold its cones for half a century until the right conflagration comes along. Big trees like firs, spruces and sequoias that live for 1,000 years or more can be extraordinarily resilient to heat and flame. When a forest fire reaches the canopy, gases burn at around 1000C. In such a life span, an individual tree might survive several so-called &quot;century fires&quot; (confusingly these great fires occur every 200-300 years). Forest fires are also part of the cycle of pioneering microbial life forms and fire beetles  the latter have fire detectors hundreds of times more sensitive than the kind installed in our homes  rush to fires when they sense them. We can marvel at the brilliance of life that can adapt to thrive in such astonishing ways, while acknowledging the odd vulnerability to a changing climate of our own species. For good reason, the Coast Salish people of the Pacific Rim lived in fear of forest fires. The fires were embodied in some of their most terrifying spirits and gods. Neither they nor myriad animals of the woods could survive a century fire. Escape, if possible, was the only solution. Yet the way that great fires spread once established makes escape unpredictable at best. Burning missiles from the main fire shoot out to create satellite fires. These then combine into one immense, furious furnace. Great areas ignite spontaneously at a certain tipping point, the temperature for the combustion of plant matter. At a much greater scale, with global warming, we now risk triggering a sequence of system-shifting events. Think of this more as an &quot;aeon fire&quot; than a century fire, in which we default to an unpredictable new, more hostile climate, very different to that in which human civilisation evolved. It will take millennia to shift back to a more convivial world, if indeed such a reversal ever occurs. What informs the optimism of some, and perhaps the complacency of others, is that like life in general, we are incredibly innovative. There&apos;s an assumption that whatever happens, we&apos;ll sort things out. But now, having adapted to one climate with all its weather-related slings and arrows, we&apos;re going beyond its cycle of normal variation. If we don&apos;t stay on the right side of the combustion point for irreversible warming effects, we don&apos;t know if, or in what shape human civilisation will continue. One reason for the success of trees, point out the American conservationists David Suzuki and Wayne Grady, is their collective nature: &quot;No tree is an island; it is a communal citizen and derives  benefits from cooperation, sharing, and mutual effort.&quot; The tiny, purposeful hummingbird can be seen all around the forests of the northern Pacific Rim. Its industry was noted by First Nation people who passed on this story.  &quot;A fire had begun in the forest and was in danger of raging out of control. Terrified, many of the animals fled before it took over. But the hummingbird flew to the nearest water, collected a droplet and flew back to the fire dropping the water onto it. As she flew back and forth to protect her habitat, first the bear, and then the owl, the snake and cougar each called out: &apos;Bird, what are you doing?&apos; The hummingbird answered them all in the same way: &apos;I am doing what I can&apos;.&quot;  Next month is the halfway point in our countdown to when the odds shift against us in the likelihood of staying on the right side of the climate threshold. To celebrate optimism and &quot;doing what I can&quot;, we will mark it by publishing some of the best ideas for change that were submitted through this column to the Guardian, and examples of specially commissioned articles from people who lead their own fields and are changing their own lives. A special event jointly organised by onehundredmonths.org, the New Economics Foundation, 5x15 and the Guardian will also be held at the Royal Festival Hall on 1 October.  www.onehundredmonths.org",

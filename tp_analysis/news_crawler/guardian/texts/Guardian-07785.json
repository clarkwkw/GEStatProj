    "text": "My thanks to Carl Lygo for the name-check (Outsourcing services allows academics to concentrate on what they do best, Education, 20 August). However, he identifies me as a distinguished academic in fine art. I am rather, an art historian, with a career-long commitment to leadership and management in higher education and, as such, I have serious concerns about the challenges we face. My own institution&apos;s response has been to radically focus our management and reduce the number of courses we offer so we can improve both the student and staff experience. Fewer courses accounts for about 14% of the reduction in student applications to UCA. This leaves UCA with a 16% total reduction in applications this year in real terms, the national average for art and design courses. This is a worrying figure for all of us committed to creative arts education and its overwhelmingly positive impact on theUK economy. The situation will require a carefully calibrated response, particularly from specialist institutions like UCA, which have little opportunity of cross-subsidising courses. I doubt outsourcing will be the answer. It appears as though everyone wants to provide, rather than buy services, and there has been too little consideration of some of the disastrous and costly unintended consequences of outsourcing in other public services  the cleaning of hospitals being one example. Many of the functions Lygo suggests are extraneous to the core business of the university are actually critical in terms of ensuring the staff and student experience. In my opinion, the cost of monitoring outsourced services is grossly underestimated and what looks now like a potential gain in terms of savings and focus could be quite the opposite.Dr Simon Ofield-KerrVice-chancellor, University for the Creative Arts",

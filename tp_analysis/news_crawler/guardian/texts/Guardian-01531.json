    "text": "Sunlight illuminates the Scots pines on the lakeshore below Haystacks. It&apos;s a warming touch with much of the country elsewhere affected by snow. Here in Buttermere the morning is spring-like, with the bright trunks setting off the sombre wall of Scarth Gap Pass reaching up behind. This is the sunless side of Haystacks and it is only around midsummer in the early morning light that these flanks look radiant, with the red door of whitewashed Char Cottage below adding charm. It is a panorama that David Hockney, now exhibiting his tree paintings in the Royal Academy, might consider; JMW Turner painted adjacent scenes on his Cumberland tour in the 1700s. Scarth Gap is the weakness where the ridge above  that forms such an impenetrable barrier between the rifts of Buttermere and Ennerdale  can be breached, allowing access from one dale to the next. Snow dusts the tops like icing sugar, yet the pass is seen to be clear as it rakes a diagonal line upwards below an icy High Crag. What an exalted place this is, recognised as such by shepherd Willie Richardson of nearby Gatescarth farm. It was also seen as unique by a previous farm owner, Sir Claude Elliott, former provost of Eton College, who came to live here on retirement. In 1963 he offered &quot;Gaskitt&quot; for 11,000 to Willie&apos;s father, Thomas. The deal was done. Sir Claude&apos;s garden gate was only yards from these glorious pines. Many mornings he walked by to fetch milk from the farm and talk with Thomas. His father, Jeremiah, had moved the family from Watendlath over Honister Pass in 1932, with the help of a grocer&apos;s wagon hired for the day and driving his flock on foot. Thomas always held the only clothes he then owned were the ones he stood up in on that special day.",

    "text": "Whenever I see a young cuckoo in the nest I am surprised that its foster-parents will have anything to do with it. We found one which more than filled the nest of a meadow pipit, and the owners of the nest (and of an incubated egg which lay outside) were working hard to supply its needs. By no stretch of the imagination could they deceive themselves into thinking that it was an overgrown pipit. When touched it puffed out its feathers and pecked savagely; it looked a perfect little fiend. This bird was in Anglesey, and a lady in the same island writes to ask if it is usual to see cuckoos near houses; every morning one perches on flagstaff near her window and calls from 3 a.m. onwards. There are so many cuckoos in Anglesey that one cannot get away from them, but as a matter of fact cuckoos do not shun houses in country places. When they frequent gardens they are most useful birds, for they will eat certain caterpillars which other birds will not touch.",

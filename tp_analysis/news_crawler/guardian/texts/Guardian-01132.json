    "text": "     What better way to celebrate the impending launch of SoulCalibur V than with a huge piece of street art? Thinking very much along these lines, Namco has commissioned graffiti artist Jim Rockwell to create a 16m mural depicting characters from the game. The publisher has just released an interesting time-lapse video to show how it was created.  Rockwell, from aerosol art group ENDoftheLINE, took three days to complete the piece, which will become part of the collective&apos;s Great Eastern Wall art project, which is spread out through... well, Shoreditch, of course. Familiar Soul Calibur veteran Nightmare is depicted alongside newcomer Patroklos and guest star Ezio Auditore from Assassin&apos;s Creed.  Naturally, this is not the first time London has played host to artistic video game marketing ploys. Two years ago, Capcom set up a Monster Hunter drop-in house in the West End, which was covered in artwork depicting the cult RPG title; and to mark the launch of Halo Reach, design agency ConceptArts painted a huge mural onto the side of the Westfield shopping centre. I&apos;m not sure about the end result of the Soul Calibur V project, but the video gives an intriguing glimpse into the intricate techniques used by Rockwell and his collaborators.  SoulCalibur V is hitting PS3 and Xbox 360 on 3 February.",

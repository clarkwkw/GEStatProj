    "text": "As one of the 22 participating organisations mentioned in your article (M&amp;S and Tesco missing from green deal list, 4 April), we would like to reinforce our support for the green deal, along with the other early participants who represent &quot;the business end&quot; of the construction industry. As a leading builders&apos; and plumbers&apos; merchant, Grafton Group has made the first move because we are closely allied to both the SME installers and product manufacturers, so are ideally placed to kickstart the industry. This is the first tranche of businesses that have signed an agreement with the Department of Energy and Climate Change to become green deal providers and we are the forerunners to the high-street groups. It is vital that the commercial framework, and safeguards, are in place before we talk to the consumer. A commitment from those in the industry is the strong foundation on which the green deal can be successfully built.Paul RocheDirector of sustainability and renewables, Grafton Group plc",

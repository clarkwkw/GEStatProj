    "text": "    This week&apos;s element is palladium, which is designated by the atomic symbol Pd and atomic number 46. As you can see in the image above, this rare metal is a lustrous silvery-white colour. Together with the two previous week&apos;s elements, rhodium and ruthenium, palladium makes up part of the so-called platinum group, which also includes iridium, osmium and of course, platinum. These transition metals, which cluster together into groups 8, 9, and 10 in periods 5 and 6 of the periodic table, have similar physical and chemical properties, and tend to co-occur in the same mineral deposits. Like the other members of the platinum group, palladium is rare and thus, quite valuable. Of the platinum group metals, palladium is distinctive because it has the lowest melting point and is the least dense.    Similar to last week&apos;s element, rhodium, most palladium is used in automobile catalytic converters. These metals act as catalysts; an agent that speeds up a chemical reaction without becoming altered or consumed itself by that reaction.  Different transition metals, or combinations thereof, are used as catalysts for different applications, depending upon the sort of pollutants that need to be neutralised. Whilst rhodium is used as a reduction catalyst (where electrons are added to molecules), palladium is used as an oxidation catalyst (where electrons are removed from molecules). For example, reducing nitrogen oxides liberates oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) gases whereas oxidizing carbon monoxide (CO) creates carbon dioxide (CO2). Palladium is particularly useful for removing unburnt and partially burnt hydrocarbons from automobile exhaust to release H2 gas. It also functions well when a car engine first starts &quot;cold&quot;.  In addition to being used by the automobile industry, palladium is used in ceramic capacitors in electronic gadgets such as computers and mobile phones, as fillings in teeth, in jewelry and in spark plugs. Palladium has no known biological role in most living things.

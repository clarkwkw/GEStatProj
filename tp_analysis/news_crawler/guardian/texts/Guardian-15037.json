    "text": "What&apos;s the stereotype most people have of students? We&apos;re seen as boisterous party animals  socialising, drinking and flirting at every opportunity. Our degrees come second to the buzzing social scene that accompanies our first experience of freedom. But that&apos;s not the case for students with Asperger&apos;s syndrome. The National Autistic Society (NAS) informs us that Asperger&apos;s is &quot;a form of autism that affects how a person makes sense of the world, processes information and relates to other people&quot;. People with the condition struggle with social interaction. Things we take for granted, such as being able to read body language or empathise with others, are difficult for them. Around 1 in 100 children have an autistic spectrum disorder in the UK, but nobody knows how many go on to higher education. Many adults with Asperger&apos;s are undiagnosed, and that&apos;s why it&apos;s important to raise awareness. University is a very daunting prospect for those who may not understand why they act differently; a diagnosis can bring reassurance and proper support. Personal experience has taught me that university is a perfectly viable option for &quot;Aspies&quot;, with the correct back-up. Both of my siblings have been diagnosed with Asperger&apos;s syndrome, and have successfully taken courses in computing and photography. Asperger&apos;s is at the &quot;high-functioning&quot; end of the autism spectrum, and individuals that have the condition often excel in a certain area, such as mathematics or science. Richard Brownless studied mathematics at Oxford University. He says: &quot;My very literal, logical and systematic thought processes were instrumental in helping me succeed in my course.&quot; My sister Chloe believes that her Asperger&apos;s allows her to see things differently. &quot;I can pick up on details around me that other people miss, which is why I&apos;m good at taking close-up images.&quot; Both Chloe and my brother, Paul, chose to commute to university rather than live there, which is a simple way of adapting university life to a less socially-active person while offering challenges that will boost independence. Chloe had never travelled alone before starting university, but now gets a train by herself every day and has grown more confident on public transport. Those who do choose to reside at university may find the experience develops their social awareness. Richard says: &quot;I did not socialise much at university, but I did meet with a support worker at least once a week, and they told me that they had seen my social skills and confidence grow immensely since the start of my course.&quot; The noise and disorder of student halls make some students with Asperger&apos;s opt to live alone. Matthew Nielson is an illustration student at Hereford College of Art. &quot;I chose to live alone because I knew, after my years in Headlands and Farleigh [specialist education provisions], that shared houses were not for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I would have eventually lived by myself anyway, though I&apos;m not quite sure when  it may have been a year or two later on.&quot; Nowadays, universities generally offer good support systems to assist with the transition to an independent lifestyle that being a student demands. &quot;They offer me 10 hours of assistance per week,a computer, budgets for supplies like books and two hour-long one-to-ones per week with a lady who helps me with my essays and acts as an arbiter between student and tutor,&quot; says Matthew. The NAS is raising awareness and teaching both lecturers and peers to recognise the traits of Asperger&apos;s syndrome. Matthew says: &quot;A lot of the students didn&apos;t know I had AS. But they are all very good with it.&quot; You can download the NAS&apos;s guide to assisting AS students. When I was applying to university, the advice I got was to portray myself as somebody who was able to make friends easily and &quot;fit in&quot; at university. But for students with autism spectrum conditions, their social problems shouldn&apos;t be a barrier. We should all learn to embrace the differences that come with Asperger&apos;s syndrome  there is widespread speculation that a number of geniuses, Einstein and Newton included, had the condition. I doubt any university would have turned them down for their inability to make appropriate small talk.  More information about dealing with AS at university can be found on the NAS website and in Rosemary Martin&apos;s book Top Tips for Asperger Students.",

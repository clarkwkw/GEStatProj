    "text": "The woodland floor in Burley New Inclosure still wears its winter look, but this is being softened as new growth thrusts through tinder-dry bracken and discarded leaves. Ferns are unfurling their fronds, emerging where path edge and bank unite to give a sheltered niche of moisture and warmth. Each species uncoils in a different way, inviting one to lie down to inspect their individuality and marvel at their delicacy. So too with the conifers; each variety has its own way of shedding the casing of its buds to reveal the shoot within, a wonder of nature&apos;s nano-natural technology. The broad-leaf trees are bursting their buds, some more quickly than others, even where they are siblings. Add to this the textures involved  some smooth and glossy, others downy or sticky  and throw in the many tones of green and hues of yellow, pink and brown, and even before the trees are clad there is more than enough to delight the senses. Flowers have come into full bloom where thinning has taken place and for a few days sunlight has streamed between the trunks. Dainty pink-veined heads of sorrel dance on the breeze and wood anemones cover an entire clearing. Yellowish-green wood spurge stand tall along the margins of the rides, their florets becoming brighter as the sun catches them, while track sides are populated with violets. Tiny yellow pustules appear to be erupting along the bottom of a damp ditch. On closer examination these prove to be tiny fungi, with a yellow head carried on a white stem. The wetter it is, the better they seem to like it, and further on we found some poking up through a small pond that had formed where the ditch was blocked. The New Forest is one of the national strongholds for this species, Mitrula paludosa, commonly known as the &quot;bog beacon&quot;. As we turn from studying them, the calls of a cuckoo in the distance and a chiffchaff across the path, inform that, with the spring, they too have arrived.",

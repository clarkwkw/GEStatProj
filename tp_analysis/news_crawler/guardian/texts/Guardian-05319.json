    "text": "A serious difficulty for games developers, normally so fond of bullets and explosions, is that Batman never uses a gun. The developers of Gotham City Impostors (Monolith, 11.99, PSN/XboxLive/Windows), an online, download-only, first-person shooter based in Batman&apos;s home town, solved the problem of tooling up the Dark Knight by instead having two factions of vigilantes facing off against each other  one group in Bat disguises, the other caked in make-up impersonating his nemesis the Joker. Diving into a death-match places your customisable avatar into a team for six-against-six shooting in Gotham locales. It&apos;s frantic action, with weapons ranging from the conventional shotgun to the more outlandish jack-in-the-box grenade. There are grappling hooks, rollerskates and glider wings with which to traverse the landscape  and it plays pleasingly like a hyped-up Call of Duty. Experienced shooter aficionados will feel right at home and the humour lifts the experience, with rarely a minute passing without an amusingly cheesy one-liner. Fun, but certainly not revolutionary.",

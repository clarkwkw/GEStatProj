    "text": "     Nintendo has created something of a stealth franchise with the Mario vs Donkey Kong series  this is, almost unbelievably, the fifth entry. Minis on the Move shifts attention away from puzzle-platforming to the path-building brainteaser. Essentially an inverted tower-defence game, clearing each stage means guiding toy versions of Mario and friends past such perils as spike pits and wandering enemies. Early levels are deceptively simple until a steady trickle of new gameplay mechanics, including rotating squares and sliding panels, increase difficulty considerably. Persistence will mostly win out, though fiddly and unresponsive tile-swapping sections will test the patience of even the most devoted Mario fans. A charming, largely enjoyable puzzler, well suited to the portable form.",

    "text": "  	 	 	 	 	    This video, taking a brief trip through the history of observing Mars and speculations about life there, was put together for last Tuesday&apos;s BBC Stargazing Live.  Sadly there wasn&apos;t time on the live programme to include the central section, but it has been included on the clip now up on the Stargazing website. This &quot;restored&quot; section included the recreation of an experiment that I blogged about last week. This was an investigation into how we perceive things at the limits of vision carried out by Walter Maunder in the early 20th century, forming part of his attack on claims that artificial &quot;canals&quot; could be seen on the Martian surface. I feature in that section, but look out for my colleague Marek Kukula on William Herschel and Guglielmo Marconi, for Patrick Moore on possible Martian vegetation, and for some lovely shots in Greenwich: the Royal Observatory&apos;s 28-inch telescope, the National Maritime Museum and Queen&apos;s House.",

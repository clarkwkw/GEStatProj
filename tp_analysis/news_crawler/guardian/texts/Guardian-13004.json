    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Bungie, creator and former developer of the Halo series, has announced its new game, Destiny, which it describes as a &quot;shared-world shooter&quot;. Which means that while it looks like a first-person shooter, it will involve collaborating with other players on missions, though the company is at pains to avoid calling it a massively multiplayer online game, and insists that you can complete it solo. At the Sony conference, at which the PS4 was formally announced, it was also confirmed that Destiny would be appearing on the new console. Games out now include Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires (PS3), which adds a tactical layer on top of the franchise&apos;s usual sword-swinging battlefield mayhem, Transport Simulator (PC), letting you experience the unalloyed joy of navigating heavy goods vehicles through busy urban centres, and Dragonborn, Hearthfire and Dawnguard, the three downloadable extensions of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, finally available for PlayStation 3. Dragonborn, at least, is well worth the wait.",

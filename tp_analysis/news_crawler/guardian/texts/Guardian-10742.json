Will anyone survive? &gt;&gt; Pandodaily  How many companies have become massive by merely inspiring people to travel? As the once-crowded market for travel inspiration apps and sites thins out, the answer may actually be zero.   The miracle is that anyone ever believed that a business could be built around something that&apos;s pretty much the opposite of a utility. Exclusive: Inside Google Spanner, the Largest Single Database on Earth | Wired Enterprise | Wired.com  Much like the engineering team that created it, Spanner is something that stretches across the globe while behaving as if it&apos;s all in one place. Unveiled this fall after years of hints and rumors, it&apos;s the first worldwide database worthy of the name -- a database designed to seamlessly operate across hundreds of data centers and millions of machines and trillions of rows of information.  Spanner is a creation so large, some have trouble wrapping their heads around it. But the end result is easily explained: With Spanner, Google can offer a web service to a worldwide audience, but still ensure that something happening on the service in one part of the world doesn&apos;t contradict what&apos;s happening in another.  Google&apos;s new-age database is already part of the company&apos;s online ad system -- the system that makes its millions -- and it could signal where the rest of the web is going.   First MapReduce, now this. Enormously impressive. What happens when your pivot goes horribly wrong? &gt;&gt; Skift Rafat Ali:   Travel is among the most pivot-friendly categories in the startupland. What happens when a well-liked-but-limited app, focused on a nice but commodity niche, attempts to pivot into a larger company, attempting to &quot;reinvent travel&quot;? It cannot go worse than what&apos;s happening right now to GateGuru.   Truly ugly indeed, but for what seem like obvious reasons. BT.com blats small privacy bug, ignores GAPING HOLE &gt;&gt; The Register  BT has squashed a mild website privacy bug reported by a Reg reader - but the telco has refused to address a related issue that allows anyone to add paid-for features to any BT landline.  The latter problem, described by the telco as a &quot;customer convenience&quot;, can be exploited using just a property&apos;s postcode and phone number to cause mischief and inconvenience.  However, the other flaw, which revealed the full name of the landline account holder, has been fixed.   Ouch. Apple CPU orders raise concerns over TSMC production capacity &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Demand from Apple is expected to be huge, said the observers, adding that allocation of TSMC&apos;s available advanced process capacity among its major clients will be a critical decision to be made by the foundry.  TSMC&apos;s advanced process offerings serve the world&apos;s major fabless IC firms including Altera, Qualcomm and Nvidia. While being capable of providing sufficient capacity to Apple, TSMC also does not want to upset its existing major clients, the observers noted. Allocating efficiently its production capacity will be a focus for the foundry in 2013, the observers believe.  Apple&apos;s iPhone and iPad devices collectively demand almost 200 million CPUs every year, the observers estimate.    Previously all those were made by Samsung. Apps are dead. Long live experiences &gt;&gt; cek.log Ex-Microsoftie Charlie Kindel:   I like to get people&apos;s attention by asserting &quot;apps are dead&quot;. I do this because it causes people to pause and think about what &quot;apps&quot; really are. After Apple started the app explosion in 2008 most apps were primarily client-side code. Today, however, it is almost impossible to find an app that does not rely on at least some Internet based service. In fact the apps most people use most of the time are almost all server-side code. The client-side code is there to project the experience on to one of many devices the user may have.  I also believe &quot;apps are dead&quot; because the end-user value proposition is no longer based on some piece of code a user buys in an app store on their device, but an entire experience they choose to use that spans all of their devices.  Microsoft investigating random Windows Phone 8 reboots &gt;&gt; SlashGear  The company told CNET that it&apos;s on the case, saying nothing other than &quot;We are currently investigating reports of these incidents.&quot; The problems don&apos;t seem limited to just random reboots though, as users are reporting issues with email sync. Obviously, these problems aren&apos;t good, and it&apos;s probably a major headache for Microsoft to have to deal with these right after the launch of Windows Phone 8 - a mobile OS that needs to make a great first impression if it hopes to eventually rise in popularity and challenge Android and iOS.  Some users on the WPCentral forums are saying that uninstalling the Skype for Windows Phone 8 preview helps with random reboots, but at the moment, there doesn&apos;t appear to be an on-the-fly fix for the issues with email syncing. It&apos;s also worth pointing out that uninstalling the Skype preview might not be a permanent fix for the reboot issue, as there could be any number of reasons Windows Phone 8 devices are suddenly restarting.

Windows 8 touchscreen laptops see slow atart &gt;&gt; WSJ Digits blog  &quot;Demand for Windows 8 is not that good right now,&quot; said Asustek Computer&apos;s Chief Financial Officer David Chang... Acer declined to give sales figures for its Windows 8 products so far, and executives said last month that they were uncertain how Windows 8 would be received by consumers. Acer&apos;s 15.6in Aspire V5 is the top-selling Windows 8 touchscreen laptop on Amazon&apos;s website, with the Vivobook close behind. However, neither of them - nor any other touchscreen laptop - breaks into the 20 best selling laptops on Amazon.com.   40m licences sold v &quot;not that good&quot; demand. The intrigue continues. Samsung Galaxy Note 2 PC support to silence critics &gt;&gt; ProductReviews  If you were reluctant to believe that a smartphone can handle PC duties, this video alone should give you the clarity you need. After watching the video ourselves, it&apos;s clear to see that it isn&apos;t a fabrication any more - the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 can act as a PC replacement for basic duties.  Before you all go and say, &apos;can it run Skyrim then&apos; - obviously it can&apos;t just yet. What it can do though is run multiple videos at the same time, browse the internet with flash enabled no problem, edit text with copy and paste features and a lot more. You can even set up a Skype call and have videos and web pages open at the same time with the multi window feature.   Very impressive (implementing the idea that the Motorola Atrix tried to in 2011). But either he&apos;s a superintelligent being, or the video of the interaction has been speeded up quite a bit - he flicks between windows and responds to dialog boxes faster than you can possibly see them.

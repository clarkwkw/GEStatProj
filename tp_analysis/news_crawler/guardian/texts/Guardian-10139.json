    "text": "This week&apos;s Best Apps post for new Android apps covers 20 releases from the last week alone. Heady times for Google-powered devices. The list doesn&apos;t include games, as they get their own separate post: this week&apos;s selection included Android titles like Angry Birds Star Wars, Curiosity, Air Patriots, Army of Darkness: Defense and League of Heroes. iOS apps also get their own post, which can be found here this week. Windows Phone has a monthly roundup  the latest one is here. On with this week&apos;s Android apps: Boots Christmas (Free) Retailer Boots has launched a dedicated Christmas app, with details of its festive gifts lineup, and the option to filter them by price, category and the likely recipient. Users can create Gift Lists which can then be sent to Boots&apos; website, and the app also ties into the retailer&apos;s Video Gift Tags, for recording personal video messages to be attached to real presents. Best of Britain - Days Out (2.99) Publisher Archant has rounded up 101 heritage sites from around Britain for this tourism app, from Stonehenge to Balmoral. It&apos;s a 164-page digital book with search features, and the option to save pages or the guide for offline access when on your travels. Goodnight Moon (1.89) US firm Loud Crow Interactive makes exceedingly good children&apos;s book-apps, with Goodnight Moon its latest release on Android (and iOS). It&apos;s based on a 65-year-old print book about a bunny going to bed, with interactivity, photography features and the ability to play nice with seven and 10-inch tablets as well as smartphones. Echofon (Free) Twitter app Echofon is still in beta on Android, so you won&apos;t find it on the Google Play store the link above takes you to UberMedia&apos;s latest build. It&apos;s shaping up as a slick alternative to the official Twitter app, with features for power users as well as newcomers to microblogging. If I Ran The Circus (2.49) This is the latest Dr. Seuss book-app to be released by Oceanhouse Media for Android, focusing on the imaginary Circus McGurkus. The original Seussian artwork is complemented by voice narration, and common to all the publisher&apos;s Dr. Seuss apps words that zoom up when a picture is touched, to aid early readers. Angry Commuters (Free) This app comes from Imperial College London as part of a research trial into commuting in the capital. The idea: download the app, then use it to file a report on your commuting journeys: how happy and relaxed you feel (or not), as well as the conditions of the bus, tube, train or other method of public transport. The results will be published early in 2013, and you get a personalised report on your journeys if you take part. Blockbuster Magazine (Free) The UK arm of video-rental chain Blockbuster has its own print magazine, but now it&apos;s gone digital. That includes Android, where the free app promises monthly news, reviews, interviews and previews of DVDs and games. Audio Glow Live Wallpaper (0.62) There are shedloads of live wallpapers available for Android smartphones and, while most of them are unappealing, Audio Glow has the makings of a good one: a glowing music visualizer that bases its visuals on whatever music (or app sound) is playing at the time. Unsocial (Free) Don&apos;t be fooled by the name: Unsocial is a very social app, and one focused on business. It aims to connect you with relevant work contacts in the same area as you, hooking you up with messaging. There&apos;s also a focus on conferences, though: helping identify the attendees who you haven&apos;t met yet, but who may be most relevant to your work. Wrike  Project Management (Free) Now for something more serious (with fewer rhymes): project management on the go. That&apos;s what Wrike is about on desktop computers, and now it has an Android app for use &quot;whether you are at a meeting, in an airport or on vacation in Haiti&quot;. The app is free for existing users of Wrike. TasKarou Launcher Overlay (Free) This is more about personal productivity on Android tablets: a multitasking launcher overlay that promises to make it quicker to flick between apps, rather than using the default Android controls. Probably good for freeing up regular seconds of funtime on that Haitian vacation... PopAR Planets3D (Free) This is an augmented reality app, part of a series from PopAR Toys designed to work with its range of printed books, cards or simply $1 bills (yes, if you&apos;re using in the UK, you may need to hunt down one of those). The idea: more than 22 3D pop-out planets, spaceships and pieces of planet scenery, superimposed on the real world. Mobento (Free) Armed with the slogan &quot;educational videos to go&quot;, Mobento is aggregating educational videos from the likes of Stanford, Yale, TED, Nasa and Khan Academy, sorting them by category (computers, climate change etc) with the option to stream or download them. I&apos;m wondering what some of the sources will make of the downloading element, mind. AeroPad (2.92) Now, this is specialist in the sense that it&apos;s made by an aircraft pilot for other aircraft pilots to use in the cockpit. In its iOS incarnation it&apos;s won praise from specialist media, and now it&apos;s on Android, optimised for tablets and designed to display PDFs, as well as the pilot&apos;s own notes. Bo&apos;s Bedtime Story (0.80) Developer Heppi has a series of children&apos;s apps on Android starring Bo, a cute cartoon giraffe. This is the latest, based around Bo&apos;s bedtime routine with 10 interactive scenes. The idea is presumably that it will get your kids in the mood for sleepytime (as opposed to in the mood for demanding another go on Angry Birds or they&apos;ll scream and scream). Well, it&apos;s worth a try, and the app does look well-crafted. Snipbase (Free) Snipbase isn&apos;t actually a native Android app, but rather a mobile browser site that&apos;s been optimised for Android devices. It&apos;s all about shopping lists, but rather than being lists of text, they&apos;re made up of photos. Its developer hopes people will find picture-based lists for supermarkets, birthdays and to-do tasks faster and easier to use than words. Glorious Flavour Map (Free) It&apos;s early days for Glorious Flavour Map, but there&apos;s a good idea there: mapping &quot;interesting, tasty, unique and inspirational tastes&quot; around the world, then letting app users browse those near their current location when looking for a decent nosh-up. ConnectMyRide (Free) This app&apos;s in beta for the moment, with a suitably 2012 slogan: &quot;Connect your Car to the Cloud!&quot; What that means is a bit more down-to-earth: tracking your car travel. Distance, duration, fuel usage, CO2 emission and other stats. There are also social features: &quot;Allow friends to follow your trip in real time...&quot; HookHunt (Free) I&apos;m guessing this is more aimed at the US, for hunters and fishers to take on their trips and track their activities. &quot;Capture what matters in the field and have it backed up securely even if you lose your phone,&quot; explains its Google Play listing. But there are also an array of tools: weather, barometer, tidal data and features designed to be used by groups travelling together. ASCII Fireworks Live Wallpaper (Free) Finally, something fun (albeit also something that&apos;s not hugely topical until just under a year&apos;s time). This live wallpaper offers a virtual fireworks display, presented using ASCII characters. Its developer says it&apos;ll play nice with Android tablets as well as smartphones too.

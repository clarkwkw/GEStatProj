    "text": "Think of a city centre university and you tend to think &apos;sprawl&apos;. Scattered buildings with a community feel isn&apos;t usually the name of the game - but Middlesex University has changed all that.  In a decade long project which the university describes as being &quot;of a scale and complexity not attempted by any other university,&quot; Middlesex has completely transformed its estate. It has divested itself of out-of-date buildings that were no longer fit for purpose - or simply not part of a coherent campus vision - and relocated more than 10,000 staff and students to brand new facilities for science, art, design and media, sport, catering and social space. A purpose built, flexibly designed library has been opened, that will accommodate innovations in how information is sourced and used by future students. In addition, every classroom and existing building has been refurbished.  The minimum requirement the university set was that [facilities] should meet or exceed the latest industry standards, so that Middlesex students gained a competitive edge and could be fully prepared for their careers. The project was backed by the academic community who felt strongly that locating subject disciplines on one campus would enrich the academic and cultural lives of students, encourage the cross-pollination of ideas and expertise. All new students will now be based on our single London campus. With all university teaching locations and social spaces within walking distance of each other, no car journeys are now made between campuses. Two of the new builds gained BREEAM excellent ratings, and the project has also benefited people living in the area, as environmental improvements to leisure areas and wildlife habitats, as well as involvement in community learning, have been part of Middlesex&apos;s commitment to integrating its campus development with the local borough plan.",

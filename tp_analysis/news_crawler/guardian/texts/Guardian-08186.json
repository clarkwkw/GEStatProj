    "text": "The little owl&apos;s apprehensive cry alerted me to the presence of a fox in the meadow bordering the Hayling Billy Trail. As I scrambled down the bank and crouched low behind a screen of brambles, I could chart the animal&apos;s progress across the field by listening for the blackbird&apos;s rattling alarm call, which was taken up bird by bird along the boundary hedgerow. Iwatched as the fox zigzagged towards me, sunlight glinting on its russet fur. The slender body, narrow face and lustrous pelage marked it out as a sub-adult, most likely a vixen. The meadow was recently mown, and every so often the fox stopped to rake at the ground with her paws, disturbing the insects sheltering beneath the thatch. As she nosed through the cuttings, her pointed snout left tapered impressions in the dried grass. Darting forward, she deftly plucked a beetle from a blade of grass with a snap of her teeth, before prancing off in pursuit of a crane fly. Fox cubs take time to learn the art of hunting, so when their parents stop providing for them and they are forced to satisfy their own hunger, they initially subsist on a diet of easily caught earthworms and beetles. Thanks to the cool, damp summer, there was evidently a bountiful supply of invertebrate prey in the meadow, but now the young vixen appeared to have her sights set on more substantial quarry. The fox ran her tongue over her nose and sniffed the breeze. Picking up a scent, she pricked her angular ears, flicked her white-tipped brush and began to stalk. As she moved, her head swung ever so slightly from side to side, her moist nose quivering. Suddenly she froze, one foreleg raised as she cocked her head to pinpoint her hidden victim. With her amber eyes fixed on a matted tussock, she sprang into the air. Her body arched elegantly as she pounced, her forepaws pinning her prey to the ground. Asshe plunged her muzzle into the grass there was a rustle, a squeak, and the dull crunch of small bones. Maybe a mouse, maybe a vole; I could not see.",

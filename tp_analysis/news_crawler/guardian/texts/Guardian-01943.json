    "text": "    It&apos;s a rather gloomy morning today, so I thought I&apos;d lighten things up by showing you a video about happy numbers.  Happy numbers? you ask. What is a happy number? How can a number be happy? Are there sad numbers too?    Let me tell you what is a happy number in terms of how it is defined mathematically. First, take any positive integer and square it. We&apos;ll use seven as an example: 72 = 49 Then take each digit of this number, square them and add them together: 42 + 92 = 16 + 81 = 97  and repeat:  92 + 72 = 81 + 49 = 130 12 + 32 + 02 = 1 + 9 = 10 12 + 02 = 1 Those numbers where this process ends in one are happy numbers whilst those numbers for which this operation does not end in one are sad numbers. Sad numbers often produce an endlessly repeating loop of numbers. If you enjoyed this, then you&apos;ll also be interested to know that if a number is happy, then all members of its sequence are happy; but if a number is unhappy, all members of its sequence are likewise unhappy. In this video, Ria Symonds explains:             Visit numberphile&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  You might have also noticed that in addition to being a happy number, seven is also a prime number, which makes it the smallest happy prime number.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

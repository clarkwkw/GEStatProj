    "text": "A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team FOSS Patents: Judge holds Google to infringe 8 more Java files &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents was first to publish 6 of them Florian Mller:   On Friday afternoon by local time, Judge William Alsup, the federal judge presiding over the Oracle v. Google lawsuit in the Northern District of California, entered a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) overruling the jury (as well as Google&apos;s opposition to an Oracle motion for JMOL) with respect to eight decompiled Java files.   Mller had originally said - in January 2011, 15 months ago - that 6 of those files were copied from Java into Android, and hence must be infringing. Turns out he was right (at least if you think the judge is right. And the judge is, well, a judge.) Groklaw - Google Files for SJ on Copyright Damages; Oracle: Could We Wait and Get a New Jury Instead? ~pj  So Oracle has now filed a motion asking for a postponement of phase three of the trial, the damages phase. It would like a new jury, too. It wants to wait to calculate damages until after the judge decides whether APIs are copyrightable, so it can add the 37 API files into the mix for damages, if they are. Maybe then it would have a prayer of getting some money.  In short, Oracle woke up and realized it&apos;s in a pickle of its own making. It was too clever by half, and now reality has struck. It clearly is worried that if they go to the damages phase now, it will gain a big fat zero in damages. It should have thought of that before it asked for infringer&apos;s profits, but there you are.   The problem with Groklaw&apos;s analyses is that it imputes motives that just don&apos;t exist, and acts as though Google&apos;s lawyers are geniuses, and Oracle&apos;s are idiots. Given that Oracle&apos;s lead attorney is David Boies, who prosecuted the Microsoft antitrust trial in 1998, you&apos;d think its writers would be more conflicted. Apparently not. The head of Google News on the future of news &gt;&gt; MIT Center for Civic Media  Richard [Gringras, head of news at Google] doesn&apos;t believe the vertical model of a newspaper makes sense going forward. He compares the metropolitan newspapers&apos; all-things to all-people product to content portals for specific communities. This strategy doesn&apos;t make sense given the possibilities. Yahoo!&apos;s initial success was as a portal. But portals have disappeared online as consumers have learned to navigate the web on their own and found the niche sites they love.  Paywalls are not a panacea. Richard&apos;s not against experimentation with paywall models. The New York Times was smart, he says, in designing its paywall with many levers to adjust revenue vs. traffic flow. It&apos;s not there yet, but they can experiment and find what works. He appreciates those who are looking at paywalls in a more nuanced way. Some publishers say, &quot;They bought it before, they&apos;ll buy it again,&quot; or &quot;We need to get people back into the habit of paying for news.&quot; But consumers never did pay the true costs.   Gringras essentially goes around giving much the same talk. This doesn&apos;t make it wrong. Can Dell&apos;s open source XPS Ultrabook steal Apple&apos;s thunder? &gt;&gt; Forbes By &quot;Trefis contributor&quot;:   Dell has announced a six-month, open source pilot program aimed at creating an ultrabook suited specifically for web and mobile developers. The Macbook Air and other OSX based machines have become the development environment of choice for a lot of web and mobile developers recently most likely due to software such as iLife, iMovie and other design tools.   Sure, what developers really want is to be able to organise their photos and cut little films. Dell&apos;s efforts here are praiseworthy, but iLife and iMovie really aren&apos;t the reason why the Macbook Air has succeeded with developers. Try: lightness and SSD. Linus Torvalds v Github&apos;s Pull Request: &gt;&gt; Github The king of Linux vents on how rubbish Github is (for writing OS kernels, presumably). Fascinating to see it play out. Will Apple&apos;s maps move bring a real and perhaps better Google Maps to iOS? &gt;&gt; Marketingland Greg Sterling, making a lot of sense about why Apple&apos;s maps product on iOS is so much worse than Google&apos;s on Android, despite having the same back-end supplier:   Here&apos;s a bit of conspiracy theory: What if Apple wanted to replace Google Maps from a very early point and the company was biding its time until it could acquire and build the core assets and expertise to do so? Maybe that early point was when former CEO Steve Jobs&apos; attitude toward Google changed, when he began to feel that Android was &quot;a stolen product&quot;?  To continue with my conjecture, maybe Apple thought it would be harder to wean iPhone users off a stronger Google-powered mapping product than the comparatively weak one that exists today. I know this seems very contrary to Apple&apos;s culture and corporate ethos. Yet replacing a weaker product with a stronger one is a lot easier than taking away a strong product from users who&apos;ve come to depend on it.   Also, Google could then offer its own Google Maps app. Win-win. Amnesty International UK website was compromised to serve Gh0st RAT &gt;&gt; Security Labs  Between May 8 and 9, 2012, the Websense ThreatSeeker Network detected that the Amnesty International United Kingdom website was compromised. The website was apparently injected with malicious code for these 2 days. During that time, website users risked having sensitive data stolen and perhaps infecting other users in their network. However, the website owners rectified this issue after we advised them about the injection. In early 2009, we discovered this same site was compromised, and in 2010, we reported another injection of an Amnesty International website, this time the Hong Kong site.   Take note. Adobe CS6 Installer: Continuing a proud tradition of user hostility &gt;&gt; Betalogue Entertaining, though not as bad as in the past. One point that always resonates:   One day, maybe, an Adobe engineer will understand that, when the user has to go through a length installation process, the best approach is to let him enter all the required information (password, serial number, etc.) right away, and then -- and only then -- go through all the lengthy processes that are of no interest to him without asking for any user input, so that he can switch to something else and, you know, actually make valuable use of his time.

Exp comp -1    Question: This African mystery bird species has appeared in films -- can you name a film you&apos;ve seen this species in without duplicating anyone else? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: Well, well, well, who&apos;s facepalming now? When I asked the mystery bird question, I thought it would inspire a few lurkers to join the conversation (I know you&apos;re out there because you send me email!) and I thought such an offbeat question would also be a nice change of pace. But it turns out that I suffered a bit of a brain fart: I was certain I&apos;d seen this species (or maybe I&apos;d seen a local UK species that had been made up to look like this species) in a Harry Potter film -- specifically, in Hagrid&apos;s pumpkin patch. But a quick zoom through Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban revealed my error. I&apos;d love to blame my erroneous memory on having ingested excellent alcohol or drugs, but alas, I cannot. Not even over-the-counter migraine medications are that good. So I will have to credit this false memory to having an overactive imagination.  This handsome bird is an adult African pied crow, Corvus albus, a corvid that is actually a crow-sized raven. The pied crow occurs everywhere throughout sub-Saharan Africa except in dense forests. They are omnivorous and opportunistic foragers and scavagers, and will congregate in large numbers around a source of food, such as slaughterhouses and rubbish dumps. As such, they often are found near humans. Males and females build a large, untidy nest in a tall tree or on a telephone pole and both sexes tend the young.  Crows and ravens are placed into one large genus, Corvus, in the taxonomic family Corvidae, which is a family of songbirds that have a nearly worldwide distribution. Most crows and ravens are completely black, which makes these birds challenging to distinguish, especially when visiting a locale where the avifauna is unfamiliar.  To restore your faith in my abilities, I will list some general clues that will help you distinguish ravens and crows:  ravens generally are larger with a heavier body build, a heavier bill and thicker legs than crows  ravens have glossy, elongated pointed feathers on the neck that gives them a &quot;shaggy&quot; appearance, which crows lack  in flight, ravens have a long wedge-shaped tail whilst crows have a comparatively shorter squared-off tail that is fan shaped when spread, and ravens have longer, more tapered wings whilst crows&apos; wings are shorter, thicker and more rounded  behaviourally, ravens tend to soar for extended periods of time (they can be mistaken for raptors in flight), whereas crows rarely soar  socially, ravens occur alone, in pairs or small family groups and only rarely in flocks whilst crows can occur in large groups numbering well into the hundreds, especially in the late summer and autumn when they roost communally  auditorially, ravens&apos; voices tend to be deeper and more croaking than the voices of crows, although young ravens and crows both have higher pitched voices than do their parents. Additionally, ravens -- and especially crows -- can mimic other birds It is also important to keep in mind that there are very few places in the world where you will have to distinguish between three Corvus species, although you will often encounter two corvids whose ranges overlap. Most places where Corvus species do co-occur, will usually have one raven and one crow species. In locales with two crow species (as on the eastern and western seaboards of North America), often the best way to distinguish them is by voice.  All that stuff said, it&apos;s also important to keep in mind that these are general identification tips -- there are exceptions, and regardless of how good you are with birds, you will not be able to identify (with certainty) all Corvus species that you encounter.

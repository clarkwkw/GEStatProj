    "text": "The cranefly shines like a fluorescent strip light in a clump of germander speedwell growing on an anthill. There are rare moments when the rain stops, the sun comes out and life that was hidden returns to the open. There are even rarer moments when the light is so clear, and the air so cleansed by downpours, that the experience of life is so intense it&apos;s like seeing things for the first time. The spotted cranefly is gold with black bands. With that comic genius of daddy-longlegs, she is poised on the painfully delicate scaffolding of her legs perhaps to lay eggs in this beautiful meadow. Towering high above are spear thistles, majestic and razor-wired with purple pommels. The thistle flowers are visited by flying insects and have become stages for sensory performance, upside down. We are used to thinking of butterflies as the most spectacular and chosen of insects, something like mobile flowers. There is a different aesthetic for moths, which have a reputation for crepuscular, carpet-eating dullness. The opposite is true on the thistle flowers. The meadow brown butterflies are wearing warehouse overalls compared to burnet moths, turned out for cabaret in black silk and scarlet satin. A female Oedemera beetle, emerald green as glass, prepares herself in the pinky-purple exploding rays of greater knapweed flowers. Brown and orange soldier beetles mate in the corners of yellow hawksbit. A neon-blue needle damselfly measures against the lines of grass blades. Bridal-white meadow saxifrage flowers, toffee-coloured field waxcap mushrooms, cerise pyramidal orchids, rose-pink musk mallow: all these vivid, psychedelic flowers and insects appear for just a moment and inhabit a place which could so easily not exist at all.",

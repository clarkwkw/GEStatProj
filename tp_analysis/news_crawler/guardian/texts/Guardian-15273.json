    "text": "Nasa&apos;s chief administrator, Charles Bolden, talks of &quot;man&apos;s destiny  to go forward to another planet&quot; in your report about a possible mission to Mars (Would-be astronauts boldly go for the chance of 1,000-day mission, 7 may). Surely, in 2013, it is no longer appropriate to use the word &quot;man&quot; to represent both men and women? The first female astronaut left the atmosphere in June 1963 and since then there have been 57 women in space. Dr Nancy Roman was Nasa&apos;s first female chief astronomer in 1960 and her work culminated in the Hubble space telescope. Dr Sally Ride was the first US woman to orbit Earth in June 1983 and devoted much of her life to encouraging girls to pursue careers in science and astronomy. Dr Kathryn Sullivan was the first woman to successfully conduct a spacewalk in 1984. Col Eileen Collins was the first woman to pilot the space shuttle in 1995 and in 1999 became the first woman commander of space shuttle mission. Dr France A Cordova was Nasa chief scientist 1993-96. Shana Dale was deputy administrator of Nasa in 2005-08, followed by Lori Garver in 2009. Dr Shannon Lucid made her first space flight in 1985, later serving as Nasa&apos;s chief scientist 2002-03. And most recently, Dr Peggy Whitson has accumulated 377 days in space, the most for any US astronaut. She was also the first female commander of the international space station and has conducted more space walks than any other female astronaut. From 2009-12, Whitson was chief of the Astronaut Corps at Nasa. To imply that Nasa astronauts are exclusively male is offensive and lazy.Kate Andrews-DayErskineville, New South Wales, Australia",

Click here to view The first story-driven downloadable content for Dishonored is The Knife Of Dunwall, putting you in the stealthy boots of Daud the assassin, the man responsible for killing the empress, thereby starting the whole dishonouring process. There are three substantial missions that open new areas of Dunwall, and they prove much harder than the main game and at least as intense. We learn more about our Michael Madsen-voiced antihero as well as discovering fresh skills and enemies in this brilliant add-on.",

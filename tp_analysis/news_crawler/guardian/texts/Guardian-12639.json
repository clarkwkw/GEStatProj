    "text": "They can cling to rocks battered by the most violent seas and support the weight of an adult human, and now the adhesive power of the mussel is being exploited by researchers who have uncovered the chemical secret of its ability to stick to wet surfaces. Developments being pursued in the wake of this breakthrough include water-resistant glues that will allow doctors to attach insulin-secreting patches to the internal organs of diabetics. Researchers are also working on mussel-based sealants to patch over holes in foetal membranes which can trigger miscarriages. The developments were revealed yesterday at a special session on mussel adhesion at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston. Professor Herbert Waite, of University College Santa Barbara, told delegates: &quot;A couple of them clinging to a rock can support the weight of a fully grown human.&quot; The common mussel Mytilus edulis exudes a sticky glue from its base and uses this to keep itself anchored to rocks and boulders even when pounded by the most savage of seas. &quot;The key to the strength of this glue is a chemical called dopa which is related to the drugs used to treat Parkinson&apos;s disease,&quot; added Waite. &quot;If you add this to various polymers you can create a glue that is every bit as powerful as one that is secreted by the mussel. It is also tolerated by the human body  our glue will be water-resistant just like mussel adhesive and that gives some very exciting uses.&quot; This point was backed by Phillip Messersmith, of Northwestern University, Illinois. He has developed a sealant using chemicals derived from mussel glue and has shown that it possesses the ability to repair defects in human foetal membranes. At present, there is no effective method to repair such holes when they appear. Using patches coated with mussel-based water-resistant glues could provide the solution, said Messersmith. These have now been tested on foetal material in the laboratory and were effective in sealing tiny holes in membrane tissue. Waite also revealed that other groups were developing mussel-based adhesives for bonding pieces of broken bone or tooth. &quot;These glues are tolerated by the body and water-resistant  and that is perfecting for making repairs inside the body.&quot;",

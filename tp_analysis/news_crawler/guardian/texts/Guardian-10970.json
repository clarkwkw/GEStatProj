    "text": "Dear Reader. Yes, you. I&apos;m giving you a mission, and you should choose to accept it for all our sakes. Because we&apos;re told from an early age that for democracy to work, we have to participate, place our votes, and make our opinions on the big issues count. And that&apos;s just the vote for Strictly Come Dancing.  To me, learning about how we weigh up evidence and risk in health is as important as learning about the voting system or managing our finances. I&apos;m studying for a degree in Health Science and Statistics, so I guess you&apos;d expect me to say that. But honestly, just as we become better citizens by being part of the democratic process, we&apos;ll become better patients by knowing who decides what to do when we&apos;re ill, and how they reach that decision. And sorry, but that involves more than watching Holby City once a week. For a start, I&apos;m not convinced that many doctors have extramarital affairs. When we&apos;re diagnosed with something, from hay fever to heart disease, our doctors prescribe a treatment and we trust them. We assume we&apos;re getting the newest, shiniest thing available and that it&apos;s safe. But incredibly, we don&apos;t always have proper evidence of a drug&apos;s effects. There are many grey areas when it comes to deciding how best to treat an illness. So you might be prescribed a drug because it&apos;s the cheapest, or the newest, or because it&apos;s the thing the doctor has always used since graduating 20 years ago, or because the drug rep they fancy gave them a nice bottle of wine for Christmas.  More importantly, it might be prescribed because a trial was pronounced successful when in fact it was just done on a few unrepresentative people, for not long enough, and not against a like-for-like competitor (ie the best treatment currently on the market), but a sugar pill. Incredibly, it might not have been the only trial that was done, but other less shiny results have not been published. There are all kinds of ways drug trials can be biased, and sadly the problems are still endemic.  The truth is, there are plenty of times when we just don&apos;t know what&apos;s best. We might have the option of two or three different treatments but they&apos;ve never been tested against each other, so your doctor&apos;s guess is as good as mine. So here&apos;s a crazy idea: rather than take our best guess, would it not be better to make your best guess and have the result recorded so it can benefit future treatment decisions? A clinical trial as it were, but after the drug has been approved for use?  A perfect example is cited in the book Testing Treatments. Imogen Evans et al explain how virtually every child diagnosed with leukaemia in the 1960s died quite soon after diagnosis, but at the time of the book&apos;s latest edition (2011) the disease had an 85% survival rate. All of this is due to randomised trials testing new treatments against the current standards of the time, on real patients in a clinical setting. Testing works. So what&apos;s stopping us? In principle it should be pretty easy. But while the randomised controlled trial is the gold standard when it comes to studying health outcomes, it&apos;s often considered too much like hard work or too expensive to implement. And there&apos;s often more red tape than Santa will be using to wrap his worldwide gift quota this year.  Absurdly, it&apos;s easier to choose arbitrary treatments for everyone, than to suggest one treatment for half the people who need it and another treatment for the other half. That makes it a trial, and as soon as you turn your treatment suggestion into a trial, you have to jump through all kinds of administrative hoops. This is what makes RCTs the gold standard rather than the norm. Nobody likes the paperwork, and wearing suits to committees costs a fortune in dry cleaning bills. The other problem with trials is they often address an abstract idea, rather than outcomes for real people. You don&apos;t want to know if one chemical affects another in a petri dish, you want to know whether this will help your Uncle Ted stay off dialysis for another few years. You want to know whether a treatment works in a clinical setting. At the hospital ward you visit Auntie Nelly in, or on the snuffly people in the GP&apos;s waiting room. Not in a lab full of people in protective goggles and white coats wielding pipettes. But what if we could collect data by accessing routine health records? It could be cheap, have a wide representative population, and be unobtrusive to both patients and the doctors treating them. Well, we already do. Thanks to the National Health Service, the UK is unique. We&apos;ve been collecting health data on almost everyone for the last 70 years.  Think about that for a moment. That&apos;s a pretty awesome mine of information. And now health records are held electronically, long term, unobtrusive and easily anonymised data can be collected from samples of people over a wide area. So this might have happened to your health records already. It&apos;s OK, the 1998 Data Protection Act, use of a coding system and a whole posse of ethics committees will have protected you, and no researcher will ever be able to pin down that it was you, Mary Smith of 37 Railway Cuttings, who had that peculiar rash after your week in Lanzarote. But so far the data collected is only really used to look at outcomes from treatment over the long term, it&apos;s not used to recruit people into trials. A recent paper in the BMJ by Tjeerd-Pieter van Staa and colleagues suggests that could quite easily become the next step. Trials like these are called REACT trials  Random Evaluation of Accepted Choices in Treatment. It&apos;s just a fancy way of saying &quot;we&apos;re comparing one treatment with another and seeing what&apos;s best&quot;. All you need is to compile a profile of the ideal participant, and they could be flagged up when they walk into the GP&apos;s office. Sorted. The only thing to change would be that an arbitrary decision about how to treat you would be based on a random allocation instead. It&apos;s cheap, easy, and a great way to see uncertainties over treatments resolved. Except, of course, for the red tape. Remember the irony I described earlier? Because this would be a REACT trial, they need your permission to go ahead. If it was an arbitrary decision, you would not need to give your permission at all. It&apos;s the whole allocating thing that creates a problem. Patient involvement and transparency in all stages of clinical trials is vital. The European Commission is slowly waking up to the fact that its policy needs an overhaul.  So here&apos;s what we need to do. As patients, as amateur scientists, as citizens who want to help create a better medical future. You need to ask your GP about whether the practice agrees in principle with REACT trials, you need to ask if they&apos;re subscribing to the concept and happily put your name forward for when they do. Release your medical records to nice, discrete researchers who will be able to make real use of them. You know it makes sense.

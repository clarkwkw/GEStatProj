    "text": "One of the government&apos;s policies, at least, is being crowned with almost instant success. The hike in tuition fees may have filled London&apos;s streets with angry young people and their parents  not to mention a few prison cells. But it&apos;s thinned out the crush in the corridors ofBritain&apos;s elite universities. It was a pincer movement. The drive to make exams harder created an estimated fall of 5,000 in the number of A-level students who got at least two As and a B. Now, athird of the UK&apos;s top universities are still seeking students for the autumn. The coalition wouldn&apos;t be stupid enough to announce baldly that its punitive fees policies were there to establish a stronger and more weighty delineation between elite degrees and what they privately call &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; degrees. They prefer to bring in a &quot;market mechanism&quot; to do their dirty work. It wouldn&apos;t be so dreadful if this kind of policy were honestly and sensitively pursued. One consequence of the huge expansion in higher education is that degrees are now needed for jobs that previously didn&apos;t require them. You could earn as you learned in a serious career, with your employer paying for your training via day-release. Now, you have to pay for it all yourself, not knowing whether you will have a job at the end of it. Progress? Not really.",

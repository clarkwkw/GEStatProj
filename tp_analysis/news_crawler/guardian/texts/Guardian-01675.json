    "headline": "Science Weekly podcast: What role should science play in politics?", 
    "text": "The relationship between science and politics is often fraught, and occasionally dysfunctional. What can be done to improve it? In government, does the design of scientific advisory systems actually affect policy outcomes? What weight does scientific advice really have with ministers? On the eve of a new paper on this subject, we speak to Chris Tyler and Rob Doubleday from the University of Cambridge&apos;s Centre for Science and Policy. They&apos;ve been trying to come up with a series of pointers for improving the way science is used to inform public policy.  Also in the studio is Mark Henderson, journalist and author of the forthcoming book, The Geek Manifesto, in which he suggests how we can entrench scientific thinking more deeply in public life.  We also hear from the minister for universities and science, David Willetts, and from Imran Khan, director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering.

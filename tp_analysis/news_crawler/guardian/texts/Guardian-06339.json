    "text": "Some will look on Spidey&apos;s latest outing and see a thinly veiled clone of Batman: Arkham City, and in many ways they are right. However, imitation has never been a problem for other genres and when the results are as eye catching as this, developer Beenox at least deserves the chance to convince us that this is more than some tribute act. And it largely does. The Amazing Spider-Man kicks off months after Curt Connors  aka the Lizard  is safely behind bars, told through a semi-interactive intro that sends Gwen and Spidey back to Oscorp minutes before all hell breaks loose. In play, it returns to the open-city style last seen in Spider-Man 2, allowing you virtually free reign to web-sling your way through New York, picking out objectives on your trusty new smartphone Satnav. There are optional distractions to the main action, including picking up collectable items and taking photographs, but your main concern remains saving the city from genetic freaks and Oscorp&apos;s ham-fisted attempts to contain them. Spidey&apos;s enemies come in all shapes; from bots that can be battered by hand, to mutant hybrids and larger mechs that must be disabled &quot;boss-style&quot; through targeting hotspots. And, of course, there are the super-villains such as Rhino and Scorpion who, despite being reduced to mere mutations rather than compelling characters with their own backstories, still look brilliant and take considerable speed and patience to wear down. There are also stealth sections, admittedly more appropriate to the Dark Knight than wise-cracking Spidey, but still fun when sticking to the shadows, thinning the herd one goon at a time. So far so good, but in many ways The Amazing Spider-Man is more impressive to watch than play. Outdoors in the city, movement is basically a question of picking a direction and holding down a single button. Fortunately, you also have a Web Rush move that can pick out a spot and motion-blur towards it, slowing time as you do so to lock onto or web-shoot enemies.     The Amazing Spider-Man    Indeed, agility is one area where Spidey has Batman clearly beaten  with wall and roof crawls providing some stunning angles from which to view the action. However, when you try this is combat, you&apos;re up against a stubbornly roving camera that often reduces you to frantic button mashing as you try and orientate yourself. Even with abilities that are steadily upgraded as you progress, The Amazing Spider-Man never feels quite as precise as you might wish thanks largely to quicktime instructions that come too thick and fast for the timed responses. Finally, although the cast say their lines competently, for a major franchise reboot like this, it&apos;s surprising that Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans could not be persuaded to reprise their roles from the movie. That sounds like a long list of niggles  which is a pity, because The Amazing Spider-Man does have real scale, pace and playability and is occasionally thrilling to behold. And button-mashy though the gameplay is, if you can live with that age old staple, you can start reeling off massive hit combos almost from the offset, which means the action is both great to look at and has relentless momentum. It shows a classic hero beginning to punch at Marvel&apos;s considerable box office weight ... but personally, I&apos;d still rather be in Arkham City.  Game reviewed on PS3",

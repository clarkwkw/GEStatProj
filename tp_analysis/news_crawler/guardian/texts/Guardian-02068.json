    "text": "A war of ideals has broken out at TED 2012. Peter Diamandis and Paul Gilding have given opposing (and sequential) talks on the state of the Earth&apos;s resources. Diamandis made a case for optimism  that we&apos;ll invent, innovate and create ways to solve the challenges that loom over us. According to Diamandis, we are living in an extraordinary time. In fact, this is the BEST time ever. And exponentially growing technologies are going to make it even better. Gilding took another approach: &quot;I&apos;m here to tell you: the the Earth is full. It&apos;s game over.&quot; Gilding says that we just can&apos;t go on as we are. We&apos;re over-using the earth&apos;s resources. And it&apos;s just a matter of time before it catches up with us.

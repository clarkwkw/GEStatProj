    "text": "Early reviews are out, and the critical consensus is: wow. As the last blockbuster game to be released this side of Christmas, tropical open-world first-person-shooter Far Cry 3 (Xbox 360 / PC / PS3) could easily have been met with excellence-induced ennui. Reviewers have already had to slog through the unreasonable brilliance of a glut of series-defining sequels, from Assassin&apos;s Creed to Black Ops and Borderlands, and could be forgiven for taking depth, freedom and exhilarating action for granted. Far Cry 3, though, has all the inspired mayhem of its competitors plus an ace in the hole: unforgettable villains. And villains are vital. Just ask the audience at your local panto. The louder the children hiss and boo, the louder they&apos;ll cheer when the hero triumphs. The fouler the monster, the mightier its slayer must become, and Far Cry 3&apos;s pirate-slaver Vaas is deliciously and devilishly foul. At once brutal, poetic, feral and effeminate, he&apos;s a triumph of design, writing, motion-capture and acting. When he&apos;s on screen you almost don&apos;t dare make eye-contact. One villain this great would be an achievement. The fact he&apos;s one of several equally dark, adult and blood-chilling antagonists is staggering. Far Cry 3 begins with our every-lad hero Jason Brody bound and awaiting death or slavery at the hands of Vaas and his pirates,  of the speedboats and grenades kind, not peg-legs and parrots  who control all but a single tribal village of the fallen paradise of Rook Island. Here, on an idyllic holiday with his friends, Brody begins the game a whimpering civilian, quaking at violence and panting as he scrabbles to escape his captors. Slowly, with the help of the local tribesmen, he sets about rescuing his friends from the island&apos;s madmen, and we see Brody morph from bloke into berserker, becoming a monster in his own right. In gameplay terms, it&apos;s a well-built hybrid of Assassin&apos;s Creed, Grand Theft Auto and an RPG shooter such as Borderlands, with just about all the best bits of each. The first, in particular, shares a lot of the same DNA, as you&apos;d expect from a game made at the same time by the same developers. Stealth is handled very similarly in both, complete with lobbed rocks to distract guards, silent kills from above and below, and the usual mix of ultra-cool make-your-own-action-film moves, such as chained machete and throwing knife takedowns and zip-wire assassinations. The sandbox dynamics, too, are familiar. Far Cry 3&apos;s radio towers act like Assassin&apos;s Creed&apos;s eagle&apos;s nests, revealing chunks of the surrounding area when scaled, and doling out the open world in manageable fragments. The player can capture outposts from the pirates, claiming them for his tribal allies, making them available as fast-travel points and retooling stations. S ide-quests are also reminiscent of Assassin&apos;s Creed, with collectibles scattered across the islands, as well as assassination missions, tribal combat training, hunting challenges and time-trial supply runs making use of the island&apos;s many vehicles. In fact, Rook Island is littered with old cars and jeeps, and liberally sprinkled with abandoned jet-skis and cliff-top hang-gliders. Grab an old 4x4 and cruise the dirt roads, dodging, fleeing or attacking pirate convoys, and it starts to feel like GTA: Jungle. Not that free-roaming is ever leisurely: in pirate territory there&apos;s a constant sense of danger, with patrolling jeeps doing the rounds and vicious local wildlife, from bears to komodo dragons, waiting to maul players who step off the beaten tracks. Then, of course, there&apos;s the shooting. Far Cry 3 is, despite its many other attractions, a first-person shooter at heart, with a sizable arsenal of pistols, shotguns, assault and sniper rifles to discover, customise and sling across your back, plus explosives, flame throwers, incendiary arrows and all sorts of other fireworks. All of which are quite a bit more effective if you take the time to craft holsters and ammo pouches to carry them. While these can be scavenged or bought, they&apos;re much more reliably sourced by skinning one or two of every animal on the island like a sick, inverted Noah. Players keen to preserve their animal rights record can focus on herbal medicine instead, creating syringes granting health and stat boosts from the island&apos;s flowers. There&apos;s even a primitive RPG-style skill tree and experience system, letting the player unlock new stealth takedowns, better crafting abilities or improved combat reflexes to suit their playing style. The multiplayer modes can&apos;t quite live up to the complexity of the campaign, but with an immersive world, tight gameplay and a mesmerising cast of villains, Far Cry 3 is a complete adventure. Far Cry 3 is released in the UK on 30 November and in the US on 4 December ",

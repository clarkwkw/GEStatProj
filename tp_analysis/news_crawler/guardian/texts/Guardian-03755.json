    "text": "True Love  which had its world premiere at Sci-Fi London on Friday  attempts to deconstruct a marriage by placing a couple in separate cells and forcing each to watch incriminating CCTV footage of the other, while an electronic voice repeats, &quot;Love is truth&quot;. At the beginning of the film, before the awfulness of the production had fully revealed itself, I had wondered which science experiments had influenced the script. Research on punishment, incarceration and separation by Stanley Milgram, Harry Harlow, Philip Zimbardo, or even the prisoner&apos;s dilemma? During the Q&amp;A I asked the writer/producer team, Fabio Resinaro and Fabio Guaglione, about their science influences. I was told there were none and they didn&apos;t really think the film belonged in the science-fiction genre. I reflected on the film&apos;s objectified nod to dystopias: a shot of the female lead reading Orwell&apos;s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Certainly this had been affected and desperate. A line of dialogue had caught my attention, stating that for meaningful relationships &quot;  a mutual process of empathy is needed&quot;. I tried to reengage with their thinking by asking a second question: with the new wave of research on the significance of empathy, what popular science had they been reading? Again Resinaro answered: &quot;I did not do any research, I just thought the line up. I just love the way people see things in this film that were never on my mind.&quot;            Watch the trailer for True Love on YouTube Resinaro admitted he had wanted to make a feature as a Hollywood calling card and, with the minuscule budget at his disposal, had tried to think of the cheapest story, deciding that a single set (the cell) and shaky video of compromising inserts was just about affordable. Perhaps someone should have told Resinaro that the first step when making a movie, no matter the size of the budget, is a good script and that their script with its fragmented narrative, was an insurmountable problem. Not only does the dissection of the couple&apos;s relationship  consisting of his confession of infertility, exposure of her affair and his bragging that his wife was rich  never hang together, or build to any climax, True Love utterly fails to surmount these superficial sketches to create a cohesive whole. The majority of the film consists of retrospective, supposed revelations, but these moments are hollow and boring without the necessary introspection. With no time to get to know the couple prior to their solitary confinement and exposure to their spouse&apos;s confessions, this film never becomes greater than its excruciatingly mediocre parts.  True Love&apos;s forced and preachy dialogue self-consciously proclaims that &quot;betrayal&quot; and &quot;redemption&quot; are the agenda, but when did the expositional yelling of such nouns ever create the sentiment? (Weren&apos;t they taught &quot;show don&apos;t tell&quot; in their creative writing classes at school?) When the husband rumbles his wife&apos;s lover&apos;s handyman disguise, a supposed life-and-death moment, the husband&apos;s inner torment is expressed by hissing his pivotal line through clenched jaws: &quot;What kind of fridge do I have?&quot;. It was laughable. The characters were crudely drawn caricatures and the performances lacked any humanity. Gabriel Myers&apos;s performance was particularly toe-curling.  On the Mercurio Domina website Resinaro and Guaglione state they are self-taught filmmakers  and doesn&apos;t it show. They had previously produced only shorts: True Love&apos;s premise had the feel of a short film idea that had been strung out way beyond its capacity to entertain. I had really wanted to enjoy this film. This is the first year the British Film Institute has collaborated with the Sci-Fi London film festival, and True Love, billed as &quot;claustrophobic, dramatic and a little bit sinister&quot;, was premiered on the National Film Theatre&apos;s main screen. Over the years I have grown to associate a screening at the BFI South Bank with the very best in filmmaking. In my subconscious True Love was pitted against other first-time features  movies so outstanding they have shaped the craft, such as Citizen Cain, Knife in the Water, The Maltese Falcon, Eraserhead, Twelve Angry Men, The Kid, and The Night of the Hunter. High in claustrophobia, drama and malevolence, these films are damn hard acts to follow, but True Love isn&apos;t even good enough for the NFT&apos;s cutting bin. I guess it&apos;s possible that had the premiere been in a filthy garage in Deptford I might have liked the film more.            Watch Robots of Brixton on YouTube But my evening was not without entertainment, because two shorts accompanied True Love and the animated Robots of Brixton from London-based Factory Fifteen was really rather good. I will make a point of checking out their work in the future.",

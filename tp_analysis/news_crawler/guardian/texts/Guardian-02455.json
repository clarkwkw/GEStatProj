    "text": "Standing in the large square of this small town on the western end of the Cromarty Firth, I was almost engulfed by the cars and shoppers in the bustling thoroughfare. I was more interested in what was going on in the tops of the trees where the rooks were very busy with their spring nest maintenance. More than 40 nests are scattered across the area, with some along the main road running north. I saw at least two nests on their own, well away from the others as if they were outcasts. While the name for this collection of nests is a rookery, the loud, incessant calls explain the reason for another collective name: a clamour. A &quot;building&quot; of rooks refers to the building of the nests. At this time of year, the refurbishing of nests after the ravages of winter storms is paramount and birds were constantly coming and going. Incoming ones were often carrying twigs and were being greeted by birds on the nest with a variety of calls and postures. There was also another reason for so much calling: thefts were taking place. If a nest was left unattended for any reason, another bird would slip in, gather a twig, and simply transfer it to its own nest. This led to much raucous bickering when a culprit was seen and apprehended. In one incident two birds fought over the issue: in the struggle they tumbled down between the upper branches before the twig was dropped and lost to both of them, but honour had been satisfied. Then, without warning, the raucous calls intensified and, as if by a signal, every bird took off in a tight flock and flew upwards, almost in a spiral. It was eerie, especially when, for a moment, all calling ceased completely. Perhaps it was a buzzard or peregrine flying over that I could not see, but then the birds descended once again and normal activity resumed.",

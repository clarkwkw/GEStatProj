    "text": "The iMacs were barely out of their packing cases, the building was still being painted and at 8pm that evening the interactive whiteboard crashed  all our carefully prepared slides disappeared. Our first class was due at 10am the next day and Estelle Morris, then secretary of state for education, at 11am. As I looked out at the expectant year7s the following morning, I had a nervous twinge in my stomach. I took a big breath and smiled. Would this work? Would the pupils want to make newspapers and would they actually have done so by the time they left? We had started. It is 10 years this week since the Guardian Education Centre, funded by the Scott Trust, opened its doors and we taught that first class. Since then 85,000 visitors have participated in our workshops. While these have expanded both in terms of content and media, our visiting students&apos; desire to analyse, report, edit the news and produce newspapers is as strong as ever. As we found our feet, we progressed from focusing on producing and printing the front page to ensuring that workshops mirrored the real-life news day. Pupils have mini editorial conferences, choose their stories and then research and write them. They then take on editing roles  subbing, headline writing and picture selection, all to a tight deadline. And everything improved when we moved into the Guardian&apos;s new integrated office in Kings Place in 2009. Mark Payne, from Castle Rock school in Leicestershire, says his year 7, 8 and 9 students were &quot;wowed by the surroundings and much impressed by the facilities. It was motivating for them to see journalists working in the environment. Several of the children commented afterwards that as well as having had an enjoyable time, they now understood a little more of what the job of journalist requires.&quot; Many things have changed in the last 10 years  when we started the Guardian was predominantly a newspaper and now we are a multimedia company with a digital-first strategy. We have developed our programme to include history, science and environment newspaper workshops, feature-writing, podcasting and video-editing, as well as activities for higher education groups, adult learners, families and teacher training. But some things never change. When I was interviewed for Education Guardian during our first months, I explained that pupils enjoyed the sense of empowerment and independence in producing their own front page. Teachers told us that pupils who found concentrating in school really difficult rose to the challenge and loved it. This is still the case, and more so. In our world of 24-hour news, blogging and social networking, pupils want to learn how to be journalists, how to structure stories, and still, despite what we might have predicted, they want that physical front page in their hands at the end of the session. Teachers recognise that these transferable skills will equip older students to self-publish in whatever format or medium they choose. Nikki Olhausen, from Holmer Green school in Buckinghamshire, who has brought year 10,11 and 12 students says: &quot;We absolutely love the workshops. It is a superb way of ensuring that what we teach is in line with the reality of the world of newspaper journalism.&quot; Are pupils engaged with the news? Yes, they are. A recent year-8 class from Hampshire reported on the failed al-Qaida plane bomb plot, the Greek and French elections, willed the courageous Claire Lomas to finish the London Marathon after 16 days in time for their deadline and weighed up whether dinosaur flatulence causing prehistoric global warming or The Avengers film breaking US box-office records should go in their skyline. Pupils have responded brilliantly to the challenge of breaking news, from celebrating when London won the Olympic bid to covering political resignations, wars, earthquakes, famines, sporting victories against all odds and, in the case of one school from Norway, reporting about the volcanic ash cloud, which had grounded planes, while their teacher frantically researched an alternative journey home the next day. Although we get teachers to evaluate every visit, we rarely see how the newspaper workshop supports the curriculum. I recently visited St Jude and St Paul&apos;s primary in Islington and the deputy head, Joy Ashwin, explained how embedding the day in year-6 learning had raised achievement &quot;in a practical, realistic and meaningful way.&quot; The pages are &quot;displayed in our corridor and read by all, enthusing the following class who, in turn, look forward to visiting.&quot; Did that first class all meet their deadline and produce a newspaper front page? Yes they did, and the same school is coming back to the Guardian this week as part of our 10th birthday celebrations.  Margaret Holborn is head of the Guardian Education Centre.

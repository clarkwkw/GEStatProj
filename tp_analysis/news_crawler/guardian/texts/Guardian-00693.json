    "text": "Helen Czerski has the coolest job in science  shes a bubble scientist. Or, to give her her full title, shes a physicist and oceanographer at University College London. When shes not doing that, youve probably seen her on telly as a science presenter for the BBC. She has just finished her first book, Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life, and if thats not enough she also plays badminton competitively. Sitting at her kitchen table, just returned from a morning coaching session and still wearing her racket clubs black and red polo shirt, she laughs as the Observer opens with the obvious question Bubbles?Yeah, nobody quite knows what to make of it when I tell them, but theyre always interested. Bubbles are like the dolphins of the physics world, right? They make people happy. But scientifically theyre also fascinating. Theyre in champagne, theyre used in medicine, theyre in the ocean  theyre the unsung heroes of the physical world. This business of having two phases together  a liquid and a gas interacting  is such a useful thing. It gives you something that neither a gas or a liquid can do on its own.    As the sea ice retreats the Arctic Ocean is more exposed Id like to go and study the bubbles underneath breaking waves    Like what?Take the foam on top of a cappuccino. Its just milk and air. Put a spoon on top of a column of just coffee or just air and itll fall through, but whip them both up into a cappuccino and the spoon will rest on top. Understanding whats going on when bubbles form has all sorts of applications, like understanding how oceans breathe or how light and sound travel through oceans. Why do people need to know about the physics of everyday life? Isnt it just good enough to know that things work, like a smartphone?Its about knowing the rules of the world so you dont get exploited. Whether its a politician or a salesman, you need to know the rules theyre playing by. It doesnt mean you have to be an expert on weather systems or on double glazing or cars or mattresses or phones, but if you know the basics it gives you the confidence to ask the right questions. Say someone is trying to sell you a swanky smartphone case to make your reception better, or a magnetic bracelet they say will cure your wrist pain, you can ask well, how does it work? and if you know the basics you can tell whether they know what they are talking about or whether theyre just making things up.     A satellite image of the Arctic shows comparative ice melt: an opportunity for bubble research, says Czerski. Photograph: The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)    But a lot of people shun physics because it seems so complicated and irrelevant.I know. I dont think weve done a good job in talking about physics. People get the impression that its all about quantum weirdness or stars and time and the universe, but its also about quite basic things. Physics is about patterns that are folded into our everyday lives. Its much more accessible than people think and we should be telling them that. But nobody else is, so I am. Do you have an example from your book?OK. How about the way that tea sloshes around when you walk helping to explain why mobile phone signals dont interfere with each other? Tea sloshes at different rates in different size mugs, faster in little mugs and slower in bigger ones. The reason you spill tea when you walk is that it just so happens that the walking speed of a normal human is almost exactly the same as the slopping speed in your average mug. The walking speed exactly reinforces the slopping speed, so you spill the tea if you walk normally  walk slowly or with a tiny mug or a gigantic mug and you wont spill a drop. Mobile phone signals work on the same principle. Theyve each got a really precisely tuned resonance  or electron slopping rate  so that you can have two people sitting next to each other on two phones having two different conversations and they wont interfere with each other.    I see choosing to have an adventure as a rational decision, even though it might look irrational    Is there a tension between being a scientist and being a television presenter?The biggest tension is time. Its definitely more than one job, however you want to add it up. There are benefits: I learn a lot. Ive definitely met people and learned things that I otherwise wouldnt have if I stayed in my lab like a lot of scientists do. There are similarities between the two, too. The most important thing, whether its doing scientific research or presenting or writing, is understanding the situation clearly enough to be able to pick out exactly the right question. To organise all the ideas into a hierarchy and say: This [jabs at an imaginary point with her finger], this is the important thing that it all hangs on. It must be tough to make time for yourself?Not really. I manage to do some kind of sport  badminton or running or canoeing  almost every day. One of the things that I find mystifying is that people tend to think of scientists as somehow other, somehow alien. Ive sometimes not been invited to normal, mundane things that Id enjoy because people assume Im off doing something higher. Its true that I read a lot of books and play with ideas but the washing machine breaks for me, too! So whats your biggest non-science, non-sport guilty pleasure?I guess Im not allowed to say reading, am I? No.Erm chocolate. Dark chocolate with hazelnuts. Of what are you most proud in your career?Overcoming being extremely shy. I was too shy to speak as a child and its something I only really began to overcome around the time of my PhD [in experimental explosives physics at the University of Cambridge]. Academically, Im probably most proud of building instruments that go out into the open ocean and measure things that we have never been able to measure before. Theres something quite satisfying about drawing a ridiculous machine on a piece of paper and then a few years later having this monstrous thing sitting in front of you, pushing a button and it working. If money or logistics were not an issue, what would your dream experiment be?Id like to go to the Arctic and study the bubbles underneath breaking waves there. As the sea ice retreats the Arctic Ocean is becoming more and more exposed, so we need to understand better how gases and particles are exchanged across it. Bubbles are the vehicles that allow this exchange. Finding out what keeps us and our planet alive  and what might not keep us alive  is becoming increasingly important.   Related: Carlo Rovelli: Science is where revolutions happen    Science is all about evidence and acting rationally. What is the most evidence-free or irrational area of your life?I suppose Id say I was a compulsive opportunity taker. I see choosing to have an adventure as a rational decision, even though it might look irrational to others. So if someone asked you to go on a one-way trip to Mars to study bubbles you would go?I feel like Ive got a bit more living to do on Earth first. Anyway, nobodys solved the radiation problem yet. If they figured out a way to send people there without giving them incurable cancer then Id think about it. I reckon Ive got at least another two or three decades before it becomes a possibility. Hang on, are you saying that the Mars One expedition is not going to set up a colony on Mars by 2027 like they say they will?You see! Knowing some basic physics can help you make important real-life decisions.

    "text": "The name of the American wasp which travelled in cotton until it reached the neighbourhood of Oldham is Polistes, and the species is one which inhabits the cotton-growing States. It is a social wasp, differing little in its domestic life from our familiar wasps, but its nest is unlike any we know in England. Our wasps protect their cells from the weather by thin paper, which is however wonderfully weather-proof, but wasps of the genus Polisties leave the cells exposed and supply them with no protection. Four years ago, almost to the day, I received a wasp of this genus, though not of the same species, from Birkenhead, where it had been found walking about on a bale of cotton which had come from New Orleans. It looks as if these wasps got amongst the cotton when they wished to hibernate. What must they think when they find themselves roused from sleep in a foreign country!",

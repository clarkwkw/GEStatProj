Richard Peters, who took the shot, explains: 'Over the winter tens of thousands of knots spend the winter on the Norfolk coast at Snettisham. When there is a high tide the birds are forced off the mud flats where they fly in mass across to a lagoon where they spend time on the banks until the tide goes back out, at which point they return to the mud flats'Photograph: Richard Peters/Rex Features       A new miniature fish which was recently discovered 83km north of Surat Thani in southern Thailand. Measuring just 15-20mm, the species has been recorded at several spots within the lower Tapi river catchment. The fish is named after the large blotch on its body (the Latin naevus means blemish).

Bred in captivity, the tortoise, which is part of a breeding and repatriation programme, will eventually be released into the wild. The programme was created in the 1960s in response to dramatic reductions in the tortoise population due to the arrival of humans to the islands.

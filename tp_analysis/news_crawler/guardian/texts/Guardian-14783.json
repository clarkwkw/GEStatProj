    "headline": "Bee deaths: Should the EU ban neonicotinoids?", 
    "text": "  8.04pm BST       Some late comment...  Lord de Mauley, parliamentary under secretary at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra): Having a healthy bee population is a top priority for us but we did not support the proposal for a ban because our scientific evidence doesnt support it. Significant countries agree with us that a ban is not the right action to take and we will work with them to get much better evidence. We will now work with farmers to cope with the consequences as a ban will carry significant costs for them. Nick von Westenholz, chief executive of the Crop Protection Association: A ban on the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments would be unlikely to improve bee health, but would remove a key crop protection technology which is vital for economically and environmentally sustainable crop production in the UK and across Europe. Recent research suggests that banning neonicotinoid seed treatments could cost the UK economy up to 630m. The Commissions decision to press ahead with a ban, without a political mandate and on poor scientific evidence, placing perception of hazard before evidence of risk, sets a potentially damaging precedent for EU regulatory decision-making. It also sends an extremely negative signal to R&amp;D-based companies across the European agri-food sector. This decision is also directly at odds with the objectives set out for the UK governments planned Agri-Tech Strategy, which seeks to boost the production efficiency and competitiveness of UK producers. Removing key technologies such as this without sound scientific evidence isnt a good place to start. Extensive scientific and field-based evidence points to the Varroa mite and parasitic diseases, combined with the problems associated with habitat loss, colony stress and climate change, as the key factors implicated in declining bee populations. The crop protection industry recognises the critical importance of bees as pollinators for agriculture and food production. It is vital that the causes of bee health problems are properly understood, and our industry actively supports ongoing research and stewardship programmes aimed at protecting bee health. Campaigns to blame the nearest chemical must not deflect research effort and resource away from these environmental, pest and disease issues which together present the major underlying challenges to bee health.        5.09pm BST    My verdict    The European Commission was right, I believe, to have ordered the suspension of neonics across Europe for two years starting this coming December. Arguments will no doubt continue about whether there was &quot;enough&quot; scientific evidence to support such a ban. But, as I argued last month, there are times when the precautionary principle has merit - and this is one of those occasions. We have grown crops without neonics before, so a two-year pause will clearly not interrupt our food production system significantly, as some are trying to suggest. And the fate of bees is rather more important than the quarterly profits of a handful of corporations. What is really important now is that governments, scientists and all other stakeholders work hard over the next two years to gather as much robust and diverse data as possible so we can better answer the question at hand when the suspension draws to a close in late 2015. There are still some niggling questions: Is two years long enough to gather such data? Will farmers use a more harmful replacement during the ban? But today has seen a common-sense response to an environmental problem. How often can we say that?       4.57pm BST       Some more expert comment...  Dr Nigel Raine, reader in animal behaviour at Royal Holloway University of London: The weight of peer-reviewed scientific evidence suggests that field-relevant exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides can have adverse effects on bees. Whether this moratorium will benefit bees depends on what alternative methods of pest control are used instead. If the ban results in greater use of crop sprays the net result could be worse. More research is needed to determine if this will be the case.  There is a clear need to monitor bee populations carefully during the two year moratorium to see whether they bounce back when these three neonicotinoids are not being used. We also need to check the residue levels of these chemicals in the soil which could persist from crops sown this spring or earlier. Bees are actually exposed to multiple pesticides when they forage in the field. The risk assessment for pesticides needs to take into account this type of combinatorial exposure as well as potential sublethal behavioural effects and longer term (chronic) impacts. Insects provide essential pollination services worth at least 440 million to UK agriculture each year. Pesticides are a critical tool to achieve high levels of crop production. Both have clear benefits, so we need to ensure that pesticides are used in ways that minimise any detrimental impact on insect pollinators. Dr Chris Hartfield, National Farmers Union&apos;s lead on bee health: The Commissions decision to ban three widely used neonicotinoids is likely to have catastrophic impacts for food production and unintended consequences for the environment, without delivering any measurable benefits for bee health. It is right that we take steps to protect bees  they are vital pollinators, but, any action needs to be proportionate to the problem. Crucially, we have to be confident that when we make changes, these changes will actually deliver benefits. At the moment, there is no evidence to show that there are any harmful effects of neonicotinoids on bees under field conditions. If we cannot find evidence of harm in the field, then it follows that we will not be able to measure any benefits of a ban either. This issue is about science and evidence, and finding a balanced way to tackle the significant challenges to bee health. However, it looks like we are about to make populist changes that do nothing to measurably improve the situation for bees, but will make it harder and more costly for farmers and growers to control pests on a whole range of agricultural and horticultural crops. Alison Benjamin, co-author, A World without Bees: In 2008, I called for neonics to be banned using the precautionary principle. A World without Bees - the book I co-wrote that investigated why the bees were disappearing - found that while there was no proof then that the pesticides were to blame for high bee mortality, and colony collapse disorder, not enough research had been done to prove they weren&apos;t harming bee colonies. This is a landmark moment. Let&apos;s hope that the appropriate tests can be carried out during the EC&apos;s 2-year ban.        4.16pm BST       Still more reaction arriving...  Ellie Crane, the RSPB&apos;s policy officer leading on pesticides: The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the evidence on neonicotinoids and found unacceptable risks and serious gaps in data. The ban is the right course of action under the precautionary principle. It is now vital that the next two years are used wisely to fill in the evidence gaps and monitor the impacts of the ban - including the use of alternative pesticides - on populations of pollinating insects. Critically, there should be a push to develop and promote safer alternatives to neonicotinoids  including non-chemical techniques...We are disappointed that the UK did not support the ban. However, we hope that our government will now strive to get the best result for UK farmers: helping them manage pests successfully and safely as part of wildlife-friendly systems of farming, without need for neonicotinoid pesticides. Prof David Goulson, professor of biological sciences at the University of Sussex: There is no evidence that the withdrawal of these compounds will have significant negative impacts on farming. It is high time we returned to Integrated Pest Management (IPM) - an approach focussed on minimising pesticide use, maximising the number of biological control agents, using cultural controls such as crop rotations, and monitoring pest numbers so that chemical controls only need be applied when there is a problem. Instead, neonicotinoids are applied prophylactically, much like taking antibiotics to avoid getting ill - and this use on crops such as wheat will continue after the partial ban. This is a recipe for environmental damage and the evolution of resistance in pests. Keith Taylor, Green Party MEP: Its great news that Europe is set to go ahead with a suspension of neonicotinoid use but its no thanks to the reckless actions of the UK government. Despite a growing body of evidence on the serious impact of these pesticides on bees, the UK government has, once again, failed to support a suspension of their use. Instead of defending the short-term interests of the agro-chemical industry, the British government should have prioritised reversing the decline in our bee populations and voted in favour of a suspension. For Greens, the suspension proposed by the Commission is only a first step. We want a complete ban of all neonicotinoids to prevent the collapse of bee colonies as only a full ban will stop the exposure of non-target insects to the persistent, systemic compounds that stay in the soil and find their way to nectar and pollen over many years. Friedhelm Schmider, director general of the European Crop Protection Association: We are deeply disappointed by this decision. Independent monitoring studies in a number of EU member states have clearly documented that when used correctly neonicotinoid insecticides have no impact at all on bee populations. Recent findings have confirmed that both beekeepers and laboratories see pesticides as a minor cause affecting bee health, far behind diseases and parasites.        3.58pm BST       Here is the reaction of Georgina Downs from the UK Pesticides Campaign:  There is a much wider issue here that is completely being missed by so many parties. The serious problems from the use of pesticides in agriculture and the impacts on bees, other pollinators, as well as importantly on humans, is definitely not limited to just one group of pesticides, the neonicotinoids (neonics). The reality is that there is a whole cocktail of pesticides used in food production every year. In fact there are approx. 2,000 pesticide products currently approved for use in the UK in agriculture, according to the governments regulators for pesticides. Eighty per cent of pesticides used in the UK is related to agriculture use, according to the Chemicals Regulation Directorate).In relation to the exposure to bees to pesticide mixtures, there have been some studies regarding this. For example, a US study in 2010 highlighted the potential synergistic effects on bee health from mixtures and combinations of different pesticides as the researchers found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Therefore aside from the numerous individual products that carry warnings of a risk to bees on the product label and safety data sheet information (such as harmful, dangerous, extremely dangerous or high risk to bees), there will also be the risk of adverse impacts on bee health from the cumulative effects of multiple exposures to mixtures of different pesticides.The current UK policy and approach regarding pesticides fundamentally fails to adequately assess the risks of such exposure (ie. to mixtures of pesticides regularly sprayed), to any species whether it be humans, bees, or other.Further, successive governments have failed to act on known risks and adverse impacts, especially on human health. For example, it is now beyond dispute that pesticides can cause a wide range of both acute, and chronic, adverse effects on human health. The European Commission has previously clearly acknowledged that, long term exposure to pesticides can lead to serious disturbances to the immune system, sexual disorders, cancers, sterility, birth defects, damage to the nervous system and genetic damage&quot;. Yet the UK government has not, to date, acted to protect citizens from the known risks and adverse impacts of pesticides.The economic costs of the health conditions that pesticides can cause are massive. Obviously, it goes without saying that the personal and human costs to those suffering chronic diseases and damage, and the impacts on all those around them, cannot be calculated in financial terms.It is clear that the very serious and inherent problems that result from using pesticides will definitely not be solved by merely tinkering with the existing system. There needs to be a complete policy shift away from the dependence on pesticides altogether by utilizing sustainable non-chemical farming methods. Therefore it is a complete paradigm shift that is needed to a non-chemical food production system, as no toxic chemicals that have related risks and adverse impacts for any species (whether humans, bees, birds, or other) should be used to grow food.        3.45pm BST       The Guardian will have an updated news story live on the website soon. But here&apos;s a preview of some of the views contained within:  Greenpeaces Doug Parr said: By not supporting the ban, environment secretary Owen Paterson has exposed the UK government as being in the pocket of big chemical companies and the industrial farming lobby... A spokesman for Syngenta, which makes one of the three neonicotinoids suspended, said: The proposal is based on poor science and ignores a wealth of evidence from the field that these pesticides do not damage the health of bees. The EC should [instead] address the real reasons for bee health decline: disease, viruses and loss of habitat... Bayer remains convinced neonicotinoids are safe for bees, when used responsibly and properly, said a spokesman for Bayer Cropscience. As a science-based company, Bayer is disappointed that clear scientific evidence has taken a back-seat in the decision making process.&quot;        2.58pm BST       The Science Media Centre has gathered together some reaction from scientific experts...  Dr Juliet Osborne, Environment &amp; Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter: If a moratorium goes ahead, it is crucial that two things take place at the same time to ensure the debate can be properly informed. First, the ongoing review of the pesticide regulatory process must be completed to ensure it is fit for purpose to assess the safety of systemic pesticides. Second, a monitoring scheme of wild and managed bees must be set in place to provide evidence as to whether the moratorium is correlated with changes in foraging bee numbers and bee colony mortality. It would also build a fuller picture if we were able to monitor the effect of such a moratorium on farmers and their crops. Whilst not giving direct evidence of cause and effect, such monitoring of bees would fill crucial gaps in the evidence base at the landscape scale, and would be valuable to assess what happens if the moratorium were lifted in the future. A national monitoring scheme like this would also contribute good evidence to future debates about environmental impacts of land management on bees. Norman Carreck, science director of the International Bee Research Association, University of Sussex: It is not yet clear what the implications of this moratorium will be. There has been concern about this class of insecticides ever since they were introduced twenty years ago, yet many experiments and wide-scale studies in many countries over the years have failed to demonstrate harm to bees in the field. This being the case, it will be very difficult to demonstrate any benefits to bees of a moratorium in just two years. If the purpose of the two years is to enable scientists to gather definitive evidence of the effects in the field, it is hard to see how can this be done if fields will no longer use treated seeds. I am also concerned about whatEnvironmental Impact Assessment has been carried out to evaluate the effects on bees of the use of alternative pest control measures that willfollow this moratorium.Neonicotinoids will inevitably be replaced by older compounds. Just as we lack knowledge of the subtle sub-lethal effects ofneonicotinoids in the field, we know little about these other compounds either, because historically the registration process has not focussed on these aspects. Dr Lynn Dicks, research associate at the University of Cambridge and NERC Knowledge Exchange Fellow: This is a victory for the precautionary principle, whichis supposed to underlie environmental regulation. Scientific evidence is unclear about the role neonicotinoids play in causing declines in bees and other flower-feeding insects. They are probably one of many interacting threats,so abroader approach to protecting insects would be better. But neonicotinoidsare one factor that MIGHT be causing a serious problem. The precautionary principle sayswe should err on the side of caution andstop using them while we find out more. I hope the EU Member States will now consider monitoring patterns of pesticide use moreclosely. Prof Lin Field, head of biological chemistry and crop protection at Rothamsted Research: We are concerned that the decision has been made through political lobbying, rather than a comprehensive and sound scientific risk-benefit assessment. There are many other factors known to affect bee colonies - the varroa mite, the bee viruses spread by the mites, pesticides that beekeepers use to kill the mites, climate effects and flower and nectar availability - all of which need to be taken into consideration. Thinking we can solved the bee problem by a ban on neonicotinoids may mean we overlook these other important factors. Whats more, the decision does not take account of the risk of the ban on our ability to control insect pests and secure crop yields. Securing, and indeed increasing yields for food security, is a priority in Europe and will require a crop protection strategy to avoid unnecessary losses. At present and until we find reliable and effective alternatives, the control of insect pests (and the crop diseases they carry) will rely on the use of chemical insecticides and banning neonicotinoids will reduce our options. A major biological risk of removing an entire chemistry is that resistance will develop against the remaining products. This is exactly what has happened in human health with bacterial antibiotic resistance. Or are we willing to accept lower yields, leading to greater imports and potentially higher food prices? The UK has already become a net importer of wheat this year for the first time in a decade. It has also been reported that a ban on neonicotinoids could result in a significant impact to UK oilseed farmers, costing the UK economy 630m each year. That said, we should not ignore the potential implications of pesticide use on pollinators. Rather than an immediate ban, we should take this opportunity to further study and de-convolute the many possible causes of colony collapse and aberrant foraging behaviour. This will then help us to balance the risks and benefits for crop protection, crop pollination, ecosystem function and our health appropriately.        2.51pm BST       Farmers Weekly has a quote from Luke Gibbs, spokesman for Syngenta UK, which manufactures a neonicotinoid called Cruiser for use on oilseed rape, fodder rape and mustard:  The European Commission has again failed to win the necessary support for its proposed ban on this vital technology. The ban has been wrongly presented as a silver bullet for solving the bee health problem. The proposal is based on poor science and ignores a wealth of evidence from the field that these pesticides do not damage the health of bees. Instead of banning these products, the commission should now take the opportunity to address the real reasons for bee health decline: disease, viruses and loss of habitat and nutrition.        2.35pm BST       The European Commission has just issued the following press release:  Today, EU Member States did not reach a qualified majority  either in favour or against - in the Appeal Committee An appeal committee is a committee comprised of EU-27 high level representatives and is convened when a standing committee of Member State experts fails to reach a qualified majority. which discussed a Commission proposal to restrict the use of 3 neonicotinoid insecticides. Tonio Borg,Health and Consumer Commissioner, said: &quot;Although a majority of Member States now supports our proposal, the necessary qualified majority was not reached. The decision now lies with the Commission. Since our proposal is based on a number of risks to bee health identified by the European Food Safety Authority, the Commission will go ahead with its text in the coming weeks.&quot; To conclude: &quot;I pledge to do my utmost to ensure that our bees, which are so vital to our ecosystem and contribute over 22 billion annually to European agriculture, are protected.&quot; 15 Member States supported the restriction, 8 Member States voted against and 4 Member States abstained during the appeal committee vote. Main elements of the proposal The proposal restricts the use of 3 neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiametoxam) for seed treatment, soil application (granules) and foliar treatment on bee attractive plants and cereals. In addition, the remaining authorised uses are available only to professionals. Exceptions will be limited to the possibility to treat bee-attractive crops in greenhouses, in open-air fields only after flowering. The restrictions will apply from 1 December 2013. As soon as new information is available, and at the latest within 2 years, the Commission will review the conditions of approval of the 3 neonicotinoids to take into account relevant scientific and technical developments. Next steps In absence of an agreement between Member States, it is now for the Commission to decide on the adoption of the proposed restriction.     Updated at 2.36pm BST     2.30pm BST       An email has just arrived from a reader called Nicholas O&apos;Brien. He raises an interesting question:  I am delighted at the ban but have a concern. How long does it take for neonicotinoid pesticides to become fully removed from the ecosystem? (via biodegradation or otherwise). If it is around 2 years, then I fear the chemical companies may (wrongly) try to argue neonicotinoids are innocent.  If anyone has any thoughts or evidence regarding this point please do let me know, or post a comment below. On a related point, I&apos;m also curious to know whether a two-year suspension is enough time to gather enough &quot;with/without&quot; evidence to move this debate forward definitively. Again, please send in your thoughts and evidence.       1.42pm BST    Twitter reaction    Here is some of the reaction coming in via Twitter...    #bees #neonics looks like deadline for ban has moved from 1 July to 1 Dec to give time for implementation. sensible&mdash; Damian Carrington (@dpcarrington) April 29, 2013     Efforts by the UK and @uksciencechief to thwart #neonicotinoid ban have failed.

Here&apos;s a quick flavour...  Andrew Pendleton, Friends of the Earths head of campaigns: This decision is a significant victory for common sense and our beleaguered bee populations. Restricting the use of these pesticidescould be an historic milestone on the road to recovery for these crucial pollinators. But pesticides are just one of the threats bees face - if David Cameron is genuinely concerned about declining bee numbers he must urgently introduce a Bee Action Plan. The UK government&apos;s refusal to back restrictions on these chemicals, despite growing scientific concern about their impact, is yet another blow to its environmental credibility. Ministers must now help farmers to grow and protect crops, but without relying so heavily on chemicals  especially those linked to bee decline. Simon Potts, professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services at the University of Readings School of Agriculture, Policy and Development: This is excellent news for British pollinators. The weight of evidence from researchers, including those at the University of Reading, clearly points to the need to have a phased ban of neonicotinoids; something which the recent Environmental Audit Committee report called for. It is frustrating that Defra has sat on the fence by abstaining from the last vote, and forced the European Commission to take the lead by imposing a moratorium. Few people would disagree that we need to protect our food production, but it shouldnt be at the cost of damaging the environment. Indeed, there are several alternatives to using neonicotinoids, and other pesticides, and this a great opportunity for farmers to adopt these practices to protect bees and other pollinators. Indeed farmers will benefit from healthy pollinator populations as they provide substantial economic benefits to crop pollination. A short-term decision to keep using harmful products may be convenient, but will almost certainly have much greater long-term costs for food production and the environment.        1.16pm BST    Vote result    The result of the vote is now in, and here&apos;s the Guardian&apos;s news story:  Europe will enforce the world&apos;s first continent-wide ban on widely used insecticides linked to serious harm in bees, after a European commissionvote on Monday. The landmark suspension is a victory for millions of environment campaigners concerned about dramatic declines in bees who were backed by experts at the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). But it is a serious defeat for the chemical companies who make billions a year from the products and also UK ministers, who both argued that the ban will harm food production... The vote by the 27 member states of the European Union to suspend the insect nerve agents was supported by most nations, but did not reach the required majority under EU voting rules. However, the hung vote hands the final decision to the European commission (EC) who will implement the ban. &quot;It&apos;s done,&quot; said an EC source, indicating that a formal announcement on the ban is expected within weeks.        12.59pm BST       Interpreting what is exactly meant by the term &quot;precautionary principle&quot; is key to this issue, as noted in the Observer yesterday:  &quot;It&apos;s a landmark vote,&quot; said Joan Walley MP, chairwoman of parliament&apos;s green watchdog, the environmental audit committee, whose recent report on pollinators condemned the government&apos;s &quot;extraordinary complacency&quot;. Walley said: &quot;You have to have scientific evidence, but you also have to have the precautionary principle  that&apos;s the heart of this debate.&quot;  It&apos;s interesting to see that the European Commission even has its own definition and webpage devoted to the term:  Common guidelines The precautionary principle shall be informed by three specific principles:  the fullest possible scientific evaluation, the determination, as far as possible, of the degree of scientific uncertainty; a risk evaluation and an evaluation of the potential consequences of inaction; the participation of all interested parties in the study of precautionary measures, once the results of the scientific evaluation and/or the risk evaluation are available.  In addition, the general principles of risk management remain applicable when the precautionary principle is invoked. These are the following five principles:  proportionality between the measures taken and the chosen level of protection; non-discrimination in application of the measures; consistency of the measures with similar measures already taken in similar situations or using similar approaches; examination of the benefits and costs of action or lack of action; review of the measures in the light of scientific developments.  The burden of proof In most cases, European consumers and the associations which represent them must demonstrate the danger associated with a procedure or a product placed on the market, except for medicines, pesticides and food additives. However, in the case of an action being taken under the precautionary principle, the producer, manufacturer or importer may be required to prove the absence of danger. This possibility shall be examined on a case-by-case basis. It cannot be extended generally to all products and procedures placed on the market.        12.43pm BST       Earlier this month, Damian Carrington - the Guardian&apos;s head of environment, who has covered this issueextensively - wrote a blog post examining the science, economics and politics that make &quot;this tale&quot; so &quot;complex&quot;. He began with the available science, having first spoken to Prof Ian Boyd, the chief scientific adviser to environment secretary Owen Paterson:  Boyd assessed the balance of scientific evidence by comparing three semi-field studies showing harm (there are more) with five field studies, suggesting no harm (refs 1-8 here). He raised questions about the doses used in the former studies, but you should note that all three were published in the world&apos;s most prestigious peer-reviewed journals, Science and Nature. Of the five opposing studies, one was the government&apos;s own catastrophic research where the supposed control hives suffered serious neonic contamination. That&apos;s not surprising, given that neonics are the most widely used insecticides in the world but I will be surprised if the work ever passes peer review. &quot;It is extremely difficult to have a control in a landscape where neonicotinoids are widely used,&quot; said Boyd, highlighting the very problem a suspension would solve. Another of the five studies Boyd cites was done by a contract research organisation and also remains unpublished in a journal or even online. The three remaining studies do appear in second or third rank journals, but even then one was funded by the German agrochemical industry. To me, the balance of quality research points clearly to unacceptable harm, the same conclusion reached by the independent experts at the European Food Safety Agency. Boyd did criticise the chemical companies making the neonics for not publishing their own data: &quot;I believe all those data should be open access, everyone should be able to see them. There are issues of intellectual property and commercial confidentiality but I don&apos;t think they are insurmountable.&quot; He also criticised the lack testing for bee harm over the last 20 years of neonic use: &quot;I don&apos;t think it is acceptable. We should have been testing for these kinds of effects right from the beginning.&quot; However, when asked whether there were any upcoming studies that could tilt the fine balance one way or the other, he said: &quot;I don&apos;t know of one in the pipeline that is going to address the question we need addressed.&quot; That makes a mockery of Paterson&apos;s repeated plea to wait for more research before taking any action.        12.24pm BST       The UK government - and its new chief scientific adviser, Sir Mark Walport - very much take the view that a temporary ban on neonics would be misguided, as Damian Carrington reported on Friday:  Plans to ban insecticides linked to serious harm in bees across Europe would be a &quot;serious mistake&quot; and could harm food production, according to the government&apos;s chief scientific adviser. Sir Mark Walport&apos;s strident defence of the government&apos;s opposition to the proposed ban came on Friday as hundreds of beekeepers and environmental campaigners marched on parliament in protest and delivered a petition signed by 2.6 million people to the prime minister at No 10 Downing Street. &quot;This plan is motivated by a quite understandable desire to save the beleaguered bee and concern about a serious decline in other important pollinator species,&quot; Walport wrote in the Financial Times. But Walport, who is just a month into the job, said the European commission must drop its proposal to suspend three neonicotinoids from use on flowering crops, such as corn, that bees feed on: &quot;The consequences of such a moratorium could be harmful to the continent&apos;s crop production, farming communities and consumers.&quot;  Meanwhile, a letter sent by Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, to the biotech multinational Syngenta just last week - released to the Observer under freedom of information rules - reveals the true extent of the UK government&apos;s opposition to any ban. There is a clear philosophical difference between the European Commission - which favours the precautionary principle in this instance - and the UK government which wants to &quot;finish the science&quot;.       10.59am BST    Welcome to the Eco Audit    An EU vote is taking place in Brusselstoday which could lead to the controversial group of pesticides called neonicotinoids - or &quot;neonics&quot; - being suspended for two years due to concerns about their impact on bees. The first such vote in March failed as the majority needed to implement a ban was not reached. However, the European Commission took it to the appeals committee, leading to today&apos;s vote. A hung vote would be enough for the commission to force through the suspension it seeks. There has been intense lobbying from both sides. Environmentalists want the ban because they are concerned about the impact of neonics on fast-declining bee populations across Europe. They insist the latest scientific evidence supports their case. Meanwhile, farming groups and pesticide manufacturers say that the evidence linking neonics to the decline of bees is limited and that neonics are now essential to modern food production. Please leave your own thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict.    ",

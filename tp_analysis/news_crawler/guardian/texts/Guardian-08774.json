    "text": "Games company King.com&apos;s roots are in casual skill-games, where players could compete for cash and prizes as well as for fun. However, its recent growth has come from Facebook, without the prizes but with social features. Mobile is its next frontier. In the last couple of years, King.com has grown from being the 40th most popular games developer on Facebook to second place behind Zynga, with 49.6m monthly active users (MAUs) and 11.9m daily active users (DAUs) at the time of writing. &quot;Just as we could see the Facebook games audience growing two years ago, the mobile games audience is now growing as well,&quot; says Alex Dale, chief marketing officer at King.com. &quot;Delivering casual social games on mobile is absolutely something we&apos;re focused on.&quot; The first fruits of this strategy came with the launch of Bubble Witch Saga for iOS in July 2012, which synchronises players&apos; progress with the Facebook version so they can continue their game across devices. Is the game doing well? King.com isn&apos;t giving figures, although the App Store charts reveal that Bubble Witch Saga is the 131st Top Grossing iPhone app in the US, but 28th in the UK. These chart positions don&apos;t tell the whole story people playing heavily on their iPhones or iPads may well be spending money within the Facebook version of the game. It does show that King.com&apos;s challengers on mobile go well beyond Zynga, though, with freemium games by independent developers like Supercell (Clash of Clans, Hay Day), Kabam (Kingdoms of Camelot), NaturalMotion (CSR Racing) and Backflip Studios (DragonVale) all riding high on the App Store. Dale hopes that King.com&apos;s focus on casual social games will bring it mobile success comparable to its growth on Facebook, particularly in the UK, where he points to research by the Internet Advertising Bureau claiming that 80% of the adult population consider themselves to be gamers. &quot;It&apos;s now so mainstream, with one thing that has made it mainstream being Facebook in terms of bringing a female audience into gaming, and then mobile bringing an adult audience,&quot; he says. &quot;Both of those groups are looking for something easy to pick up and play, which doesn&apos;t require hours of practice or a whole load of grinding for cities, castles or farms. They want something quick and puzzle-oriented. That trend has been behind the growth of King.com on Facebook, and obviously the mobile versions of these games play to the same background.&quot; So what next, following Bubble Witch Saga? King.com has a healthy pipeline of games thanks to its main website, which maintains a constantly-refreshed roster of 150 games. Dale says that the ones that are most popular will be considered for rebuilding as &quot;Saga&quot; games for Facebook, with additional content and social features. &quot;Hopefully they&apos;ll grow a happy and engaged audience on Facebook, and then once they&apos;ve done that, we&apos;ve got an audience that we can help to launch the game on mobile,&quot; he says. Which suggests Candy Crush Saga  15.1m MAUs on Facebook  may be heading mobile-wards in the coming months. Dale praises Facebook&apos;s mobile efforts for app discovery, which are pointing more of its 543m active mobile users to native apps for their iOS and Android devices from within their newsfeeds. &quot;It&apos;s a hugely valuable discovery mechanism,&quot; he says. Meanwhile, King.com is exploring ways to make money on mobile beyond pure in-app purchases, although Dale says the company isn&apos;t currently looking to bring the skill-gaming model across from its original business. Instead, King.com is trying its &quot;incentivised video&quot; ads on mobile devices, which offer gameplay boosts such as extra lives in return for watching a video ad. Dale says it&apos;s also looking at brand promotions &quot;where a brand might sponsor boosters or elements of the gameplay&quot;. The company is also considering its strategy for taking games to Android devices, with Bubble Witch Saga already available in the US for Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire tablet. King.com has also dipped its toes in the waters of web-apps, making an HTML5 version of its Pyramid Solitaire Saga game. Still, the company&apos;s focus remains on mainstream players. &quot;The Facebook games audience has broadened away from a very-strongly resource management-oriented audience to something that&apos;s mainstream and interested in casual games,&quot; says Dale. &quot;If you look at some of the all-time top-performing games on iPhone and iPad, starting with Angry Birds, you find that they are casual formats as well. And mobile is one of the fastest-growing areas by revenue for the games industry as a whole.&quot;",

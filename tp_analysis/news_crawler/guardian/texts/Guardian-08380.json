    "text": "A new 18,000-a-year private university headed by the philosopher AC Grayling and offering lectures by Richard Dawkins, Niall Ferguson and Steven Pinker has not filled any of its courses ahead of its opening next week. The New College of the Humanities is still offering undergraduate places in economics, English, history, law and philosophy with just days to go until it opens in Bloomsbury, central London. It has recruited only a third of the students it intends to have in each year group. The numbers suggest NCH, which has been established as a for-profit private company, will run at a significant loss in its first year. Backers of the college include the City financiers Howard Leigh and John Singer, as well as Charles Watson, chairman of the PR firm Financial Dynamics. With others, they are understood to have provided support of about 10m. When Grayling launched the college last year as a commercial alternative to Cambridge and Oxford, which are up to five times oversubscribed, the plan was to attract 200 students a year with teaching staff who would include some of the most famous academics in the UK and US. In April, Grayling was reported as saying that the overall intake in September would be &quot;no more than 180 to 200&quot;, but in advance of next Monday&apos;s opening the NCH confirmed that only 60 students were expected to take up places this term. Grayling had said that students and their parents would consider 54,000 for a three-year University of London degree good value for money, despite this sum being double the fee charged by the University of London&apos;s own colleges. He said: &quot;There&apos;s a quarter more content, contact with some rather distinguished people, and preparation for professional life.&quot; But the low take-up could prove embarrassing for some of the high-profile teachers who signed up. They include the Booker prize-winning novelist Howard Jacobson and the Princeton history lecturer Sir David Cannadine. Lawrence Krauss, professor of earth and space exploration and physics at Arizona state university, who has advised Barack Obama on science policy, is to teach cosmology and science literacy, and the leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson is a visiting professor. Grayling said on Tuesday that he was very happy with the number of students presently enrolling. &quot;Sixty students in our first cohort is ideal. This founding group of students, similar in size to that of a small Oxbridge college, will receive an individual experience.&quot; They would &quot;form our founding clubs, societies and union, which will be built on in years to come&quot;, he said. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, the largest trade union for lecturers, said the numbers suggested it would &quot;take more than occasional appearances from academics off the telly to justify the enormous price tag&quot;. She added: &quot;Perhaps unsurprisingly, charging fees of more than double humanities courses at established institutions does not appear to be the way to open the subject up to more students.&quot; Students at NCH will follow syllabuses matching those taught in University of London colleges and will have to sit exams in the university to gain their degree, said Jonathan Kidd, dean of the University of London&apos;s international programme. With the student numbers as they stand at present there will be more than one teacher for every two students. About 20 students will be on assisted places, either paying no fees at all or 7,200. If half of those were on full scholarships, NCH would have an annual income of about 800,000, from which it would pay a teaching staff of 36, and cover the cost of premises at Bedford Square, London, and the tens of thousands of pounds in fees to the University of London to which the students are registered. &quot;We are not disappointed,&quot; said Watson, the college&apos;s chairman. &quot;It is not above expectations, but it is where we thought we would be. We were really a bit late getting to the sales process by launching last June. People are starting to take a view on where they are going to go in the lower sixth form. So the second year is a really key test because we will be able to engage with students at an early stage.&quot; NCH had 445 applications and offered places to 112 candidates. Watson said most of those who turned down their offer did so after securing places at Oxford and Cambridge, where the fees are 9,000. He denied price was an issue with any of those who opted to go elsewhere and said some chose American universities where the fees might be higher than at NCH. Liam Burns, general secretary of the National Union of Students, called NCH a vanity project: &quot;It is no surprise that students are failing to sign up. Our research shows that students value teaching ability and interaction with other students and academics over inaccessible star names with a mountain of publishing credits.&quot;",

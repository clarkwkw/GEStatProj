    "text": "It will make uncomfortable reading for ministers, but the House of Lords report on the national strategy to speed up and extend Britain&apos;s broadband network should be taken very seriously. If implemented, the practical suggestions it offers could unleash a wave of new money to help the many remote communities desperate to come online do so more quickly and in greater numbers than is likely under current plans. Broadband for all  an alternative vision is the result of a six month inquiry by the Lords communications committee which took in evidence from regulators, technicians and companies ranging from BT to tiny community projects such as Great Asby Broadband in Cumbria. And the conclusion is that the government is not being bold enough. The current target of getting speeds of 24Mbps to 90% of the country by 2015 or 2017  the deadline date is unclear  may assure more bandwidth than most households need today. But the rate at which the internet has evolved in the past, with demand doubling every year or two, suggests the average home will need two or three times that speed come 2020. To deliver ever faster connections, the Lords committee has concluded that different technologies will be needed than the ones currently being paid for by the government and installed by BT. And it is worried about the final 10% of homes, the hardest to reach in the UK. It is far from certain that the government will achieve its target of giving these rural locations a minimum of 2Mbps. And that minimum only just meets the needs of the average household today. It will not be enough by 2015 for home workers, or for families raising teenagers doing their homework, watching video and calling friends on Skype. The 2Mbps figure was chosen because it is the minimum needed to deliver internet TV, but that is already changing. TalkTalk&apos;s budget YouView internet TV service, launched towards the end of July, will require a minimum 3Mbps connection. Despite an elaborate bidding process, which at one point involved nine separate companies, it currently looks as if only BT will emerge victorious in the competition to grab a share of the 530m of government funds earmarked for rural broadband. Even with government help, BT is not guaranteed to reach everyone. An alternative is needed. Under the current rules, communities can build their own broadband networks, but they have to hand ownership to BT if they want to be able to plug into its exchanges. This is obviously a major disincentive to private investment. With the system of &quot;fibre hubs&quot; being proposed by the Lords, communities could build and own their own network, and plug them into BT&apos;s at a set price using standard technology. Under such a system, smaller companies could offer to build local networks around the country, creating economies of scale. This would, of course, see BT lose its monopoly control of the connection from telephone exchange to household in many rural areas. Is this something ministers should worry about? BT has promised to match every pound invested by the government with its own money, and spend 2.5bn rolling out fibre to the easiest to reach two thirds of the UK without subsidy. This is a big commitment, and one BT might pull back from if the competitive landscape changes. BT is working fast. It has already upgraded 11m of the UK&apos;s 26m homes with fibre to the street cabinet. But under current plans, for years to come, much of its broadband network will still rely on old copper wires to carry the signal from the cabinet to the home. Copper often fails in poor weather, leaving rural users without service for hours at a time. It also slows speeds down. And it cannot carry signals over a long distance, leaving remote homes relying on basic dial-up internet. The reality is that we will eventually need to replace every copper wire with fibre, a process that one research firm says could cost as much as 30bn. BT cannot be expected to foot the bill alone, but this fact should not halt progress. Other money needs to be found, and the fibre hubs proposed by the Lords communications committee are a pragmatic way of attracting new investment. The government should respond to the committee&apos;s call for it to study the cost of building these hubs, and ask those companies receiving public money to build them. The importance of the internet to the UK&apos;s economy cannot be understated. It already generates a greater proportion of GDP. The national broadband strategy should give the UK the network it needs.",

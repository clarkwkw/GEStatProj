    "text": "After barely a year, Nintendo is already upgrading its 3DS handheld with a supersize model. While the company is known for updating kit  it did so several times with the Game Boy and DS  the 3DS XL isn&apos;t the big leap forward from the original that many gamers were expecting. Instead of major new additions, the console features a number of tweaks  the battery life is longer, the stylus is now easier to reach, a new hinge means the screen can be locked in two places (which is a godsend for long Kid Icarus sessions) and it feels more comfortable to hold, despite being heavier. It also looks sophisticated  more like a gadget and less like a toy. As the name suggests, the big change is the 90% larger screen. This makes a difference during action-packed sequences in the likes of Resident Evil: Revelations. The downside to this is that graphical imperfections are more noticeable (especially in the Mario games). However, the visuals have more room to breathe. Existing fans may see little point in upgrading, but XL is the model to choose for 3DS newcomers.",

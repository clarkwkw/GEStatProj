    "headline": "Media studies hit by film charity closure", 
    "text": "I am appalled to learn that Film Education, the charity that provides curriculum-based teaching resources, teacher training and cinema-based events across the UK, has closed (Report, 23 April). Film Education has been a vital resource for me during seven years heading a media department at an outstanding north London comprehensive girls&apos; school. Every September I launch the Young Film Critic of the Year Award as part of my induction into the UK film industry and introduction to journalism courses. In October I take my AS and A2 students in lesson time to National Schools Film Week, an astonishing network of morning film screenings that take place for a fortnightthroughout the whole of Britain. While my daughter&apos;s Lambeth primary class  many of whom have never been to the cinema before  were watching A Shark&apos;s Tale in Leicester Square, my AS students attended a marketing event on Dear Wendy and my A2 students were unravelling depictions of torture with Danny Boyle before a screening of Slumdog Millionaire. In November the DVD InsideView case study of The Boat That Rocked popped into my in-tray in time for a showing of the film. In spring I attended a teacher&apos;s conference with inspiring talks by producer Paul Trijbits (Jane Eyre, This Is England, Andrea Arnold&apos;s films) and the head of marketing of The Woman In Black. And how much did Film Education cost the government? Nothing. It was funded by the film industry. &quot;Film Education closes&quot; could equally be an epitaph for media education in schools.

    "text": "If you happen to suffer from insomnia, tonight&apos;s the one time you can count your lucky stars  right as they fall from the sky. The Quadrantid meteor shower, the first of 2012, will be in full swing between 3am and dawn Wednesday morning eastern time. If you&apos;re unlucky enough to be a sound sleeper, you might want to set your alarm to catch nature&apos;s fireworks display. The show will be brief, but intense  on a clear night the Quadrantid ranks among the most spectacular meteor showers. With good visibility, enterprising early risers could catch between 60 and 200 meteor streaks an hour. Discovered in the 1830s by Adolphe Quetelet of the Brussels Observatory and named after an obsolete constellation, the Quadrantid meteor shower occurs regularly, every time our planet passes through the narrow trail of debris left by an asteroid called 2003 EH1. The silvery-streaks of the Quadrantid shower can be tough to see when the moon is bright and the sky is cloudy. Fortunately, star gazers have a cool, clear night to look forward to. So bundle up and enjoy the show.",

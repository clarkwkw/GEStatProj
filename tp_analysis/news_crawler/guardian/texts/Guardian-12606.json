    "text": "The muggles &quot;Nichi and I were both doing our PhDs at Manchester when we met. The somewhat improbable catalyst was a shared interest in dissenting Christianity, specifically Muggletonianianism  though perhaps not that surprising, as we work on Blake and Milton respectively. &quot;As we worked in a large shared office, a quick discussion of dissent over coffee soon blossomed into regular lunches, and we finally got together in September 2011. That was about eighteen months after our first meeting, but through that time we were bonding over academia  I got her through a marking panic, she taught me better ways to read and teach poetry. &quot;Ultimately, we ended up editing each other&apos;s thesis, and I deferred so we could graduate together. Despite the stress of finishing within six months of each other, being able to share what we were doing, and help and guide each other through the end of that process, made our relationship much stronger. We still edit each other&apos;s work (including this piece!), and she still tells me off for using too many commas, subclauses and historical &apos;anecdotes&apos;. I don&apos;t think we&apos;d have the relationship we do without the academic side of things  it&apos;s amazing how much trust and intimacy can be built through such an abstract pursuit.&quot; Liam Haydon is an associate lecturer at Lancaster University. Nichi McCawley is studying for a PGCE at the University of Bristol. The poets     Photograph: JT Welsch    &quot;Organisers for an upcoming conference emailed to ask if I could also chair a panel. I jumped at one with a paper on my favourite poet, John Berryman. My future partner&apos;s paper really was brilliant, although her PhD supervisor, who was in the audience, later joked about the panel chair who embarrassed himself with so many fawning questions. At the pub gathering afterwards, we exchanged email addresses on the pretence of sharing some archival photos she had used. &quot;A few months later  I&apos;d say by chance, but I only signed up because she mentioned it  we had a week together at the TS Eliot Summer School, passing notes during talks on Dante and strolling in the gardens at Burnt Norton (&apos;unheard music hidden in the shrubbery&apos;, etc.) It was as geeky as it sounds from the start, I&apos;m afraid, including a racy online debate about the &apos;prickly pear&apos; in &apos;The Hollow Men&apos;. But maybe it also left us resolved against Eliot&apos;s &apos;what might have been&apos;. &quot;In any case, we&apos;ve been terribly lucky since, both finding lectureships in Yorkshire (she at Sheffield, me at York St John), where we&apos;re still sharing photos for lecture and now raising a very literary dog.&quot; JT Welsch is a lecturer in creative writing and English literature at York St John University.

The experimenters     Photograph: Ruth Allen    &quot;Neil and I met in 2010 when he started his PhD at Lancaster University. I had completed my PhD from the same department and related research group and was researching in a different department when he arrived. I had heard rumours of a new man in town, and tried to get the gossip on what he was like, which was met with a non-descript &apos;he seems normal&apos; (praise indeed). &quot;When we finally crossed paths in a college canteen and he was introduced to me as PhD-alumni from his office, it was clear we would hit it off. The deal was sealed at a friend&apos;s S&amp;M/M&amp;S themed PhD submission party, and the rest was history. Neil is now in the final stages of his PhD and I manage the graduate school including the research training programme. I like to feel that this makes me his boss, and I am sure he would be too scared to disagree. &quot;He&apos;s my ear on the ground for what the students think , but he&apos;s still too scared to attend any of my courses. Still, no matter  when we get home I get on at him about writing up, so he doesn&apos;t get special treatment. Working in the same institution is brilliant; it gives us a great quality of life together and mutual understanding of each other&apos;s perspectives on both sides of the coin. We&apos;re getting married this year and it makes me laugh (Neil less so) that I will technically be Dr Slatcher before he is!&quot; Ruth Allen is the graduate school administrator in the faculty of science and technology and Neil Slatcher is a PhD student at Lancaster University The graduands     Photograph: Melanie Rimmer    &quot;I vaguely knew Andrew, having seen him around our department, but I was in the final year of my PhD and my mind was on other things! He was doing a history PhD, I was in archaeology, so our paths didn&apos;t cross much  he claims we once had a conversation at a post-grad conference, but it was two weeks before I submitted, and I don&apos;t remember it at all. &quot;It wasn&apos;t until our PhD graduation that we met properly. He was easy to spot in his red gown, and I was glad to see a familiar face. We helped each other to adjust our robes and our parents took photos, then we walked down to the hall together. With consecutive surnames in the alphabet, we ended up sitting next to each other during the ceremony, which gave us plenty of time to bond over the shared woes of PhD life and a love of old buildings. &quot;By the time the four-hour ceremony was over, I knew that something important had happened. Eighteen months later, we got engaged. I&apos;ve always thought that graduation ceremonies are long and somewhat tedious affairs, but in this case, it was a good thing.&quot; Melanie Rimmer is a post-doctoral researcher and Andrew Richardson postgraduate pathways officer in the school of history, archaeology and religion at Cardiff University.

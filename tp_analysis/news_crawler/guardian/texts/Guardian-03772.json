    "text": "Starhawk, PS3 Starhawk is a spacefaring wild west story complete with dusty frontier towns, sheriffs, freighter robberies and its own gold rush (in this case prospecting for crackling blue &quot;rift energy&quot;). You play Emmett Graves who, especially when wielding a pistol, looks quite the outlaw himself, albeit one with glowing veins and eyes after too much contact with rift energy. Your job is to cap energy wells you find with sci-fi drilling rigs, while defending them from Scabs, the game&apos;s generic piratical foe. Doing so blends traditional over-the-shoulder shooting action with a bit of tower defence, in that Graves can call in satellite drops of anything from walls to laser turrets, garages and launch pads. Those last two are particularly important because Scabs have access to the same vehicles and aircraft you do, taking combat into space in the build-up to the game&apos;s final showdown, which arrives after a measly six hours or so. It&apos;s fun, but even with multiplayer to spice things up, Starhawk&apos;s a slight game. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, 49.99 Datura, PS3     Datura    You wake up in an ambulance, your disembodied hand first letting you sweep off your blanket, then pluck the heart monitors off your chest, causing a paramedic to try and defibrillate you. Regaining consciousness in a strange forest, you have to work out what on earth is going on by slow exploration and clumsy interaction via a spooky floating hand. Primarily designed for PS Move, Sony&apos;s answer to the Wii&apos;s motion control system, you can also use a joypad, although both prove frustrating. Moving is like walking through glue and even while feverishly tapping the run button it feels like trying to run in a dream. With a swelling orchestral score and an environment that responds to the choices you make, Datura is peppered with good ideas, but the control method often interferes with this intriguing three-hour mini-adventure. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, 6.49 PSN Download Games news     Akai Katana    Keith Vaz MP has been making noises about video game censorship again, this time inspired by Anders Breivik&apos;s testimony that he played World Of Warcraft and Call Of Duty, two of the biggest-selling entertainment products in human history. If they do indeed turn people into sociopaths you&apos;d have to admit that only converting one, given the games&apos; reach of tens of millions, doesn&apos;t really make them a threat worth legislating against  The &quot;Transmedia&quot; adventure game Alt-Minds has been announced for a release this autumn, promising to involve players in new and dramatic ways with its detective fiction  And after the monumental success of Skyrim and past Elder Scrolls games, a massively multiplayer online version of its world is on its way  Also out this week is Akai Katana (Xbox 360), Cave&apos;s latest foray into bullet hell.",

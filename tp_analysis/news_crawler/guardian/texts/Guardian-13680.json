Google, destroyer of ecosystems &gt;&gt; cortesi Aldo Cortesi:   Google has finally shut down a service I actually care about - Google Reader will die a graceless, undignified death on July 1, 2013. The only way Google could inconvenience me more would be to shut down search itself, and yet - I&apos;m not angry that Google is shutting Reader down. I&apos;m furious that they ever entered the RSS game at all. Consider this quote from a TechCrunch article in January 2006. Here, Michael Arrington ends an article about the shutdown of a feed reader service with a statement that seems truly bizarre today:   The RSS reader space is becoming hyper competitive, with dozens of different choices for readers.  ... In the next few months, tens of thousands of small blogs will lose direct contact with a large fraction of their readers.  No longer. Although things might start happening between now and July. The 400lb gorilla has gone elsewhere. Mobility is reshaping consumer gadget spending and behaviour &gt;&gt; Gartner  The Gartner survey was conducted during July and August of 2012 and included responses from more than 8,000 consumers in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). &quot;Early adopters tend to leave the home laptop in the bag and are abandoning the home office in favor of the lounge room couch or bedroom to do online activities in a more comfortable environment using a tablet or smartphone,&quot; said Nick Ingelbrecht, research director at Gartner. &quot;This early adopter trend is becoming mainstream consumer behavior. Consequently, technology and service providers are faced with no alternative but to innovate for mobility. If they do nothing, they face a potential train wreck as consumers abandon gadgets, services and applications that do not fully support changing mobile lifestyles.&quot;  Tablets have overtaken netbooks and e-readers in the sample. BlackBerry brings business services to iPhone and Android &gt;&gt; PC Pro  A new app from BlackBerry will allow users to securely separate work and personal data on iOS and Android-powered devices. Secure Work Space will be available before the end of June, and will allow corporate users of BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 to handle devices using non-BlackBerry operating systems. The move will encourage business customers to continue to use BlackBerry&apos;s services to manage devices on their networks, even if employees use them as both business and as personal devices.  Neat idea, but does it signal a retreat, or just a redoubt, from the handset business? It also puts BES up against companies such as Airwatch and Citrix, which offer similar products. Apple, Samsung, challenged by cheap Chinese Android phones &gt;&gt; MIT Technology Review  The change began in 2011, when computer-chip makers began selling off-the-shelf chipsets  the set of processors that are the brains of a touchscreen phone. Those, plus Google&apos;s free Android operating system, made smartphones much easier to produce. The flood of inexpensive devices could hurt struggling phone makers like Nokia and might also force Samsung and Apple to offer cheaper models. &quot;They have reached their peak,&quot; Liang said during an interview near his office in Shenzhen, which has become a hub for electronics makers. &quot;In [manufacturing] technique we are close to the same level. Then the only difference will be the cost and the brand.&quot;  Note that though they&apos;re Android phones, they generally don&apos;t have Google services. How the Technology Strategy Board spent 635 million  company by company &gt;&gt; Business Leaders Network  Hats off to Lyndsay Williams at Girton Labs who has used the Freedom of Information act to see how the Technology Strategy Board has allocated 635 million of public funding to projects. This will be interesting reading if you want to consider applying as you can now see exactly what is funded, by company, by project, by date and by amount.  Also has the salaries (2010) for the Technology Strategy Board senior staff, as at November 2010. The TSB is hard to find out about because parts of it aren&apos;t accessible for FOI requests. EU privacy watchdogs tell app developers and app stores to take care of users&apos; data&gt;&gt; Computerworld  New recommendations from Europe&apos;s top privacy watchdog could have big ramifications for Google Play, Apple and application developers. The Article 29 working group, which is made up of data protection authorities from across the European Union, has issued fresh guidelines for mobile phone applications. The overall principle of data minimization - only collecting the data strictly necessary for the app to operate - is the cornerstone of the group&apos;s recommendations. However, according to Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, there is much confusion in the market, and in February, Christopher Graham, the U.K.&apos;s Information Commissioner, said that some app developers had a &quot;cavalier&quot; attitude to personal data protection.  The principal aim is to stop people being tracked by &quot;advertisers and any other third party&quot;. Not sure where Google fits into that. Google takes harsh stance against ad-blocking apps, removes them from Play Store &gt;&gt; Phandroid  According to several sources, Google has started sending notifications to developers with ad-blocking software in the Google Play Store regarding these apps&apos; removal. Players like AdBlock, AdAway, AdFree and more are being whisked away. So why, exactly, is Google bringing the ban hammer down on these unfortunate souls? Well, they seem to violate section 4.4 of the Play Store developer agreement.  More precisely, it violates Google (and others) making money from ads. What would be the reaction if news sites refused to serve news to people who use ad-blockers (as Ars Technica once did)? This is the same. Why is Google killing Google Reader? &gt;&gt; Quora Brian Shih, former Google Reader product manager:   Let&apos;s be clear that this has nothing to do with revenue vs operating costs. Reader never made money directly (though you could maybe attribute some of Feedburner and AdSense for Feeds usage to it), and it wasn&apos;t the goal of the product. Reader has been fighting for approval/survival at Google since long before I was a PM for the product. I&apos;m pretty sure Reader was threatened with de-staffing at least three times before it actually happened. It was often for some reason related to social:2008 - let&apos;s pull the team off to build OpenSocial2009 - let&apos;s pull the team off to build Buzz2010 - let&apos;s pull the team off to build Google+ It turns out they decided to kill it anyway in 2010, even though most of the engineers opted against joining G+.  Google+ is the giant sucking sound at the heart of Google.

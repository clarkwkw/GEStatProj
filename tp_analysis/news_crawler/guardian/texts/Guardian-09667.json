    "text": "It was the game that broke a thousand joysticks and now it&apos;s coming for your iPad: Daley Thompson&apos;s Decathlon is back. Developer Black Company Studios has produced a new version for touchscreen devices, featuring all the classic events and spruced up visuals. Originally released on the Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad computers back in 1984, the game challenged players to compete in a series of athletics events by waggling a joystick or hitting keys to increase Thompson&apos;s speed. It was part of a craze for joypad-hammering action kicked off by Konami&apos;s arcade classic, Track &amp; Field. But timed to cash in on the LA Olympics, the Daley Thompson title, published by Manchester firm Ocean, caught the imagination of British kids  much to the annoyance of parents who had to pay out for new joysticks when over-enthusiastic armchair competitors broke them. The new version gets players to tap two different virtual buttons on the screen to compete - which sounds substantially less damaging. Favourites like the 100m sprint, long jump, shot put and high jump are all included, and there&apos;s social connectivity so you can bombard your friends with high scores on Facebook and Twitter. They&apos;ll love that. &quot;I have often said if I had a pound for everyone who comes up to me in the street and says they loved the game but almost wore out their computer joysticks or fingers playing my decathlon game in the &apos;80s I would be a millionaire,&quot; said Thompson, who has apparently advised on the new version. &quot;It felt right this year with the Games in London to bring it back out for phones and tablet computers  I loved playing it then and am getting pretty good at the new version!&quot; The game is out now on iOS and Android for 1.49. I was more of an Epyx Summer Games 2 man, myself...",

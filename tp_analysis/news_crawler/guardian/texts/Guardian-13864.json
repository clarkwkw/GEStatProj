    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view With no plot and tutorials so perfunctory they&apos;re practically nonexistent, Monster Hunter 3 is a game unswervingly focused on stalking prey, ranging from man-sized lizards to hulking leviathans. Unlike most games of its ilk, you can&apos;t level up, relying instead on crafting weapons and equipment to improve your character&apos;s chances against the game&apos;s more lethal beasts. Similar to 2010&apos;s Monster Hunter Tri, this one adds underwater combat and lightly refreshed visuals, although playing on Wii U, the fuzziness of its visuals is all too reminiscent of a GameCube game. On 3DS things look better, and you get the same game on both systems, with the ability to transfer your save between them. Monster Hunter 3 is at its best taking on one of the game&apos;s towering predators with a team of human adventurers, but it takes a time to discover why this inscrutable game is so popular in Japan.",

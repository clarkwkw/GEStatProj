    "text": "What would your school do with 5,000? On Tuesday, the Guardian and Zurich Municipal are launching a competition to encourage students and teachers to work together to develop an idea that would have a positive impact on school life. Whether it&apos;s from the school council, form groups, school societies, individual classes or groups of classes, and beyond, we want to hear your ideas for how you would use 5,000 to change your school for the better. The competition, called The School We&apos;d Like, is open to any school in Great Britain and there are three categories  primary, secondary and special  with a 5,000 first prize in each. Entries do not have to conform to a single type. They could suggest physical improvements within the school: sorting out the playground; something that benefits the culture of the school, such as an anti-bullying campaign; or an idea that develops parental engagement in learning. It is up to the school community to choose. To enter, all we need from you is a brief outline of your school&apos;s idea, how it would improve school life, who it would benefit and how you would use the 5,000 prize money to put the idea into action. At this stage, we just need a written outline, but at the final, to be held at the Guardian offices in London, representatives from 10 shortlisted schools will present their idea to a Dragons&apos; Den-style panel of judges. Here, you can use videos, podcasts, models, even dance, to convince our judges that your school should win the 5,000 prize. Finalists will also be invited to spend time in the Guardian&apos;s education centre where young people are taught the basics of journalism. All entrants will receive a certificate and there will be trophies for the shortlisted finalists. We&apos;re also going to publish the shortlisted entries on the Guardian Teacher Network to spread good ideas among schools. The three overall winners will be featured in a supplement in the newspaper. We&apos;ve created some teaching resources to help you come up with a cracking entry. These include brainstorming sessions and conversation starters around the meaning of sustainability. We&apos;ve also compiled some tips on pitching your idea and editing and redrafting your proposal. You&apos;ve got until 17 December to get your entries in. So tell us about the school you would like  you could make it happen.

The original gave the closing date for the competition as 10 December. Since the article was written, the closing date has been extended to 17 December.",

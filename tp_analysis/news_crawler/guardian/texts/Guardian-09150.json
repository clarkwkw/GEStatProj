    "text": "Resident Evil 4 was seen by many as the high point for Capcom&apos;s lumbering horror franchise; the fifth instalment dipped. Now, number six lurches along, promising a return to form. Instead, it delivers a curious &quot;best of&quot;, an assemblage of the series&apos; most popular moments with a heavy focus on multiplayer. I found the constant push for co-op rather distracting, confusing even. Launch one of the three starter campaigns (one each for returning heroes Leon and Chris, and a third for newcomer Jake) and you&apos;re asked to choose between controlling the title characters or their partners. Then, in what for all purposes is a multiplayer lobby screen, you&apos;re nudged to invite someone to control the remaining figure. It takes a moment to realise that pressing the start button places the secondary characters under AI  not a terribly clear interface at all. But the real problem comes when you enter the game itself. Whatever pretensions of horror remain in Resident Evil&apos;s spent cadaver are thoroughly eviscerated by the mere presence of a support character. You&apos;re not alone, ergo you&apos;re not afraid. Action replaces terror, most sections becoming brutal shootouts with strings of headshots. Barrelling through the three male leads&apos; stories unlocks a fourth, that of femme fatale Ada Wong. Much closer to classic Resi, Ada&apos;s solo adventure more authentically captures the isolation and fear of earlier games, with some appropriately challenging puzzles. However, the 15 hours you&apos;ll need to devote before experiencing it may prove off-putting. There are high-points  the bioterrorism plot is as delightfully twisted as any before, and putting together the full narrative chronology through each campaign elevates it to something greater than the sum of its parts. Overall though, the piecemeal approach taken by Resident Evil 6 makes it more of a Frankenstein&apos;s monster than a zombie opus worthy of Romero&apos;s  or even original creator Shinji Mikami&apos;s  legacy.",

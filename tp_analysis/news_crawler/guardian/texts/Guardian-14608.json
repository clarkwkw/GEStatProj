    "text": "It was a true-life drama in the making: a paraglider pilot who had taken off from the top of Latrigg and flown over Keswick&apos;s rooftops suddenly appeared above the trees, dropping like thistledown towards the town&apos;s rugby ground. The purple-and-red canopy pushed downhill as if by a sudden downdraught. Skiddaw soared majestically on one side, while snow-laced Grisedale Pike with its elegant knife-edge arte rose imperially skywards across the way, sandwiching the bottle-green oasis inbetween. Archers, meanwhile, were releasing high-velocity arrows at targets set up along the pitch, unwittingly in line with the unsuspecting pilot&apos;s touchdown. Action stations! It had been such a clement morning: pale-blue skies and wisps of cloud, alpine hills and bare trees looking like broomsticks planted handles first into the ground. And now? Crisis beckoned. The farthest target, almost a full pitch&apos;s length from where the archers stood, posed the biggest threat. The two bowmen who were firing at this substantial board would periodically troop up from near the goalposts at the caravan park end of the ground, first inspecting the ground beyond the target for near misses and then returning to extract the arrows that had hit home. One arrow was lodged so securely that they could extract it only by pulling with all four hands to heave the recalcitrant missile out. Now they had returned to the firing line and were poised once again with their long bows drawn as the unexpected visitor suddenly appeared, dropping swiftly out of nowhere. At the last moment, the pilot pulled out in a swift soaring turn that swung the canopy away and skimmed nearby treetops to drop safely in the field beyond.",

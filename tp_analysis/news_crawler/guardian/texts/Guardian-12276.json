    "text": "The education secretary asserts that &quot;real&quot; A-levels (Gove&apos;s bid to grab headlines will narrow pupils&apos; learning, 28 January) engender a mysterious property known as &quot;deep thought&quot;. There are many reasons why this isn&apos;t the case. First, each subject has a syllabus that states what will be taught and examined; this immediately limits the field of enquiry. Second, there has been a reduction in teaching time allotted to A-levels, leading to more cramming and stockpiling of &quot;correct&quot; knowledge. Third, it&apos;s an examination, not a programme of learning. A-levels are very good at excluding inquiring minds and those who ask challenging questions and at encouraging conformity; as Nell Keddie suggested in 1971, &quot;It would seem to be the failure of high-ability pupils to question what they are taught in schools that contributes in large measure to their educational achievement.&quot; Peter ScalesDerby It is claimed that to get into Russell Group universities sixth-formers need to have grades of AAB in three &quot;facilitating&quot; subjects at A-level  maths, further maths, the three sciences, history, geography or a classical or modern foreign language. That 23.4% of schools, offering A-levels do not have any students achieving this outcome (Report, 25 January) was used to suggest that there is a serious failing in sixth-form provision. In fact it has never been the case that three of these so-called &quot;facilitating&quot; subjects are necessary for entry to our top universities. Unless their criteria are about to change (in which case could they tell us before the next generation of sixth-formers is advised?), it has always been the case that two of them are required. Otherwise someone who wants to read music at Oxford should not do music at A-level, or economics is not a relevant A-level for PPE at university. The claim that a quarter of our A-level providers are failing by this measure is unfair. Many schools in very challenging circumstances have developed sixth forms to cater for students whose university and career aspirations lie elsewhere  in the 300 other institutions that offer degree courses. These students are well served by staff who work very hard on their behalf. Their task of now having to implement yet another wholesale revision of the post-16 curriculum is not made easier by damning them with false claims and statistics. Peter RawlingBracknell, Berkshire The AS examinations Michael Gove wants to abolish have widely benefited students, schools and universities (Report, 24 January). Students have been able to begin sixth form with four subjects (or more), then in the second phase focus on their core three; and year 12 examinations have been a good preparation for later A-levels. Schools have valued the flexibility and additional structure of the system. Universities have been able to offer places on the basis of higher-level, if intermediate, exam results. The idea that removing AS will increase rigour, by concentrating minds on an end-of-course, make-or-break final exam, is a fond fiction, as those of us who knew the old system are well aware. Mr Gove&apos;s move appears calculated to reduce opportunity, narrow the sixth-form curriculum and make entry to higher education more of a lottery. In brief, there is no educational case for it. Rev John Caperon Former head, Bennett Memorial diocesan school, Tunbridge Wells, Kent When A-levels were taken at the end of sixth form, 20% or 30% would fail individual subjects and thus would have effectively wasted two years of their life. The current modular system enables those who are struggling with A-levels to make an informed choice about whether to continue after a year, and helps universities make offers based upon actual results at AS, rather than what are often inflated predicted grades. End-of-course exams are risky and many working-class pupils are likely to think them too risky, especially if their family has little history of academic success. So if Gove wants an education system that wastes people&apos;s time and taxpayers&apos; money, emphasises failure rather than success, undermines fair selection for university places and narrows rather than widens participation, he is going the right way about it.Martin HolbornCarnforth, Lancashire Where are parents&apos;  and indeed students&apos;  voices in this sea of change that constitutes our education system? Among the barrage of initiatives introduced in less than three years, I have not once seen reference to any consultation with the key stakeholders. It is destabilising for young people to be uncertain about the hoops they will need to jump through to enable them to move on to the next stage of education, training or work. Surely those in receipt of a public service should have a say in shaping it? As things stand in education, they don&apos;t really know what that service is, let alone how to contribute to any dialogue about how it might be improved.Fiona CarnieParent Councils UK  Apart from the highly contentious objectives of Michael Gove&apos;s proposals, their sheer number and timing should be ringing alarm bells throughout the high command of the coalition. If we only lived in a democracy, all the main partners would have to be consulted  teachers, parents, employers and students. In our elective dictatorship, successive secretaries of state since 1988 have simply imposed their policies on those who must enact them. In doing so, however, they fatally weaken any claim they have to democratic legitimacy.Frank CoffieldEmeritus professor of education, Institute of Education, University of London This year, just 38% of the independent Westminster school&apos;s year 13 managed A-levels in &quot;facilitating subjects&quot;. Oddly, that didn&apos;t stop half of them being offered places at Oxbridge (the highest percentage of any sixth form in the country). Today&apos;s universities aren&apos;t looking for the narrow education that created Gove.Lisa FreedmanChief executive, At the School Gates",

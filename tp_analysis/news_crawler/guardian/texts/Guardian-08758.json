    "text": "In April last year, I was thrilled to catch up with my old education sparring partner Mike Baker at a reception for our ex-Guardian colleague Donald MacLeod, who had been seriously injured when he was knocked over by a police car. Mike cheerfully chaired a panel discussion of education correspondents as they were subjected to a grilling by public relations executives. It was only later that I learned that on that very same day, Mike had received his devastating diagnosis of lung cancer  which was to claim his life at the end of last week. It was typical of Mike to carry on in this way: professional, kind, self-effacing and loyal. Mike continued writing his regular column for Education Guardian  and his award-winning cancer blog until he was too sick to carry on. I never heard anyone, in education or in journalism, say a word against him. Michael Gove, education secretary It is incredibly cruel that Mike Baker has died so young. His family have lost a wonderful man, admired by everyone he knew. Mike was the authority figure in education journalism  respected by other professionals for his attention to detail, fair-mindedness and his passionate engagement with his subject. His reporting helped millions to appreciate what we owe to teachers and the way in which great teaching can transform lives. For those of us involved in policymaking, the Baker test was the toughest  what would Mike think of our ideas? No other education journalist was as scrupulous, original or penetrating. His reporting was informed by deep knowledge and sound judgment, his analysis was always balanced and agenda-setting. Mike bore his illness with great dignity and it is deeply saddening to see him taken from us so prematurely.  Estelle Morris, education secretary (2001-02) Mike Baker was quite simply one of the best education journalists in the country. The relationship between politicians and journalists is a strange one. Politicians have their views about the journalists who report them favourably and those who don&apos;t. It would never have entered your mind to think of Mike in this way. He always reported things just as they were. He was a specialist journalist and knew the area better than most politicians. I have more than once turned to his words in an effort to better understand what was happening. Mike was a lovely human being. He was thoughtful, never seeking the limelight, trustworthy and reliable. Education and journalism have a great deal to thank him for. David Puttnam, chancellor of the Open University; founder of the Teaching Awards Mike&apos;s early death is not only tragic for the family he adored, and the multitude of friends and colleagues who admired and respected him, but it is also an incalculable loss to the world of education in general. That&apos;s a big claim, but in Mike&apos;s case it is justifiable because, in a sector that is capable of being as fractious as it is fractured, Mike was a much-needed and consistent source of knowledgeable, non-ideological common-sense. Mike was an early enthusiast and supporter of the national Teaching Awards and eventually he became a highly influential judge. His written assessments of some of the eventual award-winners are impeccable models of affectionate enthusiasm for a profession he both loved and understood. John Dunford, former general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders Mike Baker was the ultimate professional in journalism  able to convey a story accurately, fairly and concisely, drawing on his encyclopaedic knowledge of education policy. Being interviewed by Mike was always a pleasure. He was genuinely interested in what you had to say. His quiet, incisive questioning was never angled, but he would helpfully draw out the interviewee. I recall his inaugural lecture as a visiting professor at the Institute of Education in London, in which he lifted the lid on the secrets of BBC reporting. How did he do it day after day, often at incredibly short notice? Here was a man at the summit of his profession, who always remained a friendly, approachable human being without a grain of arrogance or self-promotion. David Bell, vice-chancellor, University of Reading I was first interviewed by Mike just after I took up my post as chief inspector of schools in England. In the article that followed, he described me as resembling Mr McKay, the ferocious Scottish prison officer immortalised by Fulton McKay in the BBC comedy series Porridge. For a good while afterwards, that was how I was introduced as I travelled around the country. Over the years, Mike proved to be an incisive analyst and commentator. When I was permanent secretary at the Department for Education, I used to tell him  and not altogether jokingly either that officials would read his weekly BBC blog to have ministers&apos; policies explained to them. The serious point, and the mark of Mike&apos;s writing and reporting, was his ability to explain even complex issues in a simple but not patronising manner. Already, we miss the distinctive voice of reason and common sense that Mike Baker so personified. The world of English education will be all the poorer without it. Chris Woodhead, former chief inspector of schools; professor of education at the University of Buckingham Soon after Ron Dearing took responsibility for the reform of the national curriculum in the early 90s, he turned to me over a cup of coffee and said: &quot;Why is it that the world of education is so nasty? I&apos;ve worked in many areas of public service and I&apos;ve never come across so much animosity and resentment&quot;. He paused, and then added: &quot;But there&apos;s one exception. That BBC correspondent, Mike Baker. He is a real gentleman.&quot; He was right. Mike must have interviewed me scores of times during the 1990s. He was never anything other than cheerful, courteous, well informed and utterly professional. I suspected, as I got to know him, that, deep down, we probably didn&apos;t agree on what needed to be done to raise standards in English schools, but he never for one moment allowed his personal views to intrude. He knew that a good journalist honoured the distinction between comment and reporting above all else. David Blunkett, secretary of state for education (1997-2001) Mike Baker was not only one of the nicest journalists I ever met, but one of the most through and reliable. He mixed a total commitment to his love of education with a journalistic eye for detail. He could distinguish between trendy clap-trap and genuine innovation and newsworthy development. He will be sorely missed. Christine Blower, general secretary, National Union of Teachers Mike Baker was a journalist of great integrity and knowledge who was genuinely insightful and humorous. Speaking to Mike was always a pleasure; there was never an interview with him when he didn&apos;t burst into a smile, which immediately had me doing the same. There are very few people who, unless teaching is their profession, had the understanding that Mike did. Mike Baker was a genuine seeker of the truth and he believed that everyone involved in education should be given the space to express their views. His death is a great loss to education. Matthew Lumby, former director of communications, Ofqual  I worked with Mike for over 10 years, starting with me as a very junior press officer and Mike as a very senior BBC correspondent. He was never anything other than a pleasure to work with, always polite and understanding. Future historians who want to understand the last few years in education could do no better than to look through Mike&apos;s columns and his own excellent blog. His ability to make the complex sound simple was extraordinary. Many politicians and senior officials would read Mike&apos;s commentaries in much the same way that an actor would wait for theatre reviews. A thumbs-up from him was hugely prized. Professor Alan Smithers, professor of education, University of Buckingham I first met Mike in the late 1980s at a college in deepest Surrey, where I had been booked to speak. At the end I was very surprised when, out of the throng, a very pleasant young man came up and introduced himself as the BBC education correspondent. On hearing I had come from London by public transport and taxi, he offered to drive me back. When I hesitated because I thought he was just being polite, he pressed me, and nearly a quarter of a century later I can recall the exciting conversation we had about education as we sped along. From then on our jobs continually brought us into contact. I was always pleased to receive a call from him because he was so knowledgeable and prepared to listen to evidence on its merits. Because he seemed to know more about education than anyone else I knew, I sometimes turned to him, and he always responded promptly and helpfully. I followed his cancer blog to the last. His carefully documented struggle has caused me and, I am sure, many others to think carefully about the nature and purpose of their own lives. You cannot leave a greater legacy than that. Stephen Twigg, shadow schools minister and former school standards minister (2002-5) Mike was a true giant of education journalism  calm and rational, but also passionate about tackling inequalities. Over the past two years, his writing has offered an intelligent critique of Michael Gove&apos;s policies. I first met Mike when I was at the National Union of Students over 20 years ago, but I got to know him best when I was an education minister. He combined an incisive intellect, a passion for education and a non-partisan approach. As we debate some of the big challenges facing education policy in the 21st century, his insightful analysis will be missed sorely. John Bangs, former head of education at the National Union of Teachers I was lucky enough to meet Mike regularly when he was BBC Education Correspondent. He seemed to be there with his TV crew at every big press conference and education event. Like everyone, I was always taken aback by his knowledge of education. After Lord Dearing was called in to pull the first national curriculum out of the fire in 1995, I remember being interviewed by him and he seemed to have an encyclopaedic acquaintance with its programmes of study, attainment targets and levels of attainment. Talking to him, it was always self-evident that he was on the side of the good guys  always thinking about how education could best help all young people. He was open to ideas whichever party or person they came from. He was alert to every morsel of news, however inconsequential. My strongest memory is of him interviewing me outside the Sage Centre in Gateshead at the NUT&apos;s Easter conference. It was cold and raining and I had a dreadful cold. His job was to coax something useable out of me by showing an intense interest in what I had to say! He was sympathetic, alert, knowledgeable and professional; the antithesis of the interviewer who arrives with a piece of paper, a couple of general points and zero knowledge of the subject. It seems to me that is how Mike will be remembered. He was totally committed to education, a true professional and a great person. Fiona Millar, founder of the Local Schools Network I last saw Mike when he came to interview me at my children&apos;s old primary school for a film he was making about the coalition&apos;s education reforms. Coincidentally I had been interviewed in the same classroom a week before by one of the BBC&apos;s rather more aggressive beasts, working on a not dissimilar project. Their styles couldn&apos;t have been more different, but there is no doubt Mike got the best interview. He was courteous, fiercely well informed and quietly challenging. In spite of his calm, objective approach to the subjects he covered, we know from his Guardian column that the final product was usually hard-hitting in its conclusions. There are far too few people in the media who understand education and state schools in particular. So his death will be a terrible loss to his family, but also to the rest of us. Chris Keates, general secretary, NASUWT Mike&apos;s professionalism and his deep and extensive knowledge of education earned him enormous respect. He always provided an informed and accurate analysis and was unsurpassed in his ability to spot and expose any half-baked, ill-conceived and flawed education policy ministers might be attempting to foist on the public and the profession. He was an outstanding education journalist and a thoroughly nice person, who will be greatly missed. Fred Jarvis, former general secretary, National Union of Teachers Mike Baker was in the top flight of the many education editors and correspondents I have known or worked with over the past 50 years. He was not only a first-class communicator, fair in judgment and succinct in style, but also had a deep interest in education and a genuine and progressive concern for its development in the interests of all children and young people. It was when he came to write his column for Education Guardian, freed from the &quot;balance&quot; required in his reporting for the BBC, that one became fully aware of his strong sense of what mattered in advancing education and meeting the needs of the young and the country. He showed great courage in working on determinedly in spite of his illness and it is tragic that the cause of education will no longer benefit from his judgment and advocacy, and his friends will no longer enjoy his kindness, gentle humour and sheer niceness. Alice Woolley, editor, Education Guardian Mike&apos;s last column, in July, was on the subject of fair access to university. He said it was a scandal that money was being spent on bursaries and fee waivers  which he regarded as more or less a marketing ploy, since this money goes to students who had already made up their minds to study for a degree  instead of outreach programmes that could widen participation to poorer pupils. It was typical of Mike: an authoritative point of view, engagingly argued, based on proper research and expertise, and yet outspoken. We&apos;ll all miss Mike. His opinions simply mattered. David Willetts, universities minister Mike was a true education specialist  he was knowledgeable, independent, fair-minded and a master at conveying complicated details to a mass audience. Most of all, he never lost sight of how education can liberate individuals to realise their full potential. He approached his recent illness with the same inquiring spirit evident in his journalism, and he provided searingly honest accounts of his experiences in his award-winning blog. The whole education world will miss him terribly. David Lloyd, former chief schools press officer, DfE I knew Mike professionally for over 31 years.Our paths first crossed in parliament when he was working for PA. He had an open manner and a ready smile, a journalist and writer who had enormous integrity, a passion for education, pride in his daughters&apos; achievements and time for friends and the close-knit bunch that cover education. Latterly, he demonstrated the openness I first spotted 31 years ago when he wrote about his cancer. Olive Forsyth, former press officer, National Union of Teachers Mike was the first TV journalist I had to deal with when I became the NUT&apos;s press officer in 1990. Being the new kid on the block I needed help, and Mike was unstinting with his time in advising me on the ways of TV news-gathering. He was a gentle man and a gentleman. He was always patient and polite even when his deadlines were only minutes away. And he couldn&apos;t be spun a line by me, sad to say. He always managed at the Union&apos;s Easter conference to find the delegates with the views I least wanted aired, much to my chagrin. He was a private man who liked the company of his crew. Not for Mike the late-night carousing in the conference hotel. Instead he could be spotted on his early-morning run round Blackpool or Brighton or Harrogate, setting himself up for the trials of the day. I shall miss him.

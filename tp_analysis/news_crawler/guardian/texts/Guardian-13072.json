    "text": "&quot;We&apos;re using a thesaurus and finding different words to make &apos;sad&apos;,&quot; explains Rehan, eight. The Year 3 pupil reads from the list his English class has assembled. &quot;Grief-stricken, heartbroken, distressing.&quot; &quot;Heartbroken,&quot; interjects Christine Parker, the headteacher. &quot;I think that&apos;s how I felt in November 2011.&quot; That was when Gladstone Primary School in Peterborough was judged &quot;inadequate&quot; by Ofsted, the teaching inspectorate&apos;s lowest mark. The school was ordered to improve, and was inspected with alarming regularity until it did. After a stressful 16 months, Ofsted has finally issued a glowing report. &quot;Standards are rising rapidly. Pupils are making good progress often from a low starting point,&quot; judged inspectors. The behaviour of children at the school had always been good  in one report last year inspectors described pupils as &quot;delightful&quot;  but now the school was performing well academically. The head was praised for expecting high standards and for having &quot;significantly improved the school&quot;; the school was graded &quot;good&quot; in every aspect. A decent Ofsted is not, though, why the 450-pupil school has made the national news. Gladstone Primary is believed to be the only school in the country where none of its children speak English as their first language. This fact fascinates and repels media commentators. &quot;If you wonder what&apos;s gone wrong with Britain look no further than Gladstone Primary School, Peterborough, where not one pupil speaks English as a first language,&quot; thundered Peter Hill in The Express, without actually explaining why. Is Gladstone Primary a vision of a dystopian future or a triumph of multiculturalism? And what is it like to be a pupil and a teacher there? The colourful displays, the smell of crayons, and the hush of mid-morning lessons feels the same as any primary school in Britain, and the children huddled around tables wouldn&apos;t alarm the most bigoted of columnists: they speak perfect English and there are a number of white faces because of the recent arrival of Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish children from families drawn to agricultural jobs in the area. Peterborough has welcomed other nationalities ever since Seaxwulf  said to be an orphaned foreigner  established a seventh-century monastery in heathen East Anglia. The town that grew up on the edge of the Fens became a major centre for Italian immigrants in the 1950s, who laboured in the brickworks and later, Pakistani and Bangladeshi workers. There are more than 100 languages spoken and more than a third of children in Peterborough speak English as their second language, up from one in five in 2008. Across Britain, schools are becoming more multicultural. Just over one million primary and secondary pupils spoke a first language other than English in 2012 compared with around 800,000 in 2007. On average, one in six (17.5%) primary school pupils in 2012 spoke another language at home, up from 16.8% in 2011. The challenges facing Gladstone primary, though, seem particularly acute. About 80% of its pupils are from a Pakistani background: most speak Punjabi but the school&apos;s 20 other languages include Dari, Pashto, Gujarati, Kurdish, Arabic, Lithuanian, Latvian, Russian, Polish, Slovakian, Czech, German and French. One child is from the Seychelles; another from Guinea Bissau. At break, six Year 5 girls all cheerily admit they couldn&apos;t speak English when they arrived at school. Where does a school begin when faced with so many foreign languages? &quot;Bilingualism isn&apos;t a learning difficulty. A positive view of the bilingual child is the key,&quot; says Parker firmly. She was born in Orpington, Kent and, her view of teaching was transformed in 1986 when she began teaching at a school in Sheffield where a third of pupils were of Pakistani descent. Inspired, she worked in Pakistan in the late 80s, picked up Urdu, and has taught in diverse schools ever since. Some teachers (or people in general) can be put off finding out about another community, frightened of asking questions that cause offence, but Parker found that getting to know Urdu-speakers gave her the confidence to explore other communities. &quot;I remember in 1986 being very inquisitive in asking the children about their lives,&quot; she says. To help Gladstone&apos;s staff with their learning, a teacher gives a short presentation about one of their pupils&apos; countries at the weekly staff briefing: last week it was Latvia; next week is Lithuania.

With pupils aged four and five, the teachers give a running commentary on work and group play. &quot;Being a talkative adult helps. I&apos;ve got a lot of talkative adults in the early years,&quot; laughs Parker. The emphasis is matching actions and objects with words, not on asking intimidating questions. In later years, Chris Wells, a young teacher in charge of a Year 6 class, explains he always runs through the words and vocabulary of a topic before they begin. When the class studied chocolate, for instance, there were a lot of new words to learn. In this environment, he says, pupils become completely unafraid to ask questions that may reveal when they don&apos;t know something. &quot;Diet!&quot; shouts Wells to his class of 30. &quot;It can be used as a verb, to diet, but in this case it is a noun  Diet Coke.&quot; &quot;Is it a proper noun?&quot; pipes up a boy at the front. This lesson is already going over my head. Not speaking English as a first language could amplify differences of ability within classrooms but in the Year 3 lesson with the thesaurus, pupils are engaged in vastly different tasks, according to their linguistic attainment. While some are learning sophisticated words such as &quot;distressing&quot; those who are currently less proficient in English are sorting words according to their place in the alphabet. Gladstone has 18 teaching assistants  one for each class  and 10 of these are bilingual, which can be crucial in the classroom. Wells hails from nearby Grantham. Does he ever feel disadvantaged if pupils speak their own (secret) language that he cannot understand? &quot;I can feel a little outnumbered but it&apos;s never been a big issue for me,&quot; he says. His teaching assistant speaks seven languages, and quickly notices if pupils are behaving badly. Teaching assistant Daleep Wahiwala has worked at Gladstone for 30 years. Even when she started, the majority of the pupils were Muslim. Her three sons went here, and they are now an accountant, surveyor and optician  proof the school works well, she says. But Wahiwala has also served as a school governor, and says that some years ago the other governors became increasingly concerned that their children had so few opportunities to speak, and learn, English. &quot;It was getting to a situation where our children didn&apos;t need to speak English when they were going out. They&apos;d go to the local shops, which were Asian, and the doctors were Asian. We talked about what needed to be done, and Christine has actually done it,&quot; she says. Those who fear that parts of Britain are becoming ghettos wonder whether the children of non-British parents are sufficiently encouraged to learn English. When I ask if Parker has ever encountered a child who doesn&apos;t want to learn the language, Parker looks at me as if I am talking gobbledegook. &quot;No,&quot; she says, amazed that anyone would consider this to be a possibility. And does Gladstone ever forbid foreign languages be spoken at school? &quot;Why would you do that?&quot; she asks, mystified. Actually, though, she remembers there was one time when she told their cricket team not to speak in Punjabi when playing an opposing school. But surely it could be a competitive advantage? &quot;Of course, we do want to win!&quot; laughs Parker. The school is helped by additional local-authority funding for newly arrived pupils in their first three years at school. Around 97,000 this year has funded innovations such as a new &quot;family support worker&quot; who liaises with parents (who may struggle with English) and visits families at home if pupils are absent from school. Other unique features include a buddy system, so new arrivals are paired up with schoolmates who speak their &quot;specialist&quot; language, and Gladstone&apos;s determination to forge links with other schools. Sixth-formers from The King&apos;s School in Peterborough visit to teach science; others from Oundle public school also take English classes. &quot;Although I have socialist leanings, if somebody offers me something that benefits the children, I&apos;ll take it,&quot; jokes Parker. Then there is a regular arrangement with a school in Stamford in which Year 5 pupils spend time at each other&apos;s schools every fortnight. &quot;What I&apos;m really pleased about is that they are really learning together,&quot; adds Parker. &quot;It&apos;s really good to have peers speak English as a first language.&quot;     In the playground at Gladstone Primary, where none of the pupils speak English as their first language. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian    If Gladstone has problems, they seem fairly typical of any school. When I arrive, a mother has turned up to discuss her daughter being bullied. (When I ask about racist bullying, Parker says the school addresses any incidents in the same way: &quot;We are very open with children and we believe in restorative justice,&quot; she says.) The repeated Ofsted scrutiny was enormously stressful. &quot;There is no doubt it has a negative impact on staff health and wellbeing, and it wouldn&apos;t be fair to gloss over that,&quot; admits Parker. However, a morning at the school is a genuinely uplifting experience. &quot;I find it much more rewarding,&quot; says Wells of teaching at Gladstone compared with his experiences at other schools. &quot;There&apos;s that wonderful spark you see when children understand. With these children, it&apos;s much, much bigger and you see the sense of pride when they&apos;ve got it. It sounds horribly cliched but teaching here is the best thing I&apos;ve ever done.&quot; Teachers know when to be diplomatic but the beauty of children is they cannot be media trained. What&apos;s the best thing about the school? &quot;We&apos;re famous!&quot; cries Sarah, eight. &quot;We&apos;ve been on TV. We&apos;ve been on the newspapers. We&apos;ve been everywhere.&quot; Areesha, also eight, says Gladstone is &quot;better than any other school. It&apos;s better than the whole wide world.&quot; Zohib and Maadina are 10 and more circumspect but still extremely positive. &quot;The learning is good because if you don&apos;t understand something and don&apos;t want to tell the whole class, you can have a one-on-one with the teacher,&quot; says Zohib. &quot;Everyone is a friend,&quot; adds Maadina. &quot;If someone is upset, someone else goes and cheers them up.&quot; Peter, 11, came to Britain from Slovakia when he was eight, and only arrived at Gladstone last year. His previous school contained more English pupils. &quot;It was a bit difficult because some English people speak fast and use different words so I didn&apos;t understand it,&quot; he says. For all this positivity, it is not only rightwingers who sometimes wonder if it would be better if schools like Gladstone contained pupils who speak English as their first language as well. It would save the need for trips to other schools for one thing. &quot;This is representative of the community that is here,&quot; says Parker  and all of the few English-as-a-first-language pupils at the school during her tenure left at 11; none were prematurely removed by concerned or prejudiced parents. She doesn&apos;t see Gladstone as a ghetto. &quot;We&apos;ve got more diversity and we&apos;re very celebratory about that diversity,&quot; she says of the school&apos;s changing cultural mix. &quot;It&apos;s my job to ensure that when the children leave they are well-balanced, achieving what is expected of them and having a perspective of Peterborough that is not just of one area.&quot; She argues that other predominantly white British schools (and there are plenty in the region) should forge links with multicultural schools. &quot;They have as much of a responsibility to ensure that the children in their schools understand the diversity of Peterborough and have some real experience of that.&quot; Parker is running a school, not a crusade, but I can see how Gladstone Primary might educate adults as well as children. As Parker puts it, &quot;Not only is most of the world bilingual, a lot of the world is multilingual. We&apos;re the odd ones out. When I was working in Pakistan, many of our friends spoke five, six, seven languages. We tend to have a fear about language but different languages bring different ways of seeing the world.&quot;",

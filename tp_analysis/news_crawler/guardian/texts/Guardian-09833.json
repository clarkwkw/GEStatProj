    "text": "So, are the &quot;No dash for gas&quot; protesters perched atop the cooling towers of the new West Burton gas-fired power station in Nottinghamshire right? They argue:  The new &apos;dash for gas&apos; will leave us dependent on a highly polluting and increasingly expensive fossil fuel for decades to come. It would make even our modest carbon reduction targets impossible to hit, and cause household energy bills to soar even further.  The answer is mostly yes, for reasons I&apos;ll explain below. So why is the new dash for gas now sprinting out of the starting blocks? For two reasons, one justified and one not. The first is that some new gas will be needed in the UK, as ageing and dirty nuclear and coal power plants are phased out. The second is that the chancellor George Osborne has been captured by a small but influential group of fracking fanatics who have convinced him that shale gas will bring a game-changing bonanza of cheap gas. It won&apos;t. But let&apos;s start with the basics and the most independent source we have, the government&apos;s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. They are charged with setting out the lowest cost, lowest risk path to meeting the nation&apos;s legally binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Their &quot;Plan A&quot; allows for 10GW of new gas-fired electricity generation, about 10 new power stations. For the energy policy geeks out there, that leads to a carbon intensity of about 50g of CO2 being emitted per kWh of electricity in 2030. But, if the renewable energy or nuclear power envisaged in Plan A does not materialise in a big way, then says the UK will need a Plan B: 20GW of new gas power and about 100g of CO2 per kWh in 2030. That doesn&apos;t mean the nation will have given up on its carbon targets, says the CCC, but the balance of cost and risk is better for Plan A. The 20GW goal is what ministers are now pursuing, so according the CCC they have chosen a more risky and more expensive path.  How so? First, no-one outside the shale gas lobby thinks fracking will deliver cheap, plentiful gas for the UK and so make a big dash for gas sensible. &quot;Look at European gas price projections ... they all agree on the direction  up. European shale will help, but not on a US scale.&quot; says the CBI&apos;s boss John Cridland. He later added: &quot;An over reliance on new gas would leave us exposed to global price and supply fluctuations and jeopardise our carbon targets.&quot;  It&apos;s worth contrasting that with Osborne&apos;s comment, when he shoehorned himself into the dash for gas announcement made by energy secretary Ed Davey in March. &quot;Gas is a reliable, affordable source of energy,&quot; said the chancellor. Very few agree with him, not least people facing soaring gas and electricity bills, mainly due to rising gas prices over the last few years. Another risk comes from the duty to meet carbon targets. The 20 big new power stations will apparently have licences to operate to 2045 without cutting their carbon emissions. I can&apos;t see how that tallies with cutting emissions by the amount needed, but let&apos;s say it somehow can be made to do so. That means we&apos;ll need carbon capture and storage technology operating at full scale, yet that seems as far off as ever thereby creating another risk. A final risk was set out recently by a report commissioned by consultants E3G, which found that a gas-heavy electricity system in the UK created a much greater risk of soaring energy prices than a renewables-based system. So, what one might call a &quot;stroll for gas&quot; is needed - roughly 10 new plants - and even a dash for gas does not necessarily blow the UK&apos;s carbon budgets, according to the CCC. But the dash increases the risk of both higher price rises than already predicted and the risk of busting those budgets. Unless you don&apos;t believe climate change is a threat, or you do believe in the UK shale gas fantasy, the dash for gas looks dumb. Osborne appears to be winning the energy policy battle, which is expected to come to a head next week with the publication of the energy bill. He &quot;has different facts&quot;, according to a senior source, taking advice from only a very small circle. If he really cares about the economy, he should get out more.",

The kitchen is typically a place of warmth and good memories, but what I&apos;ve recently learned about kitchens in many countries around the world has moved me to take action.     Julia Roberts, 2011 Photograph: Rex Features    As the world unites to celebrate International Women&apos;s Day this week, I am thinking of the woman who risks her life through the simple act of cooking. In fact, preparing a meal for herself and her family can be one of the most dangerous activities that a woman does. Alarmingly, nearly 3 billion people still rely on solid fuels to cook their food each day. When burned in open fires and inefficient cookstoves, fuels such as wood, coal, charcoal and animal waste create a toxic smoke that fills homes and communities the world over. Two million people die annually from pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and heart disease caused by cookstove smoke, and millions more suffer from these ailments for years, as well as from injuries such as cataracts and burns. Women are predominantly the household cooks in most countries, and with their children swaddled to their backs or at their side as they cook, the entire family becomes victim to this silent killer. Before they can even begin cooking, however, women will likely have spent hours searching for wood and other fuel sources. Children often accompany their mother on this journey, which keeps them from attending school or earning an income. Such a nurturing act as cooking should not put lives at risk. There are effective solutions, which can save lives, improve livelihoods, empower women and combat climate change. That is precisely why the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves was created. Launched by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and hosted by the United Nations Foundation, the alliance and its hundreds of partners across the world believe that cooking shouldn&apos;t kill. It is under this remit that the alliance hopes to shape a robust market for clean cookstoves and fuels  a market that begins and ends with the needs of women. Their involvement can include providing input on stove design, owning a cookstove business, and training other women on new stove and fuel technologies. Clean cookstoves can have a transformative impact on women, as well as on their families, their communities and their environment. The numerous benefits include better health, increased safety, reduced poverty, cleaner air, and a more sustainable environment. That&apos;s why I am helping the alliance promote the adoption of 100 million clean cookstoves by 2020, inspired by the possibilities that lie ahead for women and their families once the smoke clears.  Julia Roberts serves as the global ambassador of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.",

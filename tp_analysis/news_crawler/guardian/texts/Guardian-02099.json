    "headline": "Windows 8 is 'generational change' says Sinofsky, launching downloadable beta", 
    "text": "Microsoft has released Windows 8 in trial form to the public, describing the first truly mobile version of its best selling software as a &quot;generational change&quot; in its approach to computing. The software is available to download now, before its commercial release in a few months time, and marks Microsoft&apos;s make-or-break bid to compete with Apple and Google in controlling the next generation of computers. Already downloaded by three million developers, the beta version of Windows 8 can from today be populated by dozens of applications. These will remain free until the commercial launch, and include redesigned versions of Amazon&apos;s Kindle e-book reader, games such as Cut the Rope, and the Vimeo video sharing site. Based on the well-regarded Metro interface which Microsoft developed for smartphones, Windows 8 is a recognition that the future of computing is mobile, and it is designed to work on touchscreens or with a keyboard and mouse, on gadgets ranging tablets and instant-on notebooks to more traditional laptops and PCs. In a break with the past  and a sign of where Microsoft thinks the market is moving  Windows boss Steven Sinofsky chose to show off his new baby not at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, but at the annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. &quot;Windows 8 is a generational change in the Windows operating system,&quot; said Sinofsky, describing the release as Microsoft&apos;s most radical redesign since Windows 95, the version which launched Windows into worldwide fame. &quot;We challenged ourselves to bring the best of mobility and the best of PCs, in an experience where you don&apos;t have to compromise.&quot; The redesign began three years ago, straight after the launch of Windows 7, and before the arrival of the first iPad, with Microsoft&apos;s developers making dummy versions of tablet computers out of cardboard to imagine what the real thing would feel like. &quot;As exciting as all these devices are today, we all face a little bit of a yearning,&quot; said Sinofsky. &quot;We too often have to chose between consumption and productivity, more battery life or functionality, a tablet or a laptop, a touch interface or keyboard and mouse. You want to have these capabilities no matter where you are or where you are working. The operating system should just scale with you.&quot; Windows 8 will use the cloud to store users&apos; preferences in the way they set up their computers  from home screen photos to the collection of apps or favourite websites. By signing in to any new Windows 8 device with a Microsoft ID, a user&apos;s personalised desktop will be summoned up instantly rather than needing to be recreated. In touchscreen mode, the Windows 8 screen can be unlocked by gestures. For example by touching each face in a family photo in a particular order. On a PC, where a mouse and keyboard are in use, the password remains typed. Once unlocked, the user is taken to a series of screens on which can sit dozens of live tiles, as Microsoft calls its app icons. As on its phones, these are animated by their content  the Twitter tile shows the latest posting to a feed, the Facebook tile the most recent photos uploaded by friends. Familiar smartphone gestures such as pinch to zoom out, tap to enlarge and swiping are all featured. The way a mouse is used has been updated  click on any of the four corners of the screen to summon up different menus, such as the apps list. More than one app can run at once, but only two can share the screen. Once opened, windows automatically size to fit, rather than overlapping each other. They appear to have three preset formats  quarter-, half- or three-quarter screen. Windows 8 may eventually make its way onto the living room screen. It is the first version of Windows adapted for the low power chips made by British company ARM Holdings that are present in 99% of all smartphones, tablets and even smart TVs. The new software has big boots to fill. Windows 7 sold 525m licenses, more than any of its predecessors. But its popularity was on the PC, and sales of PCs are being overtaken by more mobile devices.",

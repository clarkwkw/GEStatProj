Photographer GMB Akash explains: 'This century-old building in the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh does not harbour ghosts of the past  it shelters living and hopeful souls, braving life in the present. It is home to 80 families of sweepers - one of the most neglected and downtrodden communities, despite rendering an important service making it deserved to be noticed and respected' Photograph: GMB Akash       Farmer under the Sun, 2012. 'Taken in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, a farmer dries rice in the hot sun. Sunlight helps the drying of agricultural products. When the harvest season comes, the farmers are ready to collect crops from the rice paddies in order to ease milling and production' Photograph: Alamsyah Rauf       Uyuni, 2011. 'It is one of the most impressive sights in the world, bringing time to a standstill. The Salar de Uyuni in south-western Bolivia, is now one of the biggest mountain ranges in the world at an elevation of 3,656 metres (11,995 ft) above mean sea level. Salar de Uyuni is one of the most coveted sources in the world thanks to new technologies.

This panorama was captured at the Quiver Tree Forest Restcamp, and covers a 230-degree view, composed of 12 exposures' Photograph: Florian Breuer       Model Housing, 2012. 'Designer housing lies almost empty unsold after the housing boom ends in Spain; just some of the estimated 1.2m empty properties that Spain has on offer. This estate near the coast is eerily quiet with only a few properties occupied; concept living that has made it to construction but with no one to move in. We seem to have an innate need to order and compartmentalise our lives, often more obvious from the air' Photograph: Steve Brockett       Hong Kong Hole, 2010. 'In east Asia, western style development is racing ahead of other projects' Photograph: Stuart Chape       Swan on Nest of Rubbish, SE2, 2010.

'A child walking on the streets of the Gher District. In Ulaan Baator, a huge number of children are not able to attend the school because of the extremely poor conditions of their families. 2008 became the point of no return - for the first time in history there are more people living in cities than in rural areas. Cities will grow even larger due to climate change and to environmental migrants, who are destined to become the new humanitarian emergency of the planet in the next few decades' Photograph: Alessandro Grassani       Environmental migrants: the last illusion, Ulaan Baator, Mongolia #06, 2011 'Erdene Tuya lies in bed with her three-year-old son called Tuvchinjin and a lamb which sleeps with them.

'Trading with electronic waste has become a lucrative business in which millions are earned while professional recycling is quite expensive' Photograph: Kai Leffelbein/Laif       Polluted Landscape, 2012. 'Due to the vast exploitation of coal mines, meadows in Holingol City, Inner Mongolia, China, are left degraded and no cattle or sheep exist there. In order to maintain the image of the city, the local government sculptured more than 120 sheep, as well as cattle, horses and camels in the Horqin grassland' Photograph: Lu Guang       Residents going back home to take their belongings, Tomioka, Fukushima No-Go Zone, Japan, 2011 'At the time of the Fukushima evacuation, the inhabitants fled from the radioactive cloud leaving everything behind. 134,000 people were forced to evacuate. Once a month, residents of the evacuated towns have special permission from the authorities to return to their homes to check that everything is in place and to remove their personal belongings. A recent survey among the evacuees has determined that 80% of the evacuees were absolutely not aware of what was going on and had no information on the type of protection to be taken' Photograph: Pierpaolo Mittica       GPAction, 2011 '180km off the Greenland coast, 18 international activists from five inflatable speedboats, launched from the Greenpeace ship, Esperanza, climb ladders onto the 53,000 tonne oil exploratory rig, Leiv Eiriksson. Greenpeace was attempting to stop the Leiv Eiriksson oil rig from drilling in Baffin Bay - one of the most pristine and fragile natural areas in the world, home to  important and vulnerable wildlife including almost all of the worlds Narwhal population as well as blue whales, sea bird colonies, and polar bears' Photograph: Steve Morgan       Trashfighter, 2009 'During my research travel through western Africa on the topic of waste and recycling, I focused on children at dump sites. Through my series Trashfighters, I wanted to show the living realities of these people, fighting on the waste for their everyday survival' Photograph: Igor F. Petkovic       Nuclear Winter, 2012 'This picture was taken on a very cold winter day on the shore of Lake Bokod near Oroszlny. This lake is known for the little fisherman houses and the warm temperature of the lake's water. The Oroszlny power plant is situated in front of the houses and the lake is never frozen in wintertime. When I took this photo, smoke erupted from the power plant and then it just started to snow' Photograph: Zoltn Balogh       An Oil Truck Heading Through Rwanda Bound for Uganda, 2011.

    "text": "The coffee chain Starbucks is introducing a reusable cup which UK customers can keep, in a move designed to encourage them to be more environmentally conscious while saving money. The reusable cup is based on the design of the brand&apos;s distinctive white and green paper cups and will cost 1. Customers who use their reusable cup will receive a 25p discount off their Starbucks drink every time they use it. The cup is made of a high-quality material which is lighter than the Starbucks ceramic tumblers, which will still be available. The reusable cups will be available in selected stores nationwide from today but will be rolled out gradually elsewhere.  Reusable. Recyclable. Re-enjoyable. Coming soon to your local store. twitter.com/StarbucksUK/st  Starbucks UK (@StarbucksUK) April 19, 2013  The US coffee giant has pledged to press ahead with a major expansion plan in the UK  aiming to open 300 new stores and create 5,000 extra jobs by 2016  amid ongoing controversy over its failure to pay UK corporation tax over the past three years. Ian Cranna, vice-president of UK marketing for Starbucks, said: &quot;We know that our customers really care about saving money and doing their bit for the environment; between 2008 and 2012 the number of people using a Starbucks reusable tumbler increased by 235% and our new reusable cup is a low-cost, high-impact way to help make a difference on reducing waste.&quot; Globally the chain is aiming for 5% of drinks made in its stores to be served in reusable cups by 2015 and the company says its move in the UK is a key step towards reaching this goal.",

    "text": "Like it or not, life is filled with uncertainty. So how can you make the best possible decisions based on incomplete knowledge? One practical way is to invest some time into learning about probability, and a great way to get started is by reading John Haigh&apos;s accessible new book, Probability: A Very Short Introduction [Oxford University Press; 2012: Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK/kindle; Amazon US/kindle].    In this engrossing book, mathematician John Haigh deftly explains how random chance works and provides a basic framework for understanding probability. Throughout the book, he presents the philosophical approaches and historical development of probability theory and discusses its many applications from economics and epidemiology to gambling and weather forecasting. Although this is not a maths book, a few simple mathematical equations and graphs appear at times to help explain some of the basic concepts and real-life paradoxes that trip people up. And many of these thought experiments are fun, too. Overall, the author focuses on teaching the rational thinking patterns that underlie plain old common sense so one can make the best decisions possible.  Like the other titles in the series, this book is small and light enough to fit into a bag or a large pocket and is easily held in one hand for ease of reading whilst straphanging on the subway. Even though this paperback is only 128 pages long, it covers a surprising variety of topics with enough depth and detail that you actually learn to think a little more clearly. This book would make a great supplemental reading for maths, statistics and epidemiology classes.  There are more than 200 titles in Oxford University Press&apos;s Very Short Introduction series, covering a diversity of topics from global warming to advertising. These books have been translated into 25 languages and have sold more than 3.5 million copies since the series was initiated in 1995. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  John Haigh is Emeritus Reader of Mathematics and an Associate Tutor of Mathematics at the University of Sussex. His research interests focus on the field of probability, with applications ranging from biology to various (theoretical) aspects of gambling. He has published more than 50 academic papers on probability and three popular books. He also is a fan of sports, and has been known to occasionally bet on horse races. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientistevil google+: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

    "text": "Getting your work out of the studio and on to gallery walls is a challenge for every art student. Unless you&apos;re constructing scale replicas of historic landmarks out of snot, used lollipop sticks and furballs, it&apos;s unlikely to make a splash on the front pages of the newspapers. So young artists have started grouping together to get themselves noticed. And they&apos;re not wasting any time. The role of the graduate art collective is now being played by the student one.     Drawing from The Fluent Collective    &quot;There&apos;s a feeling that the world&apos;s moving too fast  in all practices, not just art,&quot; says Roman Sheppard Dawson, 20, a first-year art student at Central St Martin&apos;s, who co-founded The Fluent Collective in September with two friends. &quot;The idea is that if we can refine the collective now, then when we&apos;re graduates we&apos;ll have a better framework to build on.&quot; Dawson hopes that the collective will help its members gain more exposure  the trio have already exhibited work under the group banner and plan to curate their own shows  but also aid their creative development. &quot;Sometimes you get so much inside your own head with a piece of work that you can&apos;t step back from it,&quot; says Dawson. &quot;With a collective, you can talk to people. You don&apos;t get so lost in the art world, which sometimes feels like you&apos;re swimming in a sea of oil.&quot; In today&apos;s world, the tradition of artistic collaboration has expanded to embrace countless digital forms. &quot;The way students  and graduates in particular  now network has radically changed due to the internet, and understanding that point is crucial,&quot; says Hannah Barton, an artist and staff member at Space Studios, one of the largest arts organisations in the UK, which itself originally started life as a collective.     Monika Grabowska's work for the photography collective Softbox    &quot;Social media, websites and smartphones have widened access and informed practice alike; collectives no longer have to be groups of people who meet up in person  they can be a Facebook group, exist on a forum, or communicate via Skype. Those wanting to be involved in a peer group will always find a way  digital innovations simply make the choice of how to do this broader.&quot; For James Hopkirk, editor at Ideas Tap, a creative network and arts funding charity that helps support upcoming talent, university will always provide a &quot;critical opportunity&quot; for students to build up professional relationships. &quot;It is tough out there for young artists,&quot; says Hopkirk. &quot;The lack of funding and jobs is brutal, and you need all the help you can get. The more you can work with other people and be entrepreneurial the better.&quot; Hopkirk adds: &quot;Some people can be anxious about sending messages out to people and saying you like their work and want to work with them. It&apos;s a bit taboo, like online dating. If you find people whose work excites you, then you should dive in head first.&quot;     Work from the Salt Fox  collective    For SaltFox Collective, a group of contemporary craft students studying at Falmouth University, receiving Ideas Tap funding towards an exhibition is just one of the achievements they can boast of. As well as using the collective to support their varied work as individuals, they are planning to set up a business together. They have recently completed their first full day running school workshops. &quot;It&apos;s really good to get a strong foundation early,&quot; says SaltFox member Lizzie Simpson, 23. &quot;We can slowly build up contacts to work with and do workshops for. And if you have nine people, that&apos;s nine different sets of connections, rather than just one.&quot; At Edinburgh College of Art, a group of students have formed a photography collective called SoftBox. They have already staged exhibitions and hosted networking events, and hope that by pooling their skills and giving members experience that goes beyond their creative degrees, they will be benefit as they advance into the professional world. Softbox, which is currently crowd funding for a large exhibition, believes it has never been more important for art students to form collectives.     Hannah Killoh's photograph for Softbox    &quot;Finding your place within the art world takes determination, experience and a lot of support,&quot; says Hannah Killoh, 21. &quot;Forming a collective gives you all of those things, while creating a sense of identity and purpose. Through our identity as SoftBox, we have achieved a successful online presence to help us in creating new opportunities. &quot;It&apos;s easier to raise our profile with the skills and social networks of 11 artists coming together, rather than each of us trying to make it alone. Forming a collective can only further your experience and better prepare you for what lies beyond graduation. &quot;For SoftBox the question is not why collaborate, but why not?&quot;",

    "text": "Clear vs. Wunderlist  Wunderlist, free. Available for iTunes and Android Clear, 1.49. Available for iTunes Both are simple list makers, but Wunderlist doubles as a task manager. Clear, with its ice-cold swipe and swoosh functions, feels like an app the iPhone was made for. Don&apos;t expect it to do more than make lists though  it doesn&apos;t. Wunderlist, however, lets you give individual list items due dates and reminders, and it will sync with your desktop. A good way to use it is to give each module you&apos;re studying its own list and then add tasks or reminders to it. Evernote vs. Simplenote Evernote, free. Available on iTunes  Simplenote, free. Available on iTunes You&apos;ll do a lot of note-taking at university so it&apos;s worth getting your hands on either of these. Evernote is one of the most popular and powerful note makers. Entries can be made as text, audio or photos, filed in a particular notebook, and synced with other devices. Simplenote is, as its name suggests, a simple note maker. You can write notes, file them and share them. That&apos;s it. If you&apos;re looking for a digital jotter, pick this. If you want a solid, capable and modern project book, pick Evernote. Pin Drop vs. Foursquare  Foursquare, free. Available for iTunes and Android  Pin Drop, free. Available for iTunes and Android Discover your new university city with Pin Drop. Pin new haunts to your map, add photos and tags, and share them on Twitter. Foursquare is Pin Drop&apos;s more sociable  and more fun  older brother. Checking in to places earns you points and badges, which are surprisingly rewarding. It also pits you against your mates by tracking where they&apos;re at. Making your whereabouts public can be annoying though  you might find that people bump into you. MoneyBook vs Pocket Expense  MoneyBook, 1.99. Available on iTunes Pocket Expense, 2.99. Available on iTunes If you find money stressful, MoneyBook can help. Its simple design and powerful functionality make keeping track of what you&apos;ve spent easy. Other money apps, like Pocket Expense, are a bit nerdy and have too many functions. They&apos;re probably more suited to your parents. With MoneyBook you can categorise your spending and get monthly breakdowns. There&apos;s only problem: remembering how much those shots of tequila cost may be as hard as remembering how many you had. Pocket vs. Zootool  Pocket, free. Available on iTunes and Android  Zootool, 1.49. Available on iTunes Pocket, a super-savvy saving tool, used to be called Read It Later. In its new form, it&apos;s is both neater and cooler. Zootool is very similar but with more sociable functions. You can create a profile, view what others have put into captivity, share your finds and follow fellow keepers. Both are great if you&apos;re researching or if you want to keep what you&apos;ve found in one easily accessible space. Likewise, both are available in-browser too and allow you to save your finds with just one click. The differences: Zootool is best suited to images and Pocket does a great job of stripping a page down to only text, making reading easier.

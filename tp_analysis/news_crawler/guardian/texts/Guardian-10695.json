    "text": "    Rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol Re and atomic number 75. This element is one of the rarest on Earth, so its existence was predicted by Mendeleev based on his periodic table long before it was discovered by three chemists in Germany in 1925. Its name is Latin for the river Rhine. Rhenium is a dense silvery-white transition metal. It has one of the highest melting points of any element (only tungsten and carbon have higher melting points) and it is one of the densest of all elements (only osmium, iridium and platinum are denser).  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this element is where it is found. Although vanishingly rare on Earth, this element was discovered in 1994 to occur as a pure rhenium sulfide mineral in just one small place: Russia&apos;s Kudriavy volcano (doi:10.1038/369051a0). This volcano is located on Iturup island in the Kuril archipelago near the northeastern coast of Japan. Every day, several grams of pure whitish-grey rhenium sulfide are ejected from one fumarole. But what makes this volcano -- and, more specifically, just one of this volcano&apos;s fumaroles -- so special? No one knows, although it probably comes from a significant rhenium deposit located in subducted sediments far below (ref).  Rhenium has no known biological role, nor is it poisonous, so it&apos;s not particularly interesting to biologists. That said, two of its radioactive isotopes with short half-lives, rhenium-186 (half-life: 89 hours) and rhenium-188 (half-life: 17 hours), are sometimes used to treat liver cancer.  Here&apos;s our favourite chemistry professor telling us a little more about the wonders of rhenium, particularly its use in aircraft engines. In this video, the professor also shows us his own personal crystal of pure rhenium, which was a gift:             [video link] .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

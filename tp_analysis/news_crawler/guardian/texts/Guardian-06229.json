    "text": "David Kushner&apos;s biography on id Software quotes John Carmack positing the idea that stories in video games are like stories in porn films  they&apos;re expected to be there, but they&apos;re not that important. If ever there was a video game that stands in resolute opposition to Carmack&apos;s opinion in this regard, it&apos;s Spec Ops: The Line. Yager&apos;s new third-person shooter is all about story. In fact, story is its principle asset. Whether it becomes a success or failure depends entirely on the willingness of players to engage with its story to the extent that they look past its erratic mechanics and unsatisfying gameplay. The game opens with a rather stunning set-piece involving a helicopter chase through the rooftops of Dubai. The player controls a soldier firing a chaingun from the door of a chopper as enemy copters swarm and buzz the vehicle. As the chase unfolds, the player inevitable tears through buildings and rips up rooftops with high-calibre rounds as they try to fend off their attackers. The contemporary trappings of the soldiers and the high-octane feel of the scene immediately recall the CoD: Modern Warfare games, but a closer inspections reveals something else; the back and forth between the player&apos;s character and his AI pilot ally sounds strained and cracked  a million miles away from the professional zeal of CoD&apos;s soldiers. The chase ends in a crash, and then the plot flashes back to a few weeks earlier. Dubai, it turns out, is in ruins after a cataclysmic sandstorm demolished a lot of the city, and cut it off from the outside world. After an appeal was sent out, a US army regiment called the 33rd diverted their progression home from Afghanistan and headed into the buried city. That was some time ago and it turns out that that US high command hasn&apos;t heard from the 33rd, or its commander, Colonel Konrad, in quite some time. To that end, it dispatches a three-man Delta Squad to Dubai to find out the reason Konrad isn&apos;t answering their attempts to contact him. The team consists of Adams, a heavy gunner; Lugo, a mouthy sniper; and their commanding officer, Captain Walker, a man who served under Konrad in Afghanistan and considers him both a hero and a patriot. The game&apos;s opening salvo unfolds in mere minutes and this set-up is typical of the drum-tight pacing of the game&apos;s plot. There&apos;s hardly an ounce of fat on the story and, even though Spec Ops: The Line has a couple of glaring issues in how it plays, the player never feels like they&apos;re being shunted from one room to another in order to activate another drab cutscene. Unlike other shooters featuring the modern military, the game&apos;s story takes few cues from contemporary action cinema, the odd epic gun battle notwithstanding. Instead, Yager is aiming for grittier territory in Spec Ops: The Line, which forgoes the usual machismo of a game of this type for something far darker; Apocalypse Now  and, by extension, Joseph Conrad&apos;s Heart Of Darkness  looms large over the proceedings. As Walker and his men head into Dubai, they soon become aware that something very disturbing has taken place in the wake of Konrad&apos;s arrival in the city. They come across refugees who fire at anyone wearing a US army uniform, dead bodies strung up from lamp-posts and overpasses and walls covered in the pictures of lost loved ones. These signs of order breaking down in the city soon give way to scenes of abject trauma, testing the resolve of Walker and his men, whose core relationship soon begins to crack under the strain of what they&apos;re seeing around them. The sense that madness has been allowed to run riot is compounded by the fact that all of this horror is surrounded by the remnants of a bastion to luxury and affluence. The game&apos;s Dubai may lie in ruins, but what of it that remains in tact sits garishly next to the grisly scenes it houses. One minute, Walker and his men are wading through a mass grave, knee deep in charred corpses. The next, they&apos;re standing in the lobby of a hotel staring up at two giant gold giraffes that flank a marble staircase in front of them, as fish swim in an aquarium in the floor beneath their feet. This bizarre clash of opulence and gore lends the city an otherworldly atmosphere and feeds into the unhinged mood of the story.     Spec Ops The Line    Unfortunately, the gameplay augmenting all the action in the story is nowhere near as well realised. The controls are fairly straightforward: LT and RT are aim and shoot respectively, Y switches weapons, A snaps the player to cover, X is reload, B is a melee attack or it vaults the player over nearby walls and LB activates thrown projectiles. The right bumper allows players to target enemies with their squad members and the D-Pad switches between projectiles and, in a nice touch, makes Walker place a silencer on certain weapons for stealth kills. At its core, Spec Ops: The Line is a cover-based shooter in the mould of Gears Of War, although comparing its gameplay to Epic&apos;s testosterone-juiced fragfest is doing the latter something of a disservice. Gears Of War may contain lunk-headed stories, but their cover-based mechanics are absolutely reliable. Sadly the same can&apos;t be said for Spec Ops: The Line. Hitting A slides Walker into cover, and moving the thumbstick changes his position while he hugs the wall, but the slightest movement away from cover and Walker stands bolt upright. In the middle of a firefight, this can be slightly problematic. Furthermore, certain pieces of cover have an annoying habit of jutting out into the player&apos;s firing line, while not obscuring their crosshairs. This leads to instance where the player will think that they&apos;ve drawn a bead on an enemy, but when they pull the trigger, they empty half a clip of ammo into a piece of scenery inches away from Walker&apos;s face. If they have an RPG to hand in this situation, they&apos;re toast. Mapping the melee attack to the same button used for a wall-vaulting action was also a bad idea, due to the fact that Walker can only vault over certain pieces of cover, and only then at certain points. If the player is pinned down and needs to move to another piece of cover, unless they hit the A button exactly the right point, they run the risk of Walker attacking it with the butt of his gun, while enemies pepper them with bullets. The first time this happens, it&apos;s admittedly rather funny. By the 15th or 16th instance, it&apos;s enough to prompt language that&apos;s unprintable here. All of these shonky mechanics wouldn&apos;t impact so badly on the overall experience if the game&apos;s AI wasn&apos;t so good. Not content to stand out in the open and provide the player with an easy target, these drones actually lay down suppressing fire while their mates move to flank the player, and when such action isn&apos;t possible, they hurl grenades to draw the player out of cover. Not only that, they&apos;ll reposition themselves based on where the player takes up a firing position, and if a grenade is tossed at them, they immediately rush out of its blast radius.     Spec Ops The Line    The overall design of Spec Ops: The Line is challenging, too. Some set-pieces take place in environments where enemies have multiple pieces of cover, as well as raised platforms to outflank the players from, and the further into the game the player goes, the more likely they are to encounter bullet-sponge opponents. This wouldn&apos;t be so bad, except for the fact that bullets are very rare in Dubai, apparently, so all the shoot-outs in the game force the player to put a premium on headshots. One could argue that this is more realistic, but that argument falls to pieces when every single downed enemy  who kept the player pinned in cover with a never-ending stream of bullets  seems to have only a couple of slugs left when the player loots their fallen body. One could also argue that Spec Ops: The Line wasn&apos;t designed to be a cakewalk and I shouldn&apos;t whine about a game being challenging, but that&apos;s slight disingenuous. I agree, there&apos;s nothing wrong ramping up the difficulty to provide players with a challenge, but for a game to be challenging rather than unfair, the mechanics the player relies upon need to be rock-solid, and in Spec Ops: The Line, they just aren&apos;t. It may be the case that players will do better against human opponents in the game&apos;s multiplayer mode, but I can&apos;t confirm it at the time of this writing. I&apos;ve battled to get online with the game&apos;s multiplayer and in the rare instances I&apos;ve made it into the lobbies, there have been no other players there. So the question every prospective punter needs to ask themselves ahead of buying Spec Ops: The Line is this  is a cracking story set in an original and atmospheric environment enough to allow you ignore subpar gameplay that occasionally makes the whole experience incredibly frustrating? This is one of those instances where I wish the Guardian&apos;s scoring system allowed me to give a game a 7/10 rating, because that&apos;s really what Spec Ops: The Line deserves. However, since the only choice I have is between a 6 and an 8, I&apos;m going to round the score down, because while there&apos;s some genuine heart and originality in Spec Ops: The Line, the experience of playing the game is just too hit and miss for me to recommend it unreservedly. The developers at Yager have proven they can tell a great story, write interesting characters and build a unique and disturbing world to house them all in. If they can marry these assets to an experience that&apos;s more fluid and fun to play in their next outing, they&apos;ll be flat-out dangerous.  Game reviewed on Xbox 360",

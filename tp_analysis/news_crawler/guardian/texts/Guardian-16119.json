    "text": "   Photograph: supplied    Deciding to pursue a PhD after having my application for funding rejected was a difficult choice to make.I had to take into consideration that I have four young children to provide for, and a wife who is also studying and working. Outside the comfort zone Not receiving funding has, however, been a blessing in disguise, as it&apos;s forced me to avoid complacency and step out of my comfort zone. It has made me look for opportunities that I don&apos;t think I would have looked for had I received funding, and has given me a desire to make myself stand out from the crowd. I am currently teaching undergraduate seminars for the ethics, philosophy and religion module at Lancaster University, and also an intern on the 12m Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council and Economic and Social Research Council funded religion and society programme. Although now ended, it&apos;s provided me with some great experiences, such as helping out at the Westminster Faith Debates. I doubt that I would have even considered getting involved if I had received funding for my PhD. I&apos;ve also become very conscious of having my work recognised by other scholars, so I look for opportunities where I can . This has led to presenting a paper at an international academic conference in Sweden this summer. The whole experience has made me realise what I can actually achieve if I put my mind to it, even if it means simply utilising a spare couple of hours here and there. Not all plain sailing That&apos;s not to say, of course, that it&apos;s all been plain sailing. Money is always an issue, finding motivation at the end of the day to sit down and continue working can often be very difficult, as can finding opportunities to spend quality time with my wife and children. It can be hard, but it&apos;s still very rewarding. There is some pressure to secure funding from other sources such as academic organisations or charities and I&apos;m continually on the lookout for such opportunities. This is due to the fact that there is an increasing expectation for PhD students to show that they can secure funding for research projects as they will be expected to do so later in their academic careers. I remain unsuccessful to date, though I am still in the early stages of my research, so I will continue to look for sources of funding and continue applying for the duration of my studies. Advice for others For anyone considering studying towards a PhD who has been unsuccessful in securing funding, my advice would be to think seriously about the reasons why they are doing it. If I didn&apos;t have the full support of my loved ones, a strong desire to have a successful career in academia, the drive to keep working when I&apos;m exhausted and to remain optimistic when the rejection letters keep coming in, I doubt very much that I would be able to continue with my studies. Having said that, if you have all of these things in place it can be a very rewarding experience as it has led to one of the most fulfilling and exciting times of my life.

    "text": "The countdown to freshers&apos; week has begun  which means if you&apos;re beginning university this autumn, now is the time to start thinking about what to pack. Everyone knows the basics: clothes, a tootbrush and your parents&apos; tin-opener. But do you need to take any important paperwork with you? Some universities ask to see students&apos; exam certificates during induction sessions. You might also need a CRB check, if your course involves working with children, or documents relating to your accommodation. And, talking of student housing, is your bedroom fully furnished? How will you decorate it  traffic cones, fairy lights or piles of books? If you&apos;re self-catered, it&apos;s a good idea to stock up on long-lasting foods such as dried pasta, tinned soups and tea bags. Tupperware, crockery and washing-up liquid are also worth taking. Household items aside, you&apos;ll need plenty of blank notebooks, pens and a decent memory stick. The more you pack now, the less you&apos;ll need to buy during term. What other items should freshers take to uni this September? From coat-hangers to cheese-graters, we want to know.

    "text": "Students across the country are baring all in a week of protests which will force universities to face up to the dire working conditions endured by those who produce student sportswear and university-branded garments. &quot;We thought we&apos;d do something that would grab people&apos;s attention, rather than hanging out all day handing out fliers,&quot; says Paul Greene, from Robert Gordon University, who paraded around his university campus this Monday wearing strategically-placed cardboard signs. Greene, along with students at 30 other UK universities, is calling on his vice-chancellor to join the Worker&apos;s Rights Consortium (WRC) to make sure that factory workers employed by university suppliers are always treated fairly. &quot;We&apos;d rather go naked than wear sweatshop clothing,&quot; says Lauren Stephens, a student at Chester. &quot;Students led the way on Fairtrade, and now they&apos;re taking the lead in putting an end to sweatshops as well.&quot; Like most clothes in the UK market, university clothing is often produced in developing countries where workers are paid little to work long hours in dangerous conditions. But universities could make a difference, says Jim Cranshaw from People and Planet, a student network that campaigns on environmental and human rights issues. He wants universities to use their financial clout to improve worker conditions. &quot;Universities are at the top of the supply chain  they have big contracts with companies, whether it&apos;s with electronics or garment manufacturers, but at the moment they&apos;re not using that position positively to end sweatshop abuses.&quot; &quot;If a university were to join the WRC, a team of inspectors would visit all factories used by university suppliers and provide a whistle-blowing service for workers. If workers were being abused, the WRC could then inform university members so that collectively they could then put pressure on the company involved.&quot; Eight universities  including Sheffield, Cardiff, Bristol, Loughborough, Oxford Brookes, Edinburgh, Sussex, and Birmingham  have already signed up to the WRC, as have 220 student unions and around 180 US universities. Rob Abrams from Swansea University says students want their universities to behave ethically. &quot;Many of us here are studying politics or geography. In lectures, we get taught a lot of very nice things about corporate responsibility, about how companies should care about working conditions. But in reality, this is the complete opposite of what some of the most powerful companies on the planet are doing.&quot;",

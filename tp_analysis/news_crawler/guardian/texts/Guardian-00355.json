    "text": "Australia has thrown its weight behind a bid to outlaw large-scale commercial and so-called scientific whaling at a summit next week.  The International Whaling Commission meeting in Slovenia follows Japans recent slaughter of more than 300 minke whales, many of them pregnant, when they resumed so-called scientific whaling after a hiatus because the International Court of Justice ruled the hunts were not scientific and should cease. Australia has put forward a resolution to the conference that would require Japan to get approval from the IWC for its scientific quotas. Japan is also expected to again face criticism from other countries for its whaling in the Southern Ocean, in defiance of the court ruling.   Related: Japan told to halt Antarctic whaling by international court    On Friday the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said he would call for global protection of whales, saying the government strongly supports the global moratorium and will continue to work towards a permanent end to all forms of commercial and so-called scientific whaling. For too long, the commission has deferred responsibility for so-called scientific whaling to its scientific committee, Frydenberg said. The commission must be more engaged on this important and divisive issue and form its own conclusions. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the global moratorium on commercial whaling and 70 years since the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling was made. In 2008 the Australian federal court found Japanese whaling in the Australian Whale Sanctuary to be in breach of Australian law and Japanese whaling company Kyodo was fined $1m in 2015. Attempts to recover the money have so far failed. Kitty Block, the vice-president of the Humane Society International, which was part of the Australian legal action, said: Japans unilateral resumption of its so-called scientific hunt in the Southern Ocean last year is a slap in the face not just for the International Whaling Commission but also for the rule of law, as the international court of justice clearly ruled Japans previous Antarctic research program to be illegal. Humane Society International program manager Alexia Wellbelove said: With both the international courts and Australias federal court condemning Japans actions, it is time the international community at IWC strongly criticise Japan for its so-called scientific whaling program.",

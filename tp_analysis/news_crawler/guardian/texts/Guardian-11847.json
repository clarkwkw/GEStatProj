    "text": "Dust 514 (PS3), the upcoming first-person-shooter-meets-massively-multiplayer-online-game, will open its beta test to the public on Tuesday. What makes this announcement impressive is that developer CCP Games says it has also managed to integrate the game with EVE Online, the vastly popular PC-based online game, in which players can acquire catastrophically vast and powerful fleets of spaceships. It&apos;s rare that console and PC users are able to wander round the same game space, let alone when one group of players is on foot carrying guns, while the other plies the galaxy in enormous, savagely powerful star ships  Games out this week include Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 Nuketown Zombies (PS3, PC), the irradiated undead-heavy slab of downloadable content already available for Xbox, and SiNG Party (Wii U), a distinctly feature-light karaoke sing &apos;em-up.",

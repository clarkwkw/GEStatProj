    "text": "In America, the most expensive TV advertising slots are during the Super Bowl. It cost around $3.8m for 30 seconds this year. Butit&apos;s thought to be worthit, not just because around 111million people are watching, but also because Super Bowl ads are a bit of a thing  they get talked about. And advertisers like to be talked about (who doesn&apos;t?) Kia did one this year, for the Sorento, presumably because it thinks its larger SUV could do well over in the US. And improve the Korean company&apos;s reputation for building cheap but cheerless cars. The ad goes like this. A family is driving along in their Sorento. Little boy in the back pipes up. &quot;Dad, where do babies come from?&quot; he asks. Dad tells a story of the planet Babylandia, which is inhabited by babies of all varieties, animals included. When they&apos;re ready, they&apos;re blasted to Earth by rocket, ajourney that takes nine months (even though one of the babies is clearly an elephant and so will presumably arrive dangerously prematurely, while the puppy will be overcooked). What&apos;s the message? That Kia drivers kill baby animals as well as being liars? Possibly, though the little boy doesn&apos;t fall for it. &quot;But Jakesaid babies are made when mummies and daddies...&quot; he begins, presumably with the intention of finishing his sentence with a word that begins with an F and rhymes with truck. Quick-thinking Dad interrupts: &quot;Uvo&quot; he says to the car&apos;s voice-activated infotainment system, &quot;play Wheels On The Bus&quot;. Uvo obeys, and the little boy forgets about birds and bees in order to sing along. I think the message is that this is a family-friendly car with enough toys inside to keep everyone entertained and to get you out of difficult situations when required. Which it is. But the ad backfires because it ends up with an external shot of the car driving along, wheels going round (and round) obviously, accompanied by Wheels On The Bus. It&apos;s hard not to think the song isabout the car. And, in a way, it is, because the Sorento is basically a bus, as opposed to a truck (no sniggering at the back), which is what the previous Sorento was. The new one has less pulling power (the literal type, for towing horseboxes, etc, not the sort that can lead to making babies) and is more refined. To drive? Yeah, pretty much like a bus. And it&apos;s about the size of abus, too, with lots of seats (seven if you don&apos;t need lots of luggage space). Which is all fine in the land of the Super Bowl, where they have and need more space. In the narrow lanes of the Chilterns and in London, it was simply too big. And I wasn&apos;t even allowed in the bus lanes.

    "text": "Children from immigrant families in the UK face &quot;significant challenges&quot; in schools which are among the most socially segregated in the developed world, a major annual report has found. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), children from immigrant as well as poorer backgrounds are more likely to be clustered in disadvantaged schools than their counterparts in other countries such as France, Sweden and the Netherlands. The phenomenon is illustrated by statistics in the latest Education at a Glance report, which found that 80% of children of immigrant families in the UK were being taught in schools with large numbers of other immigrant or disadvantaged pupils  the highest proportion of any country in the survey and significantly above the OECD average of 68%. It found that 79.8% of immigrant students whose mothers did not receive a high level of education  five good GCSEs  attended disadvantaged schools. More surprisingly, among those with highly educated mothers, more than twice as many immigrant students as non-immigrant students attended disadvantaged schools  42.5% compared to 18%. More than half of non-immigrant children with mothers not educated beyond GCSE level were also in disadvantaged schools, the report found  a higher proportion than any other country except Canada, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Japan and Slovakia. The report, which has collated data from 2008 and 2009 and compared figures from countries across the developed world, said: &quot;The socioeconomic composition of UK schools poses significant challenges for disadvantaged students and students with an immigrant background.&quot; The OECD warns that high concentrations of disadvantage in schools can have a strong influence on students&apos; outcomes in life. The government hopes its &quot;pupil premium&quot; scheme  which should pump extra money to schools with a large number of disadvantaged students  will help ease the problem, alongside new free schools and academies in deprived areas. The Department for Education said: &quot;We are determined to tackle the appalling gap in attainment and opportunity between the richest and poorest pupils. To do this, we are taking action to give all parents more real choice  We will continue to examine every aspect of the school system to put an end to its inequalities.&quot; The UK was more positively viewed on social mobility, with 41% of 25- to 34-year-olds attaining a higher level of education than their parents, compared with an OECD average of 37%. The likelihood that young people with &quot;low-educated&quot; parents will enrol in higher education was more than 60%, the report added  a level exceeded only by Iceland, Ireland, Portugal and Turkey. &quot;The educational opportunities for people from poorly educated families are limited in most countries, but the UK does better than other countries in moving people up the social ladder,&quot; said the report, adding: &quot;The playing field is far from level in the UK, but compared with most other OECD countries, students in the UK enjoy relatively fluid intergenerational upward mobility.&quot;  Read the full breakdown of data in the report on the Guardian&apos;s data blog.",

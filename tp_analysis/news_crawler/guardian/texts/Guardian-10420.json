    "text": "Today tens of thousands of students are marching in London for the future of education and the welfare state (Report, 19 November). We will take action again on 5 December, when George Osborne delivers his autumn statement. We believe the student movement needs to demand clear, radical alternatives to the coalition&apos;s agenda of privatisation, growing inequality and austerity, and to build unity with others in the struggle against cuts and austerity. We are campaigning for free, accessible and public education, with a living allowance for all students, and a rebuilt welfare state and NHS  funded by taxing the rich and big business  and taking control of the banks&apos; wealth. We draw inspiration from recent student battles from Quebec to Greece and Egypt. But a single demonstration will not be enough to challenge the government&apos;s agenda. We need to make it the start of an ongoing campaign. That is why we are supporting the call for a national day of action involving students and workers at schools, colleges and universities across the country on 5 December.Michael Chessum National Campaign Against Fees and CutsDaniel Cooper University of London unionAlex Peters-Day LSE students union general secretaryJames McAsh Edinburgh University students association presidentMaham Hashmi Soas students unionLuke Durigan NUS higher education committeeLeander Jones Birmingham University guild of students VP democracy and resourcesSara Moon Sheffield University students union development officerEdwin Clifford Coupe UCL union education and campaigns officerDominique Ucbas University of Strathclyde students union VP diversity and advocacyJamie Green Royal Holloway students union VP communications and campaignsNaomi Beecroft Edinburgh University students association women&apos;s officerLuke Frost University of the Creative Arts students union Maidstone officerMike Williamson NUS NECRoshni Joshi NUS NEC  We welcome today&apos;s national student demonstration, called by the NUS. The determination of the student protests in 2010 against the tripling of fees and cutting of education maintenance allowance gave inspiration to everyone opposed to the coalition government&apos;s attacks on education and wider society. In response, the government has pursued a strategy of dissuading students from exercising their right to protest. Police kettles held thousands of school students for hours in freezing conditions, while mounted police charged into the crowds. Middlesex University student Alfie Meadows almost lost his life after being hit on the head with a police truncheon and many young people were dragged through the courts on extremely serious charges. Less publicised were the many cases in which students were vindicated by juries who found them not guilty. These include the Hilliard brothers, who were acquitted of pulling a policeman from his horse in a trial that revealed the hapless officer had slipped from his saddle while pulling one of the boys&apos; hair. This was contrary to David Cameron&apos;s insistence that police had been &quot;dragged off horses and beaten&quot;. Yet the trials continue, with Alfie Meadows and his co-defendant Zak King facing a further trial in February  almost two and a half years after the fees vote. On 5 December George Osborne is expected to announce a further onslaught against the most vulnerable in society. This will require a united and determined response. That is why we will stand with the students, just as they have stood with others in the fight against austerity. Together we shall resist the government&apos;s use of the police and the courts to undermine our right to protest.Len McCluskey UNITE general secretaryChristine Blower NUT general secretaryMark Serwotka PCS general secretaryBilly Hayes CWU general secretaryBob Crow RMT general secretaryJelena Timotijevic UCU NECMark Thomas ComedianCaroline Lucas MPJohn McDonnell MPBilly Bragg MusicianLaurie Penny AuthorZita Holbourne PCS NECLee Hall ScreenwriterPeter Kavanagh Unite regional secretary, London &amp; Eastern RegionLiz Lawrence UCU NECJim Wolfreys UCU King&apos;s College LondonMark Campbell UCU NECTony Kearns CWU deputy general secretary",

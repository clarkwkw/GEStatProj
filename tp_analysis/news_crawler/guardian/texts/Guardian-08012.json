    "text": "Ofqual, the exam regulator, has suggested that the fall in the proportion of pupils getting good grades in GCSE English was partly caused by pupils from private and selective schools taking an alternative exam. Glenys Stacey, Ofqual&apos;s chief regulator, said that the decision by about 20,000 pupils to reject GCSE English in favour of another qualification, such as the international GCSE (iGCSE), was one of several factors that created &quot;particular difficulties&quot; for examiners trying to mark papers fairly this summer. She insisted that the decisions that led to the proportion of students getting from A* to C in English falling by 1.5% were not politically motivated. But she said it would be best to avoid such a situation recurring in the future and, in a letter to the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) released at the weekend, she said the move away from modular exams would help to prevent this happening again. The proportion of pupils getting good GCSEs fell overall this year for the first time in the exam&apos;s 26-year history, but there has been a particular outcry about English, where thousands of pupils failed to get a C after the grade boundaries were lifted sharply between the exams sat in January and those sat in June. Some local authorities have indicated that a legal case could be brought against the regulator. In her letter to Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT, promising an urgent review of grade C boundary setting, Stacey said that Ofqual was committed to a &quot;comparable outcomes approach&quot;  meaning that pupils should get the same grade sitting an exam as they would have done had they sat the exam the previous year. She said that Ofqual had started discussing this two years ago and that it was not responding to political pressure from Michael Gove, the education secretary. &quot;Some people have suggested that the decision to move to a comparable outcomes approach was a rushed decision, or a politically motivated one,&quot; she said. &quot;This was not the case.&quot; Stacey said that using the comparable outcomes approach for modular exams was &quot;always a challenge&quot;. That was because modular qualifications involved exams being taken in stages, not all at once at the end of a course, and examiners therefore had to adjust grade boundaries at the end when some marks had already been awarded. But GCSE English presented &quot;particular difficulties&quot; this summer, she said. &quot;This year there were significant changes, including the introduction of an English GCSE alongside new English language and English literature GCSEs,&quot; she said. &quot;There was also an increase in the numbers of students taking other qualifications such as iGCSEs, and there were changes in entry patterns, which all means that the cohorts were not comparable from year to year. Setting standards when things change in this way is not always trouble free.&quot; Ofqual said that around 20,000 pupils from independent schools and selective schools had given up GCSE English for an alternative qualification, even though the overall number of pupils taking the qualification had risen. In her letter, Stacey told Hobby that she agreed with him that &quot;we should seek to avoid situations like this in the future&quot;. She said Gove&apos;s decision to move away from the modular exam system at GCSE would address this. &quot;There is always the risk of these difficulties with a modular system,&quot; she said. &quot;As you know, we will be moving away from modular GCSEs after the forthcoming school year. In future, the exam boards will only be making grading decisions in the summer.&quot; On Sunday the Department for Education welcomed Ofqual&apos;s decision to review the grade C boundary setting in English.",

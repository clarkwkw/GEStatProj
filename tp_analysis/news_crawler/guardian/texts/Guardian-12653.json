    "text": "For those planning to subject themselves to the disappointment of Aliens: Colonial Marines, new DLC has already been announced for next month in the form of co-operativebased Bug Hunt, to be followed by three more packs by the end of the summer. Scribblenauts Unlimited (reviewed last week) has now been delayed indefinitely, along with fellow Wii U release Rayman Legends, giving Nintendo&apos;s new console a February release schedule populated by tumbleweed. Actually out this week are City Builder (PC), a kind of sim building site rather than sim city; Botanicula: Collector&apos;s Edition (PC &amp; Mac), the charmingly drawn point-and-click adventure from the makers of the Machinarium; and Persona 4: Golden (Vita), a gripping game of teenage intrigue and supernatural combat in a rustic Japanese town. Possibly the strangest and most interesting release of the year so far.",

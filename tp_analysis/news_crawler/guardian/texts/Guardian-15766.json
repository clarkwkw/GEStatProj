    "text": "One of Britain&apos;s trailblazing headteachers, who had been lauded by Tony Blair, stepped down from her post after allegations of financial mismanagement that have overshadowed what had appeared to be a brilliant career at two schools in London. Jo Shuter, 52, headteacher of Quintin Kynaston academy in St John&apos;s Wood, north London, since 2002, issued a statement announcing her resignation on the school&apos;s website on Monday only days after she was reinstated following a long disciplinary procedure and eight months&apos; suspension. She was said to be on an annual salary of 170,000. The allegations first emerged last September, highlighting the dangers that the new breed of academies face in maintaining budget controls once overseen by local authorities through strictly controlled spending guidelines. During her time as headteacher, Quintin Kynaston academy received repeated ratings of &quot;outstanding&quot; from Ofsted inspectors. Shuter was named headteacher of the year in the Teaching Awards in 2007 and in 2010 she was awarded a CBE. Blair made two visits to Quintin Kynaston as prime minister, in 2003, when he used the school as the venue for launching his children&apos;s services green paper, and in 2006, telling staff the school was &quot;a wonderful inspiration&quot;. But late last month the government&apos;s school spending watchdog, the Education Funding Agency (EFA), issued a damning report detailing loose accounting and spending controls at the school, including 3,000 spent on flowers since 2011. The EFA&apos;s report found that between January 2011 and August 2012, the school spent 11,500 on travel, 8,400 of which was not on school business. That total was said to include trips taken by Shuter to the Ivy restaurant and the Savoy hotel in London, some of which was repaid later. The EFA also found that a bill for nearly 7,000 was incurred by the school for Shuter&apos;s 50th party, and only paid back more than a year later. The report also found that seven members of Shuter&apos;s family, including her mother and children, had been employed in one form or another by the school. The investigation had been triggered by a whistleblower. &quot;Funding provided to benefit the needs of the academy pupils has, in fact, been diverted for inappropriate purposes,&quot; the EFA concluded after its investigation. In her statement, Shuter said: &quot;It is with sadness and regret that I have taken the difficult decision to tender my resignation as Headteacher of QK Academy following the governors&apos; decision to reinstate me after lengthy investigation. &quot;My 11 years of headship have been a source of pride and happiness.&quot; In a measured statement, Patrick Lees, chair of the academy&apos;s board of governors, referred to &quot;a lengthy and robust disciplinary process&quot; leading to a sanction of an indefinite final written warning given to Shuter. &quot;Whilst we as the governing body have reinstated Jo, following the publication of the EFA report last week Jo felt her position at QK had become untenable,&quot; Lees wrote in a statement. &quot;She has today proffered her resignation, which we have accepted.&quot; The governors are now looking to appoint a new principal. Lees went on to assure parents that the school&apos;s financial controls would be strengthened &quot;under new management&quot;. Shuter&apos;s dual role of headteacher and school accounting officer had allowed her wide powers over the school&apos;s spending. She had been one of the youngest headteachers in the country when she took the job in 2002. By 2005 the BBC had commissioned a documentary on Shuter&apos;s role as headteacher, named Head on the Block. But it was forced to scrap the film before it was broadcast after it emerged that the documentary was produced by Shuter&apos;s sister Debbie, and was directed by her sister&apos;s partner. According to the EFA investigation, Shuter appeared to have blurred the boundaries between personal and professional resources. &quot;It is clear that the personal use of the academy taxi accounts was widespread before the school became an academy, continued after conversion, and that, until prompted, by the bursar, there was no attempt to ensure that all personal costs incurred had been identified and repaid,&quot; the EFA reported. The school also held overnight meetings in hotels in Hertfordshire, which cost 8,000, and London&apos;s Landmark Hotel, costing 4,400. The report also said Shuter received about 15,000 for consultancy and speaking fees during school time.",

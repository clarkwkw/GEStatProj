    "text": "The leader of one of the country&apos;s largest teachers&apos; unions has rounded on Michael Gove, the education secretary, over his &quot;unparalleled vicious assault&quot; on teachers, schools and state education. Chris Keates, the NASUWT general secretary, used her speech to the union&apos;s annual conference in Birmingham to unleash a hard-hitting attack against Gove as she vented teachers&apos; anger over a slew of policy initiatives introduced over the past two years that have put unions on a collision course with the government. Both NASUWT and the National Union of Teachers have used their annual conference to confirm their ongoing commitment to take industrial action over government plans to reform their pension schemes. NASUWT&apos;s ballot also enables members to strike over pay and work-related issues, while the NUT is due to consider industrial action over pay at its conference in Torquay on Monday. Keates told the conference that Gove, &quot;sometimes acting alone, or sometimes engaging in gang-related activity with his ministerial colleagues, has wrought havoc on our education and other public services&quot;. Citing a roll-call of grievances, Keates said teachers&apos; professional status was now being eroded &quot;on all levels&quot;, with teachers told &quot;what to teach, how to teach and when to teach, often by those who have not taught for years&quot;. &quot;They are monitored to destruction by an army of adults and even the children they teach,&quot; she said. Keates said Gove had &quot;deliberately failed to make clear to parents and the public the inextricable link between teachers&apos; pay and working conditions and the provision of high quality education&quot;. She told delegates: &quot;If teachers are to be recruited and retained they need pay levels which recognise and reward them as highly skilled professionals. They need working conditions which enable them to work effectively to raise standards. Savage cuts have been made to education budgets with thousands of jobs lost or at risk. Specialist services on which schools and some of the most vulnerable in our society rely have been reduced or disappeared completely.&quot; &quot;A four-year pay freeze has been imposed and is set to continue regardless of the state of the economy.&quot; Turning to pensions, Keates she said sustainable pensions schemes have been &quot;torn up&quot; and the public fed &quot;a diet of myths and misinformation&quot;. The average pension for a teacher was just 10,000, she said. Keates quipped that the only positive thing she could think to say about the education secretary was that he was the union&apos;s &quot;new poster boy&quot;, citing the surge in recruitment since he took over the department. She added: &quot;The secretary of state sends his apologies but he has insisted that all ministers take a break over Easter. They have all been working really hard. Demolishing state schools really takes it out of you.&quot;",

    "text": "Over the past 20 years the rag-and-bone trade has had a makeover. Phase one was triggered by the rise of fast-fashion consumerism, when we bought in bulk at low cost and discarded clothes quickly. The lion&apos;s share of our cast-offs was slung into landfill (900,000 to 1.2m tonnes a year still ends up there), but the portion we donated to charities put huge pressure on their recycling systems, not least because the clothing was of very low quality. Despite being barely worn, it was hard to sell to British consumers, especially when they could buy new from the high street for the same price. Swamped by old vest tops, many charities turned to private waste processors to do their recycling and sell it to developing countries, receiving a percentage of profits. But the charities still owned the bins and banks. On average, a bag of donated clothes processed in this way earns a charity around 7. We have now entered phase two. Recyclers report a slight drop in donations, and old clothes command record prices. Some cash-strapped councils have also called time on free pitches for charity clothing bins. Yours is one of these. It has been replaced by collections for private waste contractors. Some will give a percentage of proceeds to charities, but this is substantially smaller than if the charity controls the bin itself. If you can&apos;t beat them, join them. That seems to be the mantra of the Salvation Army (SATCoL is its clothing recycling division), which has just splashed out on a textile sorting company, Kettering Textiles, in order to have 100% control. Not every charity has the funds and knowledge to do this. They are in a battle for your old threads. Warring factions include cash-for-clothes collections which bypass charities and high-street fashion companies re-using clothing, fibres and scraps. This makes sense when prices for raw materials such as cotton are so high, and it is a bit of an eco victory. But our hearts go out to the charities. Profits from donated clothes are already lost to bogus collectors and now their cash cow is pursued by all manner of fibre hunters. So next month a consortium of 7,000 shops launches a Choose Charity Shops campaign, urging us to take clothes straight into the store. Most donated clothes will be sold to the huge secondhand clothing markets in developing countries, but it keeps the charity of your choice in the game. Green crush of the week The earth has an extraordinary defender in eco explorer Pen Hadow. His expeditions, including a 2003 solo trek from Canada to the Geographic North Pole (he&apos;s the only man to have done this), have contributed significantly to environmental and climate science. In preparation for another record-setting polar exploit and scientific survey in 2013, he is doing an eco ultramarathon (as ambassador for the Royal Parks Foundation) in October. For the man who has swum through ice and hauled sledges for 1,200km it will surely be a walk in the park. penhadow.com",

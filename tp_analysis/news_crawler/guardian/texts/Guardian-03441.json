    "text": "In the world of hardcore console titles, where narrative and mechanical intricacy remain dominant design trends, Trials Evolution remains determinedly and exquisitely simple. A hybrid of automotive and platforming game conventions, this motorcycling title centres on the basic concept of driving in a single direction on a two-dimensional plane. Assuming the role of the virtual rider, using little more than the ability to shift their bodyweight on the bike, the player must traverse a wealth of obstacles to progress in a world where the physics of gravity, friction and balance come together to exert their dictatorial control over gameplay. The rudiments of Trials Evolution may sound straightforward, but the game&apos;s world of intertwined ramps and enormous jumps offers a remarkably nuanced and exciting experience. The precision of control that can be achieved by manipulating these elementary forces is remarkable and, in combination with gameworld physics that are elegantly refined, makes for a constantly rewarding experience full of variety. Moreover, for those concerned that Evolution simply duplicates the form of the previous Trials game without innovation, fear not. A wealth of multiplayer modes and an outstandingly elaborate level editor means this sequel comfortably trumps its forebear. A simple but brilliant piece of entertainment.",

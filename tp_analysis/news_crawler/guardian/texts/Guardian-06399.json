[David] Glazer: &quot;We deeply wanted to be sure we were building a platform that worked for developers. And at the same time, we knew there were a couple of failure modes around doing that. The obvious failure mode is &apos;don&apos;t give you tools.&apos; That&apos;s an easy one to avoid, and this question is saying &apos;I want more tools&apos; - understood.  &quot;But there are some other failure modes we&apos;ve seen out there, and one of them is to provide tools before we know if it&apos;s a good idea and then to change our mind, and then to change our mind again, and then to change our mind again. The other failure mode we&apos;ve seen is that it&apos;s possible with a platform that has insufficient guidelines or tone or doesn&apos;t nudge the experience in the right direction to build something that creates a tragedy of the commons, where the more [that] people build on the platform, the more it hurts the overall community. Once we know what sticks, we&apos;re comfortable opening up more widely.&quot;  [Bradley] Horowitz: &quot;We have a very high velocity team. You don&apos;t want to be chasing after a moving target.&quot;  Wikipedia article traffic statistics for the top 1,000 pages Really quite scary. Yahoo CEO search in final stages, with Levinsohn and Kilar in lead &gt;&gt; AllThingsD  According to sources close to the situation, the search for a new CEO for troubled Internet giant Yahoo is closing in on several key candidates in the mix.  But, said sources inside and outside the company, it appears to be coming down to a contest between interim CEO Ross Levinsohn and Hulu CEO Jason Kilar.   Aren&apos;t you just thrilling at the white-hot rivalry for... oh, forget it. Olympus and Apple join Google with wearable computing &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  The Meg 4.0 requires a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone, which is then used to share information back to the Olympus display. Pricing and a release date were not discussed in the release.  Meanwhile, Apple also seems to be working on wearable computers.   It&apos;s the next wave. Get ready. Gadgets: Failure to Launch &gt;&gt; Pinterest Ross Rubin:  These are products that looked promising but either never hit the market or were withdrawn within months launch.   He&apos;s @rossrubin on Twitter. Let him know if you have any others to suggest. (Also: three Pinterest links in a day?) Find and Call: Leak and Spam &gt;&gt; Securelist  Yesterday we were contacted by our partner MegaFon, one of the major mobile carriers in Russia. They notified us about a suspicious application, which was found in both the Apple App Store and Google Play. At first glance, this seemed to be an SMS worm spread via sending short messages to all contacts stored in the phone book with the URL to itself.  However, our analysis of the iOS and Android versions of the same application showed that it&apos;s not an SMS worm but a Trojan that uploads a user&apos;s phonebook to remote server. The &apos;replication&apos; part is done by the server - SMS spam messages with the URL to the application are being sent from the remote server to all the contacts in the user&apos;s address book.   Kaspersky says it&apos;s the first malware they&apos;ve ever seen in the App Store; it was also seen on Google Play. Apple has removed the app, though it had been there since 13 June. The developer apparently claimed the behaviour was a &quot;bug&quot; - though you&apos;d think they&apos;d have noticed that &quot;bug&quot; quite soon. CityDashboard: Birmingham Also available: Brighton, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Manchester. A UCL/JISC/NeISS/CASA production. Rather neat. Minneapolis street test: Google gets a B+, Apple&apos;s Siri gets a D &gt;&gt; Fortune Tech  Piper Jaffray published the results Thursday in a note to clients:  o Google understands 100% of the questions (not surprisingly, since they are keyed in)  o Google replies accurately 86% of the time  o Siri comprehends 83% of queries in noisy conditions, 89% in a quiet room  o Siri answers accurately 62% of the time on the street and 68% in a quiet room.  &quot;In order to become a viable mobile search alternative,&quot; Munster writes, &quot;Siri must match or surpass Google&apos;s accuracy of B+ and move from a grade D to a B or higher.&quot;   Hang on, Google is only accurate 86% of the time? Something is wrong on the internet. Google Graveyard &gt;&gt; Frank Shaw&apos;s Pinterest Frank Shaw is Microsoft&apos;s head of PR. A very clever use of social media. At the time of bookmarking, it&apos;s out of date - we noted on Wednesday that iGoogle and others are on the way out too. Microsoft Morgue &gt;&gt; Harry McCracken&apos;s Pinterest Awesome, in all its senses. Google wouldn&apos;t respond to Frank Shaw, so McCracken, a journalist, did. Google annoys Opera users who won&apos;t switch to Chrome &gt;&gt; ZDNet  I downloaded the Opera browser and dusted off my old, rarely used Blogger account to confirm that this behavior is indeed occurring. And you cannot make those nagging messages go away. Any visit to a page in the Blogger content-editing interface results in this nag screen, and although you can dismiss the message, it will keep coming back until you finally decide that the headache isn&apos;t worth it and click the &quot;try Google Chrome&quot; link that Google has helpfully provided for you. This is how monopolies work. Google&apos;s competitive position in online advertising is so impenetrable that Microsoft was forced earlier this week to take a $6.2-billion write-off as an acknowledgment that its $6-billion acquisition of Aquantive in 2007 had failed to make a dent in AdWords, DoubleClick, and other Google-owned advertising networks. Opera has negligible market share in desktop computing, tallying only 1.6% and 1.77% in the latest numbers from Net Market Share and StatCounter, respectively. But it&apos;s a mark of pure arrogance from a company that isn&apos;t afraid to act like Microsoft (1998) when it needs to muscle out a competitor. The Google roadblock for Opera is crude. If you change the User-Agent string for Opera so that it identifies itself as Google Chrome, the Blogger editing and management screens work perfectly.   It&apos;s the last paragraph that&apos;s the killer there. Behaviour first noticed by Bob Leggitt. &quot;First they came for the Opera users, and I said nothing...&quot; Revenue for Apple, Microsoft, Intel and Google over the past 20 years &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans Simple comparison; tells an interesting story.

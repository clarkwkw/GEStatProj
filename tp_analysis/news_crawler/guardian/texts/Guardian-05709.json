    "text": "Microsoft is challenging Amazon&apos;s dominance of the ebook industry with a $300m (185m) investment in Barnes &amp; Noble&apos;s Nook reader and college textbook businesses. News of the deal sent shares in Barnes &amp; Noble up 76% from $13.68 to $24.09 in US morning trading on Monday, boosting the bookseller&apos;s value by almost $900m, from $823m on Friday close to $1.7bn by midday. Microsoft&apos;s stock rose 2 cents to $32. The pair have teamed up to create a subsidiary, provisionally named Newco, which could eventually be spun off. Microsoft will own 17.6% of the equity. As part of the deal, which ends a number of lawsuits between the two, the software manufacturer will also include a Nook reader application in the next version of Microsoft Windows, to be released in the autumn. Having a favourable position on the default pages of new Windows computers is likely to give Nook a major boost, say analysts. &quot;It gives them a much larger partner with deeper pockets, it gives them increased reach,&quot; said Peter Wahlstrom at Morningstar. &quot;In the last two years they&apos;ve had their backs against the wall.&quot; The agreement gives Barnes &amp; Noble ammunition to fend off shareholders who have been urging the bookseller to sell the Nook business  or even the entire company. It will also ease concerns that Barnes &amp; Noble lacks the capital to compete with the ebook industry&apos;s market leader, Amazon Kindle. However, the Nook is likely to struggle to seriously challenge Amazon&apos;s estimated 60% of the ebook market. For Microsoft, the investment means it will own a stake in a company that sells tablet computers based on Google&apos;s Android mobile software  one of the main competitors of Windows Phone, Microsoft&apos;s smartphone software. There is a Nook application for Windows PCs, but none for Windows Phone devices. William Lynch, Barnes &amp; Noble&apos;s chief executive, said Nook software will continue to be available on devices such as the iPhone, which competes with Windows Phone. Barnes &amp; Noble has had some success with its e-book sales and Nook e-readers, which are estimated to account for 25% of the US ebook market. One key area it dominates is university textbooks, with its Nook Study offering. Microsoft has a long-standing interest in ebooks, having launched the software in 2000. However it was never able to build a substantial library and is discontinuing its product on 30 August. Barnes &amp; Noble has 691 bookstores in 50 states and the subsidiary company will have an ongoing relationship with the bookseller&apos;s stores. Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: &quot;The whole reason the Nook business is expanding so rapidly is because bookstores are committed to it and know how to market the product in that environment.&quot; Speculation has circled recently about a possible separation of Barnes &amp; Noble&apos;s digital and college businesses. In March, G Asset Management, a private investment firm and Barnes &amp; Noble shareholder, offered $460m for a 51% stake in the company&apos;s college bookstore unit, Barnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers LLC. Under that plan the unit would begin as a private business but become public within a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time. G Asset&apos;s offer was contingent upon Barnes &amp; Noble keeping current management in place and divesting its Nook e-business. At the time the offer was made, Barnes &amp; Noble declined to comment.",

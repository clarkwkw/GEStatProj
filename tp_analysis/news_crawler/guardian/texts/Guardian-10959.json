    "text": "It&apos;s time for our roundup of new Android apps, and from this week we&apos;re making some changes: games will be included in the post, rather than being hived off in their own multi-platform article. That means we should be able to offer a list of 30 new apps every week, while keeping the quality high. This week&apos;s is certainly a cracking selection, showing the innovation that&apos;s happening on Android at the moment. A warning about prices, especially on games: if you see (free) it often means freemium, as in in-app purchases. Wondering about iOS apps? Check this week&apos;s Best iPhone and iPad Apps post. Here&apos;s this week&apos;s roundup: Etsy (free) Crafty commerce site Etsy has a thriving community of buyers and sellers online, as well as on iOS. Now its app is available on Android too, providing a window into its catalogue of 17m+ items for sale. A clean and elegant design keeps the focus firmly on the items. Heroes of Order &amp; Chaos (free) Gameloft&apos;s Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA a genre you&apos;ll be hearing more about on smartphones and tablets in 2013) game sees you forming gangs for fantasy battling, in a world based on the company&apos;s existing World of Warcraft-like Order &amp; Chaos Online game. Expect heroes, monsters and upgrades a-plenty. Finger Hoola (0.69) Finger Hoola is a different kind of game entirely: one that sees you tracing shapes on-screen hula hoop-style to the strains of ambient music. As much a way to relax for a few minutes out of sight of your inbox as a game, it&apos;s very good indeed. Top Gear SSR (free) Top Gear Stunt School Revolution has been a hit on iOS, and now it&apos;s available on Android too. It&apos;s a driving game based (loosely) on the BBC series, meaning the emphasis is on eye-popping stunts, often with a dash of the surreal. Snapseed (free) Photo-sharing app Snapseed&apos;s developer Nik Software was acquired by Google earlier this year, making this (sort of) Google&apos;s in-house rival to Instagram. By which I mean taking and sharing photos while applying visual filters and borders, with a strong tie-in to the Google+ social network. Candy Crush Saga (free) King.com&apos;s Candy Crush Saga has been a huge hit on Facebook, and recently made the leap to iOS. Now it&apos;s on Android too, albeit in beta so don&apos;t be surprised if you spot the odd bug. The gameplay sees you matching sweets over more than 100 levels, with social features high in the mix to compare your efforts to your friends. Clay Jam (free) In what&apos;s already looking like another good month for Android gaming, Clay Jam is the latest title from Zynga, through its publishing deal with developer Fat Pebble. It&apos;s a claymation-style action game that sees you rolling and bouncing the hero down a series of hills. The visuals make it stand out from the crowd, but the gameplay delivers on this promise too. Zenonia 5 (free) Gamevil&apos;s Zenonia has become one of the biggest and best mobile-only RPG franchises over the last couple of years, with this fifth iteration deserving to win even more fans round. It has a huge world to explore, more monsters than you can shake a stick/sword/spell at, and global player-versus-player match-ups for a social spin. 23snaps - Family Photo Book (free) More photo-sharing, but this time with a focus on families. It&apos;s an app designed to help parents share snaps of their kids with family and close friends, as an alternative to slapping them up on Facebook (although, if you&apos;re on top of your group settings, it&apos;s possible there too). This beta app works very well though, with its value as much about browsing back through the photos later, as the actual sharing at the time. Falcon Pro for Twitter (0.64) &quot;The Ultimate Twitter Experience on Android&quot;? That&apos;s quite a claim, but Falcon Pro does have the features to convince power users to give it a try as an alternative to the official Twitter Android app. Tuned for the Android OS, it&apos;s smooth to use, with some nifty features including in-app preview of links to the Google Play store. PSY Gangnam Style LWP and Tone (1.49) Normally, I wouldn&apos;t look twice at a Gangnam Style live wallpaper on Android, assuming it to be an unlicensed ripoff. But no, this one&apos;s official, launched by music startup Bandsintown with the Korean star&apos;s blessing. It features the elevator scene from 2012&apos;s most viral music video, as well as turning your homescreen into &quot;a multicoloured disco floor with PSY performing his trademark dance moves&quot; whenever a text message or Gmail notification arrives. Yes, that sounds horrifying, but this will probably be popular nonetheless. Slice Keyboard (3.11) There are a number of popular keyboard replacement apps on Android, so Slice Keyboard faces ferocious competition. But it&apos;s an interesting approach to the challenge of touchscreen typing: a blank &quot;home row&quot; to place your fingers on, determining where other keys appear. Splice (1.86) The original version of Splice is one of the best puzzle games money can buy on the iPad, so its move to Android is big, exciting news for anyone with a Google-powered tablet. The game sees you manipulating microbial cells to create shapes (or &quot;splices&quot;) over more than 75 levels. Brain-bending, but brilliant. McAfee SafeKey (free) Something more serious here: a tool from security firm McAfee to help you remember your passwords for various sites. It requires a licence to use the McAfee All Access Security service, mind. Moleheart (free) This is another game from Korean publisher Gamevil, promising &quot;defence gaming on a whole different level&quot;. So yes, tower defence a crowded genre on Android already but with RPG-style levelling up and skills for your characters to give the action a twist. Yesterday (1.99) Bulkypix&apos;s point-and-click adventure that should be swipe-and-tap really is one of the best-looking games released for Android this year, as you investigate a series of murders in New York. It&apos;s rich and immersive, and feels like it&apos;s been designed for touchscreen tablet play, rather than being in thrall to the PC roots of the genre. NeroKwik (free) A third photo-sharing app this week, this has more of a cloud storage focus: &quot;Snap a photo with one device and have it available immediately across all your devices,&quot; as the Google Play listing puts it. Looks like the kind of app Yahoo! should have turned Flickr into long ago. Jewel Quest Heritage (1.87) Bejeweled may be the premier match-three-gems puzzle game franchise in 2012, but Jewel Quest is another veteran of the genre. This latest version offers more than 175 boards of jewels to clear and three modes of play. Squeebles Spelling Test (1.49) KeyStageFun&apos;s Squeebles apps have been putting a friendly face on education for young children across iOS and Android. This latest app focuses on spelling you may have guessed this from the title with a series of tests, and a storyline wrapped around them about rescuing colourful animals. There are no in-app purchases, ads or internet links, to reassure parents. Ink Over Apps (0.62) Here&apos;s an idea: &quot;draw, markup, and annotate any app on your device ... like using a sharpie on your screen, but without the mess and ruined screens&quot;. Well, quite. But there&apos;s something interesting here: the ability to scribble on top of, say, documents for work or photos for fun, then save the results as screenshots. Spellwood: Word Game Adventure (1.49) Sega&apos;s new word game Spellwood mixes magic with letters, as you fight battles using your linguistic skills. It includes a solo mode, but the real fun is to be had playing asynchronously against friends, Words With Friends-style. World Ark Magazine (free) Nonprofit organisation Heifer International has launched its own digital magazine app this week, designed to highlight issues of hunger and poverty, as well as some of the work it&apos;s doing to alleviate them. The stylish app includes infographics and videos alongside the standard text/photo features. iPNP 2012 (1.87) Portable North Pole is a big deal for many parents: a site that lets them order videos from Santa Claus to their children in a (possibly doomed) effort to keep them behaving well in the run-up to Christmas. This app is a way to create those video messages, but also play with other festive content, including an advent calendar. Raiden Legacy (3.62) Here&apos;s a retro-gaming treat: four of the Raiden arcade games from back in the day bundled into one app. That means vertically scrolling shoot &apos;em ups with a plethora of ships, game modes and reworked controls for touchscreen devices. Sync.ME -Facebook Contact Sync (Free) This is a simple but potentially useful app to pull down photos and information from your contacts&apos; Facebook profiles, including their latest status updates, which can be handy when calling someone you haven&apos;t seen in a while. Insta Moments-Note Everything (Free) Insta Moments makes big promises: &quot;A perfect and beautiful way to note everything &amp; organize your personal notepad ... A step ahead from Evernote.&quot; Tough to deliver on, but this has some interesting features, from diary dates to social sharing. Tyype Keyboard (1.21) Here&apos;s another typing app for Android, but rather than replace the keyboard entirely, this merely adds a touchpad-style zone underneath the virtual keys, where you can move the cursor around and manipulate text. Spell Sword (free) Spell Sword is the work of casual games firm Miniclip: &quot;A tale of a sword mighty enough to destroy hordes of minions with a single blow...&quot; Which means a platform-based hack &apos;n&apos; slasher inspired by the good old days of gaming, with 90 missions to work your way through. Explore 140 (free) OneLouder reckons it&apos;s worked out why a lot of people don&apos;t use Twitter: &quot;Boring timelines full of lame people.&quot; Is Explore 140 the solution though? It&apos;s trying to provide an easy way to look up people and lists on Twitter, to find people worth following. A good idea, but one you&apos;d expect Twitter&apos;s official app to get better at in time. Freeze! (free) It&apos;s been a very good year for brain-taxing puzzles on Android, with Freeze! the latest to hit the Google Play store. It sees you rotating the world around the game&apos;s unnamed hero, while using a freeze button to pause gravity when appropriate. Very fun, with an excellent and atmospheric soundtrack to boot.",

    "text": "If you grew up playing computer games in the early eighties, you will know Elite, the legendary space trading simulation written by two Cambridge university students, David Braben and Ian Bell. Now, Braben has announced that his studio, Frontier Developments, is working on a new title in the series, and is looking to raise 1.25m on the crowd-funding site, Kickstarter, to make it happen. In his Kickstarter pitch for the game, Braben explains that the original title took up less than 22k when it was released on the BBC Micro in 1984  less memory than the average email message. His ambition is to replicate the unique experience of that first adventure, but with all the extra graphical and scale possibilities modern hardware offers. Set for release on PC in 2014, players will be able to fight and trade their way across several galaxies, either in single-player or in a new multiplayer mode. &quot;Elite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time,&quot; Braben explains on Kickstarter. &quot;The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too&quot;. In the text, Braben admits that his company has made several attempts to resurrect the series since the disappointing third title, Frontier: First Encounters, was released in 1995. &quot;We&apos;re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so&quot;. Kickstarter has become a popular means of testing the enthusiasm of fan communities for retro titles. York-based studio Revolution Software was recently successful in funding a new addition to the Broken Sword series of point-and-click adventure titles via Kickstarter, while US developer Double Fine raised over $3m on the site when it invited fans to pledge on another retro-style adventure.  Already, Braben&apos;s Kickstarter page, which offers gamers the chance to contribute funds to the project in return for copies of the game and other perks, has received over 100,000 in support, with 59 days to go before the funding window closes. The project has also received a significant boost thanks to influential indie coder Markus &apos;Notch&apos; Persson, who tweeted on Tuesday morning, &quot;Well, ok then! Throwing all my money at a new Elite game by David Braben&quot; with a link to the Kickstarter page.  However, the appeal has been criticised by some for lacking solid detail about the development status, and also for the tone of the pitch. Comedian and gamer Robert Florence has launched a string of tweets pillorying the way the project has been presented. &quot;I&apos;m David Braben. Remember Elite? Give me a million pounds,&quot; states one.  For Elite fanatics, though, the prospect of another instalment in the space trading adventure will be too tempting to resist. Already two backers have offered the maximum 5000 pitch each for the chance to have dinner with Braben and members of the development team. Nostalgia has become a powerful currency in the digital gaming era, with publishers cut out of the equation by veteran developers keen to engage directly with fans.  The big question now is whether the project can ascend past the &apos;Mostly Harmless&apos; phase of its Kickstarter appeal and on to Competent, Dangerous and finally, Elite.",

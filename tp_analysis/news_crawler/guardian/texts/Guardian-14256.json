    "text": "In this week&apos;s edition of Science Weekly, Camila Ruz reports from the Huilo Huilo Ecological Reserve in the rainforests of Chile where a conservation project is dedicated to saving the strangest of the frog species, Darwin&apos;s frog. This report was made possible thanks to the generosity of multimedia producer Nisha Ligon. Camila also meets science writer Tim Radford to discuss Richard Fortey&apos;s classic book The Earth ahead of the Guardian Science Book Club&apos;s turn at this year&apos;s Cambridge Word Fest on 14 April. Tickets are still available  click here to find out more. We hear from Emily Anthes on the thorny subject of genetically modified animals as she discusses her new book Frankenstein&apos;s Cat. Finally, Camila is joined by Elspeth Robertson, a volcanology and geophysics PhD student at the University of Bristol, to discuss some of this week&apos;s big science news stories including researchers who claim to be able to map our dreams and a new understanding of the effects of global warming on Antarctic ice.

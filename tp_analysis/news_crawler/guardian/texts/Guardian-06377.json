But before we go into details, let&apos;s start with a quiz:The Dalai Lama walks into an Apple Store. Why?   It does make sense, honest. More to the point: it seems that Mac-using activists are being targeted by Chinese-written malware. Spring cleaning in summer &gt;&gt; Official Google Blog More services being axed: iGoogle (dying 1 November); Symbian Search App; Google Talk Chatback (embedded chat in websites); Google Mini (part of enterprise search); and, drum roll, Google Video - which preceded YouTube and was rapidly superseded by it. Crikey: EU rules you can resell downloaded games &gt;&gt; Rock, Paper, Shotgun  Well here&apos;s some pretty huge news. The Court Of Justice of the European Union has just ruled that people should be able to resell downloaded games. In an environment where publishers are trying to destroy basic consumer rights like the ability to resell physical products you&apos;ve paid for, this could be one heck of a turnaround for customers. And that&apos;s no matter what it might say in the EULAs. This could have absolutely enormous implications on how services like Steam, Origin, GamersGate and the like work, and finally restore some rights back to the gamer.   Only if you can find the original packaging, though. Google patent filing would identify faces in videos, spot the You in YouTube &gt;&gt; Engadget  Face detection is a common sight in still photography, but it&apos;s a rarity in video outside of certain research projects. Google may be keen to take some of the mystery out of those clips through a just-published patent application: its technique uses video frames to generate clusters of face representations that are attached to a given person. By knowing what a subject looks like from various angles, Google could then attach a name to a face whenever it shows up in a clip, even at different angles and in strange lighting conditions.  RIP Computer Science &gt;&gt; Andy Hedges (It&apos;s a big photo. Resize.) Microsoft&apos;s Downfall: Inside the executive e-mails and cannibalistic culture that felled a tech giant &gt;&gt; Vanity Fair blog  Eichenwald&apos;s conversations reveal that a management system known as &quot;stack ranking&quot;--a program that forces every unit to declare a certain percentage of employees as top performers, good performers, average, and poor - effectively crippled Microsoft&apos;s ability to innovate. &quot;Every current and former Microsoft employee I interviewed - every one - cited stack ranking as the most destructive process inside of Microsoft, something that drove out untold numbers of employees,&quot; Kurt Eichenwald writes.   A big piece coming up in Vanity Fair&apos;s August issue (on the streets very soon). It&apos;ll probably appear just as Microsoft has the embarrassment of making a net loss for the first time in its public history because of the aQuantive writedown. Twitter Transparency Report &gt;&gt; Twitter Blog Here&apos;s the full fat report. Twitter releases data on government requests for user information &gt;&gt; theguardian.com Almost 80% of all requests made to Twitter for information on its users to be released in the course of criminal investigations or other probes are made by the US government. The web is working for American businesses &gt;&gt; Official Google Blog  In fact, in 2011, Google&apos;s search and advertising tools helped provide $80bn of economic activity for 1.8m advertisers, website publishers and nonprofits across the U.S. You can see the state-by-state breakdown on our economic impact website.   This sort of background-hum lobbying occurs when companies think they&apos;re under pressure from other externalities. Compare an example from Microsoft in 2007. What&apos;s Google worried about?

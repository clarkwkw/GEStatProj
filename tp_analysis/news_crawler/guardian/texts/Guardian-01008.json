    "text": "The Science Weekly team are on their annual winter break, but before Alok Jha boarded his private jet and departed for sunnier climes he put together a &quot;Science Weekly revisited&quot; edition of the show. With nearly six years of podcasts all available to download or stream for free, we thought we&apos;d give you a taste of some of our most memorable interviews. We returned to March 2009 when Alok and the team met Olivia Judson, evolutionary biologist and acclaimed science writer. Olivia spoke about her Sense About Science lecture in which she argued that scientists are too risk-averse and need to face the fear of being wrong to do great science. Next, we returned to our March 2010 interview with astrophysicist and author Paul Davies to hear about a new approach to discovering intelligent life forms elsewhere in the universe.  At the Guardian Science Book Club we&apos;re currently reading Davies&apos;s God and the New Physics. Finally we heard from science writer Rebecca Skloot who came into the studio in June 2010 to discuss her book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, the story of a poor African-American woman dying of cancer in 1951 and how her cells sparked a new era in medical science and live on today in a thousand laboratories.

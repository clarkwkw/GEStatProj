Manisha was married off when she was 14, but secretly used contraceptives with the help of her husband's sister. When he found out, he forced her to stop, and she was soon pregnant, with no money to terminate it. She is now 8 months pregnant again.Photograph: Suzanne Lee / Save the Children       Nisha Darlami, 19, carries her one-month-old baby girl, Bushpa, as she sits in her mother's house in Kalyan Village.

    "text": "Visual novels are a uniquely Japanese phenomenon, barely games at all by western standards. Instead of directly guiding characters through environments, you read through a lengthy narrative with only occasional interaction. However, as the recent Virtue&apos;s Last Reward proved to profound effect, there is scope for great stories to be told in this form. Corpse Party, using anime visuals and full Japanese voice acting to craft blood-curdling horror, is further proof of this. The game follows several characters through interwoven chapters, all centred around the cursed Heavenly Host elementary school. Missing students, deaths, psychic trauma and a twisted application of deja vu all factor into the terror that follows. Decisions at key moments coupled with a small degree of exploration and puzzle-solving can change the direction of the story, leading to some genuinely unpleasant fates. While undeniably influenced by films such as Ring or Ju-on, the heightened vulnerability of its youthful cast makes the macabre goings-on seem especially unsettling. How much you&apos;ll enjoy Corpse Party depends largely on your patience. Battle through the text onslaught though and the engaging story and atmospheric music (with some excellent directionality through headphones, adding some pant-wettingly creepy moments) provide a sterling example of Japanese horror.

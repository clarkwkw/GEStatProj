    "text": "On 2 June 1947, Mahatma Gandhi had a meeting with the last Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten. With some trepidation, the Viceroy told him of the arrangements for the partition of the subcontinent which he had just put before the political leaders of India. Partition, at the instance of the British, had been firmly opposed by Gandhi. Much to Lord Mountbatten&apos;s amazement, the meeting took an unusual turn. Producing some used envelopes, Gandhi wrote a note for the Viceroy: &quot;I am sorry I cannot speak; when I took the decision about the Monday silence I did make two exceptions, about speaking to high functionaries on urgent matters or attending upon sick people. But I know you don&apos;t want me to break my silence.&quot; In this act of self-abnegation Gandhi set aside his practical opposition to the plan. These five envelopes are today among the 4,500 boxes that form the Broadlands Archives, which, as well as the Mountbatten archives, include the papers of Lord Palmerston, the 19th century foreign secretary and prime minister, and the diaries of the philanthropist, the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury. After a campaign that saw the University of Southampton raise 2.85m in seven months, the acquisition was completed with an announcement that the government had accepted the Mountbatten papers in lieu of inheritance tax and allocated them to Southampton under the national heritage legislation. Iconic material such as Gandhi&apos;s note gives an immediacy of experience to crucial moments from the past. Archives are the research materials of the future, and universities have built major collections in their libraries for researchers, preserving and placing archival material in the public domain of special benefit for their disciplines. There are some 20 higher education libraries and archives in the UK with substantial collections filling more than 1km of shelving, with some holdings reaching 20km or more. Universities offer an environment which is especially sensitive to the needs of donors and depositors of personal archives. Just as debate is a necessary part of daily life, it is import to have plurality of voices from the past and a suspicion of a record that is purely official. The range of data archives keep helps to define subjects in new ways. Archive collections are also about potential in terms of experience, for those at university, at all levels, and about connections with the community at large. Southampton is typical of many institutions, offering not only opportunities for research, but also for teaching with original materials. The exhibition, University archives are the research materials of the future the latest on the 18th and 19th century country house in Hampshire, uses Broadlands to examine broader questions. Working with history undergraduates has shown us the impact of giving students access to primary materials, rather than mediated sources and edited collections. In group work, special subjects and dissertations, Southampton&apos;s history students face new questions, from the physical scale of an archive, to the analysis of original materials, deciding what was significant, and how information was used. These bring new dimensions to the academic experience of the undergraduate. As a base for extended work, the collections provide a special environment for our postgraduates  the university has a rolling programme of archive-based postgraduate studentships that focus on its collections. For academic staff, there is a particular appeal in having locally major collections linked to research: the Broadlands Archives brought David Brown, biographer of Palmerston, to Southampton. Collections provide important points of contact with wider interests. If physical facilities  reading rooms and exhibition galleries  allow access, they can only reach a small proportion of our potential readership. The construction of virtual reading rooms, for whole collections, with associated catalogues, is a recent feature of Special Collections departments. Southampton&apos;s virtual reading room, under development, now holds its first collection, the archives of the Anglo-Jewish Association: six boxes of papers (out of the 60,000 that are held in the archives at Southampton) have produced 10,000 images. More will follow, the Broadlands Archives among them: the task of presenting collections in this way is important if they are to deliver their potential, but daunting in scale. Building on the links that we have made in the funding campaign, in the region, nationally and overseas, is going to be important for the vitality of the collection. Wider resonances like this help archives to live and breathe.

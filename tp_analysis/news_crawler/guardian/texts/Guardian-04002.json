    "headline": "Android over 50% of smartphone sales as Nokia and RIM feel strain", 
    "text": "Android continued its relentless march on the mobile market in the first quarter of 2012, making up 56% of world smartphone shipments as that sector grew by 44.7% to 144.4m, even while the overall world market for mobile phones shrank by 2% year-on-year to 419m, according to new data from research company Gartner.     Normalised view of smartphone market by platform share, 1Q 2007-1Q 2012. Source: Gartner    A year ago Android phones were 36.4% of the smartphone market, at 36.4m units. But a year later they more than doubled to 81m, leaping nearly 20 points in share in the past year. Of other mobile phone platforms, only Apple managed any significant growth in sales and share, rising to 33.1m units and 22.9%, compared to 16.9% and 16.9m units a year ago when the total smartphone market was just short of 100m.      Smartphone sales growth, 1Q 2007 - 1Q 2012, by platform. Source: Gartner    But for Nokia and RIM, which formerly dominated the sector, the figures brought more unsettling news.  RIM struggles RIM in particular saw handset shipments fall from 13m a year ago for a 13% share to 9.9m, and 6.9%, from January to March. Separate figures released on Tuesday by Kantar WorldPanel ComTech said that RIM&apos;s share of consumer sales in the US in the 12 weeks to mid-April dropped to just 3%, from 9% for the same period a year ago - suggesting that one of its former strongholds has become a significant weakness.  RIM&apos;s strongest markets now are in the UK, Spain, Middle East and India - but the Kantar figures (which do not include sales to business) show RIM&apos;s share of sales falling compared a year before in the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy and Australia. The company&apos;s stock has fallen to a 52-week low, and its new BB10 OS may not appear on devices until late in the year. &quot;RIM desperately needs to deliver winning BB10 products to retain users and stay competitive,&quot; said Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner. &quot;This will be very challenging, because BB10 lacks strong developer support, and a new BB10 device will only be available in the fourth quarter of 2012.&quot; Nokia shifts Nokia too faces a torrid time, with a collapse in sales of its older Symbian smartphone OS not being replaced yet by sales of newer devices running Windows Phone. The first quarter of 2012 marked the first three months in which Nokia&apos;s Lumia was available in the UK, but it did not go on sale in the US until after the first quarter. Symbian sales have dived around the world, according to both Gartner and ComTech: Gartner said total sales fell from 27.6m in the year-ago quarter to 12.4m this year, while ComTech saw its share fall to single digits everywhere but Italy - where it more than halved, from 47.1% to 16.9%. But Windows Phone shipments have barely budged. Though Gartner does not distinguish between the now-deprecated Windows Mobile and Windows Phone, the latter is reckoned to be the overwhelming majority of Microsoft licences - but Gartner puts its figure at just 2.7m this first quarter, compared to 2.6m in the same period in 2011. As the smartphone market is expanding, that amounts to a fall in share. Nokia has not yet however begun to offer its Lumia portfolio in a significant number of countries compared to the number in which it sells Symbian. But Gupta noted that the Finnish company, which once dominated the mobile market, is hobbled by its comparatively small smartphone share: for Samsung they make 44% of total shipments, for Apple 100%, but for Nokia just 16%. Dominic Sunnebo, global consumer insight director for ComTech, warned that the coming months could see seismic changes in the UK phone market. &quot;We are likely to see some big changes in manufacturer shares over the coming months, as we expect to see almost 22 million consumers aged 13+ changing their mobile device in the next year, with almost 80% of these consumers buying a smartphone.&quot; The best news for Nokia is that in the UK, Germany, Italy and France, where the Lumia 800 went on sale last November, Windows Phone is showing fast growth compared to a year ago - though its share is still in the low single digits. UK smartphones: change in store? Presently around 53% of the UK mobile-using population of 60m has a smartphone, but it is unclear whether the remainder presently using featurephones will shift to smartphones more quickly than those who already have - who did so over the course of about five years. Some featurephone users might prove reluctant to change. &quot;The pool of featurephone users left to trade up is beginning to diminish,&quot; said Sunnebo. &quot;This means that smartphone manufacturers need to step up their game and find ways of stealing consumers from their competitors  something that usually proves harder than convincing existing customers to trade up from featurephone to smartphone.&quot; Gartner&apos;s figures also confirmed the world dominance of Samsung, which is reckoned to have shipped more mobiles than any other company, and Apple: together, the two companies took 49.3% of the smartphone business, which itself made up a record 34% of the entire mobile sector, surpassing more than one in three sales for the first time.  But within Android, despite its rapid growth and dominant share, there are tensions, said Gupta, due to the rapid commoditisation of the sector. There, he said, &quot;a strong commoditization trend is at work and most players are finding it hard to break the mould. At the high end, hardware features coupled with applications and services are helping differentiation, but this is restricted to major players with intellectual property assets. However, in the mid to low-end segment, price is increasingly becoming the sole differentiator. This will only worsen with the entry of new players and the dominance of Chinese manufacturers, leading to increased competition, low profitability and scattered market share.&quot; Sunnebo, for ComTech, pointed to HTC&apos;s success with the One X, which became one of the ten best-selling phones for the 12 weeks to the end of April, despite only being on sale for one week. But Sony and LG saw their share of Android sales in the UK dwindle, to 10.4% and 1% - and so to only half that of the overall smartphone market, where Android has 50.1% of sales. Both companies have struggled to convert their featurephone users, said ComTech: in the past year only 11% of Sony featurephone users upgraded to one of its smartphones, while for LG the figure was just 4%. Future challenges Android&apos;s share of the UK market grew from 44.6% in the 12 weeks to mid-April 2011 to 50.1%. Apple&apos;s grew faster, from 18.6% to 30%, and Sunnebo suggested that it could be well-positioned for future challenges: &quot;Rich new content and features are a big driver for consumers looking to trade up. However, convincing users to switch brands requires an emphasis on the user experience  an area in which Apple excels. Consumers have come to expect top-end hardware, and manufacturers are responding with innovative software, good services and exclusive content partnerships.&quot; Some of the ComTech data hints at increased price sensitivity in parts of the Eurozone such as Spain, where Android has hit a 72% share. But its dominance is emphasised by the fact that it is approaching or above 50% share in every country surveyed by the company. China meanwhile is becoming increasingly important: the rollout there of smartphones by a brace of local and regional makers including Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, Yulong and TCL Communication is expected to drive sales there. For Apple, it became its second-largest market, after the US, with more than 5m units shipped from a combination of official and unofficial distributors.",

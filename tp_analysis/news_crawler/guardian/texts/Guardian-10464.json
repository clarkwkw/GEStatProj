    "text": "The death of Lonesome George led the world to mourn the extinction of one of the Galpagos Island&apos;s unique giant tortoise lineages. Less than six months later, scientists reveal he was probably not the last of his kind after all. Oh, the irony. For more than 40 years and the whole of my lifetime, Lonesome George had been in captivity, removed from his native island of Pinta in the north of the archipelago in 1972 and transferred to the Charles Darwin research station on the central island of Santa Cruz. Conservationists (and George?) had hoped to locate a Pinta Island tortoise female  either on his island or perhaps in a zoo. But on 24 June this year, the world&apos;s most celebrated reptilian bachelor finally gave up the tortoise ghost in solitude. I travelled out to the Galpagos to report on the sombre mood after George&apos;s death and had the unsettling experience of seeing him once more, his carapace by then unceremoniously bubble-wrapped and duck-taped in an Electrolux freezer. I also met Gisella Caccone, a geneticist from Yale University, who was in the Galpagos to take part in the first ever tortoise summit to be held in the islands. For years Caccone and her colleagues have been taking blood samples from giant tortoises in the hope that some of them might have a Lonesome George-like signature to their DNA. But just when they&apos;d found some, George had decided it was time to go. His death hit her hard. &quot;He was like a family member,&quot; she told me. &quot;I grieved and I thought of the things I could have done that I did not do. I thought I had more time.&quot; Almost a decade ago, whilst analysing DNA from a sample of 27 tortoises from Wolf Volcano on the nearby island of Isabela, Caccone sensed she was on to something. With ancient DNA from museum-based specimens giving a more robust picture of the genetic makeup of the Pinta species, it became clear that one of these Isabela tortoises was, in fact, a first-generation hybrid of a full-blown Pinta male and an Isabela female. It remains a mystery as to how it got there, but the smart money is on the pirates and whalers who were responsible for collecting hundreds of thousands of giant tortoises and moving them between islands. &quot;Lonesome George is not alone&quot;, the geneticists reported in Current Biology back in 2007. This surprising news triggered the Galpagos national park to mount an 11-day expedition to Isabela the following year. The idea was to survey the Wolf Volcano population more widely, giving as many tortoises as possible a microchip in exchange for a drop of blood. Caccone et al, who accompanied them, came away gleeful, clutching samples from more than 1,600 individuals. These samples have already yielded a considerable surprise. In January this year, another paper in Current Biology showed that some of these tortoises are descended from those that once roamed the southerly island of Floreana, a species thought to have gone extinct in around 1850. Now, in a paper due to be published in Biological Conservation , they have turned the spotlight on Isabela tortoises with Pinta ancestry. They have identified 17 tortoises, four of which look like they are first-generation hybrids, with one or other of their parents being of full Pinta stock. The rest seem to be second-generation hybrids. Interestingly, five of the animals are juveniles, so less than 20-years-old, suggesting there could well be purebred Pinta tortoises still on Isabela. A follow-up expedition is planned for the spring, according to Yale University. They will be on the lookout for unchipped tortoises in the hope of tracking down one of these much-mooted Pinta purebreds. If they can relocate any of the 17 hybrids identified in the forthcoming paper, the Galpagos national park is likely to transport them to Santa Cruz with a view to getting them to reproduce. In a matter of years, it&apos;s now a very real possibility that we will see baby tortoises back on Pinta, each carrying an enhanced smattering of Pinta-like genes. These might seem like extraordinary lengths to go to. After all, Yale&apos;s genetic work also tells us that from a genetic perspective the Pinta tortoise is virtually identical to the Espaola clan. Wouldn&apos;t these make perfectly good stand-ins for Lonesome George&apos;s tenuous lineage? From a purely biological perspective, yes they probably would. But one of Lonesome George&apos;s many legacies is that the Pinta species now packs a considerable symbolic punch. Raising Chelonoidis abingdoni from the dead would be a bold, almost aggressive statement of the Galpagos national park&apos;s intent on habitat restoration and a fitting tribute to Lonesome George into the bargain. It&apos;s a crying shame that the leathery old poster-boy no longer has the option of taking an active part in such a breeding initiative (though given the chance he&apos;d probably have declined). But one thing&apos;s for sure. If this breeding programme gets up and running, Lonesome George will be there in spirit, guiding his relatives every slow step of the way.

    "text": "Azeroth, the sprawling fantasy planet in World Of Warcraft, has certainly had its share of catastrophes over the years. First, it was nearly overrun by the demon Illidan and the Burning Crusade. Next, it had to deal with the threat from Prince Arthas, The Lich King, and his army of the undead. Most recently, the dragon Deathwing returned to the surface of the world, precipitating a global natural disaster that reshaped and ruined much of Azeroth&apos;s landscape. And now, the World Of Warcraft is braced for the addition of a very different type of potentially lethal creature. The panda. To say that hominid pandas  or Pandarens to give them their proper name  have been promoted as the top-level drawcard for WOW&apos;s new expansion pack, Mists Of Pandaria, feels anticlimactic to say the least. In the past, new additions to Azeroth have placed the destruction of the entire world on the table as the overarching narrative.  Since it was first unveiled at BlizzCon 2011, Mists Of Pandaria has received a mixed reception from the WOW faithful. Players are split right down the middle. Half of them are looking forward to the new areas, new quests and new playable Monk class. The other half say that Mists has essentially sounded the death knell for the gaming industry&apos;s most widely played and preternaturally profitable MMO.  To a degree, Blizzard needs to shoulder some of the blame for the latter reaction. Until now, the only Mists information available was that which could be gleaned from the BlizzCon trailer. Fans knew about a new race, a new playable class and a new continent to explore in Azeroth with a visual aesthetic based on the Far East.  The trailer also flashed up the promise of aspects such as &apos;Challenge Mode Dungeons&apos;, &apos;PvE Scenarios&apos; and &apos;Pet Battles&apos;, but the developers haven&apos;t gone to any lengths to explain these features. The only things players know for certain, is that they&apos;ll have the chance to roll new characters  the pandas  who possibly know Kung Fu.  But the sceptics and the naysayers should have more faith. At a recent event at the developer&apos;s headquarters in Irvine, California, Blizzard&apos;s Vice President of Creative Development Chris Metzen fronted a presentation, which revealed astonishing depth of content and provided context for it within the lore of the WOW universe.  The tone of the new expansion pack may be more light-hearted than its predecessors  there&apos;s no end-of-the-world threat to combat here  but it&apos;s as engrossing and compelling as any add-on Blizzard has produced in the past.      The set-up for Mists Of Pandaria sees the Horde and Alliance forces landing on the forgotten shores of that titular continent. In short order, the players learn that Pandaria is at something of a transition; the brutal, dictatorial former rulers of the continent are making a grab for control and an ancient evil has been awakened by the arrival of the two WOW factions.  As the overarching narrative of the expansion pack unfolds, players will be guided through the huge, enchanting map of Pandaria, and will come to learn about the land&apos;s different warring factions and its history. They&apos;ll also join forces with the local population in repelling the malignant forces at work to return Pandaria to its darkest days. The storyline won&apos;t end there. Metzen revealed that at the end of Pandaria&apos;s main quests, Blizzard will be releasing a host of patches that add more plot as the bulk of the Horde and Alliance forces arrive and begin to do battle for control of the land. A new central villain will emerge that&apos;ll provide a focal point for both factions&apos; efforts in the form of Garrosh Hellscream, Warchief of the Horde.  Garrosh&apos;s tactical choices on Pandaria cause consternation within the ranks of the Horde and prompt the Alliance to rally against their age-old foes. The events that transpire also herald the return of the Horde&apos;s former Warchief, Thrall. In World Of Warcraft&apos;s new expansion pack, the main threat to the player and the new continent in Azeroth is, it seems, war itself.  Before the players reach this stage, however, they&apos;ll likely become lost in the huge, sprawling land of Pandaria. The map from WOW&apos;s new expansion pack has grown since its BlizzCon unveiling, from five zones to seven. The starting area for Pandaria is a lush, emerald coloured woodland called the Jade Forest. It&apos;s here that the Horde and Alliance factions rally their forces after crashing onto Pandaria. It&apos;s also, where players will encounter one of the expansion&apos;s new villains in its first dungeon.  The Temple Of The Jade Serpent is a huge, beautiful structure housing an evil, spiritual entity that can manifest itself physically called Sha. The Sha is a dark, emotionally-charged energy that is unique to Pandaria, a boiling, dangerous cauldron of hatred, fear and violence that has remained buried for hundreds of years. The arrival of the Horde and the Alliance has awakened its powers, and their conflict allows it to grow to the point that it threatens to engulf Pandaria.  Players are also introduced to two new factions on Pandaria in this zone: the Hozen and the Jinyu. The former are ape-like hominids who eventually throw their lot in with the Horde and the latter are fish-like amphibians who side with the Alliance. Both are initially hostile to the newcomers on Pandaria and initial stages of the game involve fighting off their attempts to remove the Horde and Alliance factions from Pandaria.      The Hozen and the Jinyu are just two of the new races encountered in Pandaria. As they make their way deeper into the new map, players will run into (amongst others) the Mogu, the brutal former rulers of Pandaria who are trying to take back their kingdom, the Yaungol, a shaggy, warlike cousin to the Turians and the Mantid, a malevolent race of intelligent insects. Of course, the most notable new race is also one of the key attractions of the expansion set: the hominid panda race, the Panderans. The Panderans, as has been mentioned, are the new playable race in Mists Of Pandaria, and they bring with them, the new playable class: the Monk. Blizzard hasn&apos;t revealed if other races can adopt this class  whether it&apos;ll be like the Death Knight from Wrath Of The Lich King, where players can update their class once they&apos;ve reached the requisite level. Pandarians, however, can certainly be rolled as Monks, and the new class brings a new physicality to WOW&apos;s combat system. The Monks combine martial arts abilities with magic in an interesting cocktail of moves that show off some of the game&apos;s new animations. A lot of the Monk abilities are powered by Chi, which is represented on the HUD in a new gauge containing four slots just under the character&apos;s health and magic bars. Different moves cost different amounts of Chi, depending on their effects; a spin-heel kick costs two, for example, where a death-touch instant kill move on a wounded enemy can cost four. Players fill the Chi slots by lading jab attacks.  Monks can also execute forward rolls and flying kicks that send them hurtling around the map; both of these help players evade danger and in truth the flying kick is more useful at this stage as an escape manoeuvre than an attack move.  Blizzard hasn&apos;t been forthcoming about how the Monk&apos;s new moves will be balanced against other classes, but presumably this is something the developer plans to look at before the player beta is released. However, the team did reveal the tree paths players can take with the Monk&apos;s talents which would dictate how they choose to play them; Brewmasters are tanks, Windwalkers are DPS class and Mistweavers are healers. Talent trees have also been slightly streamlined for the new expansion pack. In the past the aim behind talents was that players would apply interesting combinations of talents resulting in a personal stamp on their characters.  In truth, what happened, was that players simply worked out the optimum way to apply talents based on what sort of character they wanted to play. Blizzard says the new talents are more balanced and more about fun. The idea is, changing talents is now fairly easy, so players will be able to rotate options, using their favourite characters in different ways. The new level cap for the expansion has also been increased to 90. And it looks as though players are going to have a pretty interesting ride on their way to levelling up their characters. Once they clear the Jade Forest, the rest of the vast and varied continent of Pandaria will be available to explore and quest in.  Players can head to the sunkissed breadbasket in the Valley of the Four Winds, where they buy their own farm, grow their own crops and sell the fruits of their labours at the central arable market. They can explore the Kasarang Wilds, a huge overgrown rainforest that&apos;s home to the Mogu forces and their lizard people slaves. They can climb up Kun Lai Summit, the largest mountain in the whole of Azeroth, where the wise and ancient elite fighters of Pandaria, the Shado-Pan, reside in their snow-covered monastery.  Players can even, if the mood takes them, head into the Vale Of Eternal Blossoms, the former centre of the Mogu Empire, which has now become the continent&apos;s centre of learning and culture. Here, in the vale&apos;s ornate library surrounded by pink cherry blossom trees, the Lore Masters put on plays that explain the history and culture of Pandaria.      It almost goes without saying that all of these environments look absolutely stunning. Blizzard has always prided itself on the artistic presentation of its worlds and Pandaria is no exception. The continent&apos;s lands vary from snow-capped mountains, to sand-coloured plains to tropical forests and beyond and every inch of its Far Eastern architecture is beautifully constructed and intricately detailed. It all looks so good that it&apos;s hard to believe it&apos;s all running on an engine that&apos;s over eight years old.  On top of all the new quests and zones, Blizzard has loaded Pandaria with new activities for players to grind away at. You can now take part in PvE Scenarios, which work like mini-dungeon levels, allowing participants to queue up for quick adventures that offer sizable equipment drops.  Each scenario is constructed like a quest and features a nasty boss battle at the end. Naturally, Pandaria has its own set of dungeons, but now players can attack them on timed runs, meaning that completing dungeons in the quickest time possible earns them unique items and bragging rights on the leaderboards. There is also more to do with pets in Pandaria. Blizzard has built a Pet Battle system for the game where owners can challenge each other to team battles involving the pets they&apos;ve collected over time. The battles themselves come across like a mash-up of Pokemon with Final Fantasy&apos;s combat system. In a conscious attempt to keep it all fun and light-hearted, Blizzard say players won&apos;t see their opponent&apos;s names during Pet Battles, nor will they be able to taunt them via chat channels. There&apos;s also no way to keep track of how many battles have been won or lost, so there&apos;s no reason to feel bad.  Blizzard hasn&apos;t announced a release date for Pandaria yet, although the team did say that a lot of the content for five of the game&apos;s seven zones is nearly complete. With any luck this means that the player beta shouldn&apos;t be too far off.  To be frank, the beta can&apos;t come soon enough. A lot of WOW players still need convincing that Mists Of Pandaria isn&apos;t the MMO&apos;s &apos;Jump The Shark&apos; moment and that the expansion offers more than just Kung-Fu Pandas. But if they can get over their initial prejudices and take the plunge, it&apos;s more than likely they&apos;ll find Mists Of Pandaria is as strong as any WOW expansion pack that&apos;s preceded it.",

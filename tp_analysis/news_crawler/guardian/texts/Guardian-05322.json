    "text": "The wait is over. Armchair thrill-seekers who haven&apos;t seen an SSX game since their PS2 vanishedintothe loft can finally enjoy it on a high-definition console. Yes, SSX, the groundbreaking snowboarding franchise, has returned to make a whole new generation dizzy with its winning combination of realistic physics and utter impossibility. It&apos;s all here: the usual suspects plus three new characters, each with their signature &quot;ber&quot; and &quot;super-ber&quot; moves, and a killer eclectic soundtrack that mixes itself as you fling yourself down geographically correct mountains, as satellite-mapped by Nasa, no less. There are nine ranges to race, trick and merely survive in the well named Deadly Descents, which will see you try to &apos;board on ice (it&apos;s tricky), race in pitch darkness, or where the way forward is more gorge than piste and requires a wingsuit SSX&apos;s multiplayer action takes place online (and in no other way). Players compete against ghosts of their rivals&apos; best runs and scores, either simultaneously or whenever the mood takes them while amassing medals for everything from going really, really fast to crashing all the time.",

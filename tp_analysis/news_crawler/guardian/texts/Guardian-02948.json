Image: Nick Athanas/Tropical Birding, 13 October 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Canon EOS 7D     Question: These distinctive Peruvian mystery birds are also found in a another, distant, part of the world, which should be surprising considering this species&apos; habits and habitat preferences. Where is that other location? Why is this so surprising? Can you name this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is a flock of grey-headed gulls, Chroicocephalus cirrocephalus, which are the nominate subspecies of this taxon. These small two-year gulls are found along the eastern coast of South America and across much of sub-Saharan Africa [map]. They are gregarious birds, breeding in large colonies in marshes. The female lays two or three eggs in a simple nest that can be on the ground or floating on the water.  When not breeding, these birds often occur in large flocks in estuaries, coastal areas, freshwater or saltwater wetlands as well as beaches, lakes, rivers, and human garbage dumps, feeding on invertebrates and whatever they can scrounge at garbage dumps. The birds are quite noisy and their voices are similar to crows&apos;. Here&apos;s a short video of one individual in Per, indulging in the pleasures of yelling:             [video link]. Interestingly, despite their presence on both sides of the Atlantic ocean these birds are not pelagic, nor do they typically wander far from land. However, there&apos;s always one individual that doesn&apos;t read the rules book, so individuals of this species have popped up in Spain (twice) and in North America (twice, including one individual that appeared in August 2011 on Coney Island).  This is a small two-year gull with a long deep-red bill and legs. Adults in breeding plumage have a distinctive pale-gray hood, a white neck and underparts, a pale grey back and a pale eye. The upperwing is a pale grey with a distinctive white crescent-shaped wedge on leading edge of the outer wing. The upper and underwing have a large black tip with a distinct white mirror on the outermost two primaries. This contrasts with grey underwing, which darkens into the black wingtip. The gray underwings and the white crescent on the upperwings are distinct and easily visible when the bird is in flight. Winter adults replace their grey hood with a smudgy grey ear spot and grey smudgy streaks on the head and neck. In the mystery bird image I showed you, the closest bird is in winter plumage. First year immature birds have a black terminal tail band, more dark areas in the wings, and the bill is paler.  The South American subspecies is slightly larger than the African subspecies and its upperparts are paler grey.  Here&apos;s a look at a flock of the South American subspecies in non-breeding/winter plumage. There&apos;s a few birds in this video that give you a nice glimpse of the white crescent on the upper wing:             [video link]. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

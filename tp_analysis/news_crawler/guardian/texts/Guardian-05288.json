    "text": "This 3D update of Metal Gear&apos;s most testing chapter is oddly timed  only last month, the same game got the high-def treatment for home consoles. Still, being chronologically the first episode in the saga, it&apos;s a fittingintroduction to Nintendo&apos;s new(ish) handheld. Set during the cold war, the story revolves around Naked Snake, who has to rescue a defecting Soviet missile expert from a jungle base. It&apos;s gripping spy-fi, but while the story excels, Snake Eater isn&apos;t without flaws. The lack of twin thumbsticks makes controlling Snake awkward at best, and while the use of 3D is the best seen on the system to date, everything is terribly dark  all but impossible to play away from home. There are some interesting quirks  taking photos with the 3DS&apos;s camera to create your own in-game camouflage, for instance, but it&apos;s simply too fiddly for portable gaming.",

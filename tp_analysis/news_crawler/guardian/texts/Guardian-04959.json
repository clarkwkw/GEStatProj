    "text": "British schools have more computers per pupil than almost every other European country, but our computing lessons are still &quot;highly unsatisfactory&quot;, a group of leading scientists has warned. The Royal Society, one of the country&apos;s most eminent scientific institutions, conducted an 18-month study into the teaching of computing in UK schools. It found that teachers, academics and the computer science industry were in agreement that British schools had &quot;lost their way&quot; in teaching the subject. Schools are failing to expose pupils to the &quot;interest, excitement and creativity that even a modest mastery of the subject offers&quot;, the study argues. The shortcomings of computing classes  also known as Information and Communications Technology (ICT) lessons  have come under intense scrutiny over the last few months. On Wednesday, Michael Gove, the education secretary, announced that the teaching of computer science was to be dramatically overhauled, with the existing programme of study scrapped to make way for new lessons designed by industry and universities. In August, Google&apos;s chairman, Eric Schmidt, delivered a critique of the UK&apos;s education system during a lecture, claiming that the country had failed to capitalise on its record of innovation in science and engineering. This week, the Guardian launched a digital literacy campaign to improve IT and computer science teaching in schools and universities. The Royal Society&apos;s study found that primary schools in England and Wales had 1.9 or 1.8 students for each computer  the best in Europe. Both countries were also ahead of almost all European countries in the number of secondary school students for each computer. However, the scientists argue that such heavy investment should not be assumed to have improved the teaching of computer science. &quot;The current delivery of computing education in many UK schools is highly unsatisfactory,&quot; the scientists, who include Nobel prize winner Paul Nurse, argue. &quot;We appear to have succeeded in making many people comfortable with using the technology that we find around us, but this seems to have been at the expense of failing to provide a deeper understanding of the rigorous academic subject of computer science.&quot; The study argues that by the time pupils leave compulsory education, it is as important for them to have a basic grasp of computer science as it is for them to be able to read and write. The scientists recommend that primary school teachers use easily available software to help their pupils learn how to code, while secondary schools should offer a recognised computer science qualification to all 14-year-olds. The study  Shut Down or Restart? The Way Forward for Computing in UK Schools  urges industry experts and exam boards to come up with more rigorous computing qualifications for pupils aged 16 and over. Few universities appear to hold computing A-level in high esteem and many students end up dropping out of computer science degree courses because they have too little basic knowledge, the report argues. Just one in eight elite universities list a computing A-level as a requirement for computer science degrees. Computer science suffers from a dire shortage of teachers with &quot;sufficient&quot; subject knowledge and the government could remedy this by awarding bursaries to suitable candidates, the study found. Just 33% of ICT teachers are qualified in the subject, according to government data from 2010. Gove&apos;s plans to overhaul the ICT curriculum will go out to consultation next week. Ministers are keen to see universities and businesses creating a new computer science GCSE and developing a curriculum that encourages schools to make use of computer science content on the web. IBM and Microsoft are already working on a pilot GCSE curriculum.",

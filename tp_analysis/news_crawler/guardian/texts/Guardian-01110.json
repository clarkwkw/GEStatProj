    "text": "That Higher Education Bill is to be shelved indefinitely is the final proof that pragmatism trumps ideology when it comes to creating a market in HE. The legislation would have made it easier for private colleges to set up new universities in England. It would have also allowed profit making organisations such as the global education giant Pearson, to award degrees. Now all that is on hold, possibly until after a general election. There is speculation that politicians, in particular Liberal Democrats, had taken fright at the role for-profit universities in the US played inincreasing student debt default, which is at the highest level for a decade. It is a decade in which for-profit colleges are accused of targeting recruitment at poor, often ethnic minority groups. Many have run up tens of thousands of dollars in loans and then found themselves unemployed or on low wages. Professor of political economy at Evergreen State University, Alan Nasser, told Forbes magazine that enrolments at for-profit colleges increased by 225% in the past 10 years. The Pew Research Institute says that although students at US for-profits make up only 9% of all college students they receive 25% of Federal Pell grants and loans and are responsible for 44% of defaults. Forbes reports that outstanding student loans are approaching a trillion dollars. It&apos;s a situation guaranteed to make any politician in the UK uncomfortable. The CEO of Guild HE, Andy Westwood, says that the decision is overwhelmingly political. As a former special adviser to the John Denham, when he was Universities Secretary of State, he ought to know. Westwood points out in his blog that legislation isn&apos;t needed for most of the HE reforms. &quot;As we have seen with welfare, there is never a guarantee of a safe passage, particularly with unpredictable and still wounded Lib Dems. Worse, a bill offers the opportunity for every critic in parliament, the media and the sector, to dig up the whole reform story again and to scrutinise every detailed change going back to Browne. And all this for relatively few further changes to higher education&quot;. Meanwhile the UK&apos;s existing small coterie of private universities and their owners must be rubbing their hands with glee. Newcomers will now have to take the long way round if they want to win degree awarding powers which makes the handful of for profits in the UK, which already can award degrees, very special indeed. BPP, owned by the US giant Apollo was recently forced to write down it&apos;s value, perhaps that&apos;s a trend that will now reverse. The owners of the London College of Law, a charity, must be feeling very lucky indeed. According to magazine Education Investor, sealed bids are invited for the sale of the college next week. It reports LCL&apos;s value at 140m to 150m pounds and names Pearson as one of the companies leading the pack seeking to buy. The shelving of the bill is another step in a steady retreat by the Cameron government from market ideology in HE. Already, David Willetts&apos;s hopes of creating a system in which money follows the students are being severely restricted by the Treasury. His white paper promised that every year there would be a gradual lowering of the threshold for the unrestricted recruitment of students. At the moment universities can recruit as many students as they like who achieve two As and a B at A level. But is unlikely to extend beyond BBB students because it is judged too expensive. If David Willetts is unable to create diversity by expanding private provision then there was always the hope that FE colleges would be allowed to expand into HE and snap at the universities&apos; heels. In the event, the expansion of FE provision of higher education will be very small, probably only 3 to 5% according to the Association of Colleges. Hardly a revolution. Vive le Roi.

    "text": "After reading the letters page on tuition fees (15 August), I had to employ all the anger management techniques I teach my clients. I may have failed maths, but some numbers even I can crunch. After accommodation fees, my son will have the princely sum of 37.50 to live on a week from the maximum grant. This will have to include unavoidable travel costs in London from digs to uni, food, insurances, books and equipment. If he wants the odd pint, then this will mean a diet of porridge. And of course his tuition fees are 9,000. Who fell for the story that only a handful of universities would charge this? Get a job (easy peasy, of course) is the first advice. But his parents will have to support him in the end. Heaven knows what the kids who do not have this possibility will do. So for them, surviving is the first challenge. Michael Meadowcroft&apos;s comments on what happens after they have survived at university left me incensed. Where on god&apos;s earth does this confidence come from about easy terms to repay the debt? History teaches us that governments tend to be a little forgetful about deals and promises. But if my son doesn&apos;t go to university, what is at home for him? His peers are unemployed, on their gazillionth training programme. So we will help sustain him to fly the nest, although my suspicion is that he will have to come back at some stage to aid the &quot;survival&quot; process. Meanwhile, supporting two kids at university and as part of the &quot;piggy in the middle class&quot;, I am used to being squeezed until the pips hurt. My heart can only go out to those who have nothing to be squeezed in the first place.Suzanne McCallLuton, Bedfordshire",

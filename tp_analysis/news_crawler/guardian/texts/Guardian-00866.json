    "text": "In a live chat we ran last year about HE in FE, a theme emerged from the discussion; students from low income families are risk averse and ill-informed about the costs of higher education, and as such, are likely to decide that a degree that could cost as much as 9,000 a year is not for them.  Going some way to addressing this problem, the Key Information Sets (KIS) were developed; comparable and standardised information about undergraduate courses, that cover information students themselves have deemed useful.  But many commentators feel that, while valuable, KIS don&apos;t go far enough. Wes Streeting, chief executive of the Helena Kennedy Foundation, said: &quot;Information isn&apos;t enough - advice and guidance is what counts.&quot; And HE consultant, Johnny Rich, explains why: &quot;People talk about &apos;IAG&apos;  information, advice and guidance. The distinction between the three is interesting and important. Information, I would argue, is facts  data and statistics, indisputable details. Advice, meanwhile, happens whenever an opinion creeps into the delivery of information. And if it&apos;s well-informed opinion, it&apos;s expert advice. However advice doesn&apos;t relate personally to the individual getting it. That would be when it becomes guidance  where information and advice is bent to the individual circumstances of the person who needs it. Guidance is a skilled practice, best done by professionals who take the lives and futures of people into their charge and, if they do their job well, set them on a brighter path.&quot; It is this need for &apos;experts&apos; or qualified professionals that makes the delivery of IAG by universities an interesting challenge for our times: government funding has been cut to programmes such as Connexions and Aimhigher while careers services have an ever-widening remit and not always the resources or recognition to deliver additional services. These challenges have however led to some innovation including a new web tool, UniQs, developed through a collaboration between The 1994 Group, Push and JISC. Talking about UniQs, Janice Kay, chair of the 1994 Group Student Experience Policy Group, explained that the tool intended to take information students want, to the places where they are online: social networks, blogs and professional services they use.  This Friday 20 January, we bring together HE professionals involved with the creation and dissemination of IAG, to explore the ways in which all universities can better provide all groups of prospective students with what they need to make informed decisions.  Join us at 12pm GMT to share your experiences, best practice examples or ask questions about where to start. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

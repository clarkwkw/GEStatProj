    "text": "For Kenyan gospel rapper Eko Dydda, words are more than mere signifiers. They can be life-or-death markers of who you are. &quot;I almost got killed by people of my tribe because I couldn&apos;t speak the language. I can&apos;t speak vernacular. I grew up in the streets. I speak Sheng,&quot; he said, referring to the ever-evolving slang blend of Kiswahili and English, Kenya&apos;s two official languages. The incident happened during post-election violence in Nairobi&apos;s Mathare slum in 2007, and it illustrates the importance of language as an identifier in Kenya, home to more than 40 tribes and over 60 tribal languages. For Eko Dydda, Sheng&apos;s mongrel-like quality has always been appealing, for aesthetic and political reasons, but on that one day five years ago, this favouritism almost cost him his life. He was saved by a stranger. &quot;He can&apos;t speak vernacular. He&apos;s a born-town,&quot; the man explained, using slang to describe a Kenyan who has never lived outside the city. The gang left him alone. As Kenya gears up for its first presidential election since the disputed 2007 poll, the question of language and national identity is again being debated. In the cosmopolitan capital Nairobi, where upmarket malls stock shoes that cost more than a month&apos;s wages for people in nearby slums, English, Kiswahili and Sheng dominate, often merging seamlessly in the mouths of the younger generation. Linguists say the balance of power between these three, and some of the more widely spoken vernacular or tribal languages such as Kikuyu or Luo, is constantly evolving, with a new voice also rising  Kenyan English, a version of the standard English bequeathed by British colonial rulers. Standard English is still seen as the must-have language for upwardly mobile Kenyans. It is the language of instruction in schools, where Kiswahili is taught as a subject. Yet outside Nairobi&apos;s malls, Kiswahili and Sheng, itself a 1970s child of the slums, dominate the city&apos;s low-income neighbourhoods. Further away, in the arid north of the Rift Valley, tribal languages come to the fore, such as Kikuyu, Luo, Maa, Turkana or Kipsigis. Kiswahili, a Bantu language that has borrowed heavily from Arabic and is widely spoken in east Africa, was given the status of an official language in Kenya&apos;s 2010 constitution, but Professor Kimani Njogu, a respected linguist and Kiswahili scholar, says English is favoured, at least among a certain class. &quot;The two languages are competing for space, and to the extent that English is still privileged in terms of status, in terms of prestige, in terms of job placement ... it is way ahead of Kiswahili,&quot; he said. However, Kiswahili remains the national language, and this confers a special status. &quot;It&apos;s the language of national consciousness  in terms of building nationhood across ethnic groups in a very fragile state, it is important it is made available across the country,&quot; Njogu said, mindful of early signs of rising tensions ahead of next March&apos;s election in a country where people tend to vote on tribal lines. Although English appears to be thriving, its nature is changing. English schoolbooks are now written by Kenyans and the language is taught by Kenyans. In its daily use, it is being shaped into a unique form, dubbed Kenyan English. Njogu gives some examples, highlighting the common use of double pronouns, such as &quot;me myself, I don&apos;t know,&quot; or &quot;we, ourselves&quot;. He does not see Kenyan English taking over from standard English but admits this will depend to a degree on how committed teachers are in upholding the more academic, written form. Sheng is also growing up, slouching from the streets into the classroom, and into mainstream media: a multimedia production Shujaaz.FM (&quot;heroes&quot; in Sheng) won an International Digital Emmy Award in April. Njogu said research done by a graduate student he worked with found that Sheng, which he describes as a &quot;youth communicative code&quot;, is finding its way into English compositions in high schools. &quot;What will happen eventually is ... it will no longer be a youth-driven slang. I think it will be an urban population-driven slang so that older people who were initially excluded from Sheng will be speakers of Sheng,&quot; he said. &quot;The salience of standard English and the salience of Kiswahili will not be as central because of Sheng. It&apos;s attractive, it allows for greater flexibility, if you get stuck with terminology you are able to borrow from anywhere and just insert,&quot; he said. In Sheng, a person might greet another by saying &quot;Sasa?&quot; (How are you now?), to which the reply might be &quot;Fit sana&quot;, where &quot;fit&quot; comes from English and &quot;sana&quot; means &quot;very&quot; in Swahili. Some Kenyan officials have warned that Sheng&apos;s popularity is affecting the quality of Kiswahili and English among schoolchildren. In 2011, then minister of education Sam Ongeri blamed Sheng for students&apos; poor performances in final exams in the two official languages. Analysts say the real problem more likely lies in the quality of education being offered at state schools. John Mugo is the country co-ordinator for Uwezo Kenya (&quot;capability&quot; in Kiswahili), which produces annual literacy and numeracy studies among children aged between six and 16. Only around 30% of children in Grade 3 (aged around eight to nine years) can do Grade 2 work, Mugo says. The reasons are varied and include teacher and pupil absenteeism, a lack of materials, lack of parent participation, and the national focus on performance in the final primary school exam, which leaves lower grades stuck with the least motivated, least talented teachers. Within that context, however, English is privileged because, Mugo says, teachers and parents believe it is essential for success. &quot;The attitude of parents and teachers is that whoever speaks English earliest will pass [the exams] after eight years.&quot; Njogu says the linguistic changes must be placed in a global context, and that no language need necessarily lose out. &quot;We are really talking about Englishes, and these Englishes are predominantly English as spoken in Britain but with twists and turns that are localised,&quot; he said. &quot;I have always taken the view that the way to do this is not to discourage Kenyan English but to teach English well and to teach Kiswahili well but to take into consideration the emergence of all these varieties, and not to be prescriptive in an insulting way but to appreciate that human beings are creative beings and they will play around with language.&quot;  This article was amended on 19 October 2012 because the original incorrectly said &apos;In Sheng, a person might greet another by saying &quot;Sasa now?&quot;&apos;.",

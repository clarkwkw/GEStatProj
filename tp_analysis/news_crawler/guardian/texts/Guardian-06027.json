    "text": "David Cameron&apos;s drive to modernise the Tory party was again called into question by aid groups last night, after it emerged a commitment to enshrine increases in aid spending in law have been postponed by two years to 2015. Documents seen by the Observer show that the plan to commit Britain to spend 0.7% of its national income on international aid  originally to be passed into law by 2013 under the terms of the coalition agreement  has been shunted back to May 2015. The Tories&apos; determination to pass the law was touted before the 2010 election as a key part of David Cameron&apos;s modernisation agenda. Last month, when the legislation was omitted from the Queen&apos;s Speech, the Department for International Development insisted this was merely because of a lack of parliamentary time and that it would find a slot at the first opportunity. But a DfID document entitled &quot;implementation update&quot;, dated from last month, says the plan has now been carried forward into a &quot;refreshed business plan&quot; with a &quot;revised end date of March 2015&quot;. Labour now plans to put the government on the spot by offering cross-party co-operation to get the bill through parliament. The Labour MP Mark Hendrick has written to international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, offering to use time allotted for a private member&apos;s bill to advance the government&apos;s bill. Labour&apos;s shadow development secretary Ivan Lewis said the government&apos;s attitude was &quot;extraordinary&quot;, adding that there was now not a &quot;cat in hell&apos;s chance&quot; of a bill being taken forward by the coalition alone. Calling on the coalition MPs to back the Hendrick bill, Lewis said: &quot;I am particularly pleased that Mark Hendrick&apos;s bill will not only commit us to the 0.7% of national income but seek to toughen the remit of the commission on the effectiveness of aid.&quot; Tory MPs have been lobbying Cameron and the Chancellor, George Osborne, to drop the commitment on aid spending and scarce resources. The Global Campaign for Education, which backs plans to boost UK funding to education across the world, said the stalling showed a &quot;worrying lack of urgency on behalf of government&quot;. A DfID spokesman said it was merely &quot;an administrative change&quot; and that legislation would still be introduced &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.",

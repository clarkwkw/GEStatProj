    "text": "     In my role as a professional sceptic, I jumped at the chance to see a preview of Red Lights, the new film starring Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver that goes on general release in the UK on Friday. De Niro plays Simon Silver, a blind psychic who has resurfaced after many years in obscurity following a period of celebrity some three decades earlier, which ended with the mysterious death of his most vocal critic. Weaver plays a psychologist, Margaret Matheson, who long ago moved from scepticism to cynicism about the paranormal, having encountered nothing but fakery throughout her many years of investigation. Her loyal assistant, physicist Tom Buckley, is played by Cillian Murphy, looking for all the world like Professor Brian Cox&apos;s younger brother. Although much psychic fraud is exposed, the viewer is never sure  until the final reel  whether everything is faked or not. But don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not about to give the ending away. Much of the inspiration for the film is taken from real life. A psychic who began his career by &quot;psychically&quot; bending spoons but then disappeared into obscurity, only to re-emerge decades later  remind you of anyone? Another psychic in the film, Leonardo Palladino, uses information fed to him via a hidden earpiece to convince the audience at his show that he is obtaining personal details psychically. Matheson and Buckley expose him by tuning into the radio frequency of his accomplice&apos;s transmitter, leading to his arrest and imprisonment. There can be no doubt that this scene is inspired by the notorious Reverend Peter Popoff, whose identical scam was exposed in 1986 by James Randi using just such a method. Take a look at this YouTube clip of Popoff in action. You can hear Popoff&apos;s wife say, &quot;Hello Petey, can you hear me? If you can&apos;t, you&apos;re in trouble&quot;, a line which the film cheekily includes almost verbatim. (I wrote about this episode in a previous column when similar allegations were made about British psychic Sally Morgan.) In the film, the fake psychic ends up in jail. Although Popoff went bankrupt, he never went to jail, and now he&apos;s back earning millions of dollars a year by, among other things, selling &quot;blessed water&quot; to his sick and desperate flock. Viewers with some knowledge of paranormal research will enjoy trying to figure out the techniques used by the fake psychics in Red Lights before the main characters reveal them. I did wonder if the film did a disservice to parapsychologists by implying that they are all totally incompetent, like the bumbling Professor Shackleton, played by Toby Jones. Any parapsychologist worth their salt would not have been fooled by the techniques used by the fake psychics in this film. Having said that, it&apos;s true that when the field was in its infancy parapsychologists were fooled in very similar ways to those portrayed. For example, in some early investigations of telepathy, the symbol on a card that was to be telepathically transmitted could be seen by the &quot;receiver&quot; through the back of the card. And in 1979, James Randi had two young conjurors turn up at the newly established McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research at Washington University claiming to have psychic powers. They were tested for four years by the laboratory staff and appeared to be able to perform the standard repertoire of psychic feats, including psychokinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. The McDonnell researchers described them as &quot;gifted psychic subjects&quot;. How did they achieve these amazing effects? Easy  they cheated, using simple conjuring tricks. Randi was accused by parapsychologists of behaving unethically, but what other means could have been employed to demonstrate that scientists with no knowledge of conjuring techniques could be easily fooled? There are lots of references in the film that will only be picked up by those in the know. It seems likely that the name Shackleton is a nod towards Basil Shackleton, one of the star subjects of the infamous Soal-Goldney studies carried out in the 1940s. For over four decades, these studies were presented as irrefutable proof of the existence of telepathy  until it was finally established beyond all reasonable doubt that Soal had faked his data. The name of the fake psychic Leonardo Palladino is clearly a reference to the notorious Eusapia Palladino, a very clever Italian medium back in the Victorian heyday of sances. Eusapia, a middle-aged woman of peasant stock, was often caught cheating and would openly warn those who wished to investigate her alleged abilities that she would cheat if they allowed her to do so. Despite this, many of the learned gentlemen who investigated her claims were convinced that some of the phenomena she produced defied any conventional explanation. The underlying assumption here is clear  no Italian peasant could possibly outwit these eminent scholars, could they? Therefore the only options left were either that they would catch her cheating (as they often did) or else the phenomena were genuinely paranormal. With hindsight, that assumption should perhaps be questioned. There are a few aspects of the film that just don&apos;t ring true at all but these can be forgiven in the interests of plot development. The idea that parapsychological research attracts generous funding is certain to bring a wry smile to the faces of most parapsychologists. The notion that &quot;publishing results&quot; is something that an individual scientist has total control over and that these results are literally &quot;signed off&quot; at a precise point in time, at which point they are released upon the world, is nonsense. Have these people not heard of peer review? And how slow it can be? And honestly, throwing the leader of a research team against the wall and threatening him with physical violence is not the right way to get yourself signed up for a project. A lot of the lines that Margaret Matheson comes out with, I could imagine coming out with myself (albeit with a less cynical tone). But there was one thing she said that I really could not agree with. At one point, she expresses profound regret at having doubted, albeit briefly, her belief that paranormal forces do not exist. Someone should remind her that doubt is at the very heart of science and proper scepticism. It&apos;s good to question your own beliefs. It is always possible, however unlikely, that new evidence will be produced that proves your current beliefs wrong. Did I enjoy the film? Any film that mentions Occam&apos;s razor can&apos;t be all bad! Seriously, although the film is flawed in some ways, it was original and fun and there were a couple of plot twists that I cannot claim to have seen coming. I would definitely say this is a film worth seeing. In addition to pure entertainment value, it serves the useful purpose of making people more aware of some of the techniques used by fake psychics (although obviously there are dozens more) and thus, I hope, less likely to fall victim to such scams. But you&apos;ll have to make your own minds up about that ending  Chris French is a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he heads the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit.

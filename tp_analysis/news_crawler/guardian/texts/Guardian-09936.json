    "text": "As I rounded one of the cliffs running inland from the east coast at Loch Fleet I realised that I was being watched. It is always an uncanny feeling and it took me a while before I could see the reason. It turned out to be a large wild goat, a black billy, staring at me. Most mammals, such as deer, look at us with curiosity or as a threat, but I have never found this with goats. They look at us with their dark, narrow pupils, suggesting that they know exactly what is going on. The goat was black, which is by far myfavourite colour for them. I could seethat it was an old billy as the horns are an immediate giveaway. Unlike deer,the horns are not shed but they grow larger each year; the growth rings,wider at the base than farther out,can give an observer a good idea of age. This billy was eight or nine years old. It stood there holding its ground and I wondered why it was not off chasing the nannies as this is the ruttingseason for them. An old legend says that if the goats inthe Morvich area died out, then the sea would break through the causeway and flood back up to Morvich, where itused to be before the road was built 200 years ago. Perhaps, then, this is why the goats are being given more protection. Local people were upset when a kid was killedon the road by a vehicle, and so they have asked the council if it will erect a sign warning drivers of goats on the road. There are signs warning drivers of otters on the causeway and deer along the side roads, but I am wondering if a goat sign is a new one forthe Highlands or even the UK? I haveseen many road signs, including badgers, but never a goat sign.",

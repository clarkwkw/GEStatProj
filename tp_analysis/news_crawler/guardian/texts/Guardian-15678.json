    "text": "Persona 4 Arena&apos;s brand of 2D fighting is, at first glance, a far cry from its brilliant RPG forebear. Once players spend time with this intricately balanced and beautifully animated beat-&apos;em-up though, they will discover it is every bit as deep and involving as its predecessor. Arena sees lead Yu Narukami drawn into another mystery in the parallel Midnight Channel world. This time, it involves being forced to fight his friends while finding out exactly why. The battle system is remarkably complex, demanding mastery of blocks, attack breaks, counters and more, plus awareness of power and health gauges. While far from entry-level, Arena will appeal greatly to fans of the original Persona 4 and lovers of top-tier Japanese fighting games.",

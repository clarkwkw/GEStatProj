    "headline": "Archive 7 May 1912: How to deal with destructive weevils", 
    "text": "The beetle which was found on vines at Garstang is a very destructive weevil, known as the black vine weevil, Otiorrhynchus. The grubs or larvae attack the roots of the plant, and the perfect beetle feeds on the shoots and leaves. The chief remedy suggested in Miss Ormerod&apos;s invaluable manual is to catch your beetle, and, having caught it, destroy it. Boiling water is perhaps the most merciful and most effective method for any insects. The best way to catch it is to look for it when it is at work at night, for most weevils are nocturnal in habit. Before dark spread white cloth beneath the infected vines, or other plants, and after dark go with a strong light and shake the branches over the sheet. Many of the weevils drop as soon as they see a light and others are easily shaken off; they can be seen on the cloth and quickly gathered up. Weevils are slow in movement and do not fly, but if they fall on soil or other dark-coloured surface they are not easy to see.",

Click here to view Featuring 24 caricatured F1 drivers shooting each other with various shiny weaponised bubbles, F1 Race Stars uses the same physics engine as developer Codemasters&apos; Formula 1 games. That means its go karts handle with a poise and precision absent from LittleBigPlanet Karting and its ilk, giving races a competitive edge where your chances of winning escalate significantly with practice. The upshot is close, hard-fought races on a relatively small roster of long, exquisitely designed tracks and the usual plethora of shortcuts and power-ups.

    "text": "If you open and edit Microsoft Word documents from a USB memory stick, does this leave a &quot;footprint&quot; or any other trace of the files on the computer?JohnYes, I would expect the files to leave obvious traces, though I would not expect to be able to find the contents of the documents easily if at all. For example, the names of recently-used files should be listed in the Start menu under Documents, with older ones under My Documents. They will almost certainly be visible in Word&apos;s list of Recent Documents, and probably in Windows Explorer&apos;s history. Unusual file names could well attract attention. Word also keeps temporary copies of documents in hidden recovery files start with a tilde. Word usually opens these in the same directory as your original file, but sometimes bits of text end up in files with names like ~WRL0001.tmp or in the Temp directory. I guess that might happen if Word crashed or your USB stick didn&apos;t have enough space. Finally, parts of any Windows file may be stored in the Windows swap file (pagefile.sys) or the file used to hibernate the PC (hiberfil.sys), though it could be hard to extract any details.  You can minimise the problem by making sure that Word&apos;s auto-save function is turned off, and by running CCleaner to clear out temporary files and histories. In fact, there&apos;s a version of CCleaner that runs from a thumbdrive, so that people can remove traces of their files when using PCs in cybercafes and libraries. One alternative would be to run your own Chrome or Firefox browser from the USB memory stick, perhaps using PortableApps, and edit Word files using the free online Microsoft Office apps accessed via Hotmail or SkyDrive. These are not fully featured but at least they don&apos;t mess up Word documents like Google Docs. Zoho Docs might also be worth a look. It depends on your documents. Simple text files are no problem, but multi-column Word documents with special heading fonts, embedded images, equations, footnotes etc are hard to handle. CD stuck in drive I have an Acer laptop running Windows Vista. On trying to eject a CD there was no response  except for a helpful (?) message saying &quot;there is a problem ejecting a disc from drive E&quot;.Stan Lawrence Is there a tiny hole just under the drawer, probably on the left? If so, poking that with the end of a paperclip should open thedrive. If not, (1) try ejecting the CD from the My Computer screen; (2) reboot your PC: the drawer should open before the PC starts; (3) try updating or renewing the driver; (4) put the laptop down on a flat table with a gentle bang. This is good old fashioned &quot;percussive maintenance&quot;. If all else fails, you may have to unscrew the bottom plate and extract the drive. [In this case, the paperclip worked.] Skipping CDs Around 2003, I transferred some private recordings made on DAT and reel-to-reel tapes to CD-R discs. Recently, skipping has appeared towards the end of tracks during playback on my Philips CD player and on the computer&apos;s CD player. Have you any suggestions? Derek Roughton The CD Repair FAQ (list of frequently asked questions) has a good section on skipping, and describes four basic types. The simplest alternative would be to make new CDs from the files, if they are still on your hard drive or on a backup. If you didn&apos;t keep the originals, you can try using the free Exact Audio Copy software to copy the skipping discs. EAC is slow because it reads disc sectors multiple times and compares the errors; in the worst case, it can read something 82 times. However, if it&apos;s possible to read a CD, then EAC will usually do it. You may also find another recent answer useful: CD, DVD or SD: what&apos;s best for backups? Auto-updates won&apos;t turn on My computer is running Windows XP with Norton Anti-Virus. I became aware recently when checking the Security Centre that neither the firewall nor automatic updates were on. I was able to turn on the firewall, but when I tried to turn on the automatic updates, I got the following error number: Ox80070424. Is there an easy way to solve this? Mary Hagger Microsoft&apos;s support site has a lot of entries for error 0x80070424, but the gist of the problem is that Windows Update doesn&apos;t have the right entries in the Registry. However, it could also be a malware infection, so the first thing to do is to run Microsoft&apos;s free Safety Scanner (msert.exe). If it finds anything and fixes it, you should restart your PC and run Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Free from your desktop, selecting the Quick Scan option. MBAM is more thorough than Safety Scanner, and the aim is to catch anything that Norton might have missed. Next, go to the Microsoft Support page: How do I reset Windows Update components? This page should pop up a FixIt window offering to &quot;Automatically diagnose and fix common problems with Windows Update&quot;, so click the &quot;Run Now&quot; button and do that. The problem may be that a particular file, wuaueng.dll, has not been registered correctly, so if Microsoft&apos;s fix doesn&apos;t work, try registering that file manually as described in Microsoft Answers .",

    "text": "Set in a gorgeous, cel-shaded world filled with striking characters, Gravity Rush serves as much as a showcase for the PS Vita&apos;s capabilities as it does for progressive game design. In the role of an amnesiac called Kat, you&apos;ll move gravity around, leaping from ground to walls to ceiling, with the orientation of the world shifting with you. Combat is generally a hack&apos;n&apos;slash affair, with power-up orbs collected in the wake of fallen enemies. However, it&apos;s snappy and quick, and as you begin to incorporate gravity-shifting techniques into your fighting repertoire, it becomes all the richer and more interesting. Its plot may be mind-bending  protect people from a gravity storm and the monsters it brings  and it may take a while to become accustomed to the shifting orientation, but nothing else on the Vita so perfectly realises the potential of theconsole. A stunning achievement, and a must-own game.",

    "text": "Your report (Michael Gove faces rebellion over no-curves schools plan, 31 December) says a Salford University study found that &quot;well-designed classrooms could improve pupil performance by 25%&quot;, and then gives the architect Richard Rogers space to advance Mossbourne academy, designed by his practice, as &quot;a striking piece of evidence: high in the league tables and with staff and pupils commenting enthusiastically about the impact of the school&apos;s careful design. We proved it is possible to produce a well-designed school collaboratively with the senior teaching staff which adheres to a tight budget. Gove is making it unnecessarily difficult to design good schools.&quot; The Salford study must be set alongside the statement by Professor Dylan Wiliam, deputy director of the Institute of Education, in Building Design in April 2010 that &quot;architects don&apos;t understand schools&quot;, and his recommendation of copying hotel chains, which rely on a small number of design templates. He wrote: &quot;It&apos;s wrong to be reinventing the wheel with every school. We are spending a huge amount of money allowing each school to articulate its identity.&quot; Mossbourne Academy is a fine building, but it cost 3,000/sq m to build, compared with the Learning and Skills Council&apos;s benchmark of 1,500/sq m for what it called &quot;world-class buildings&quot;, and a prefab supplier&apos;s offer of 600/sq m. In February, its former head, Michael Wilshaw, wrote in the Guardian: &quot;Mossbourne Academy  now achieves results much better than the national average and sends pupils to Oxbridge, not because of a bright new building, but because of good systems and structures, good teaching, and staff who work hard and make no excuses for failure.&quot; Even if fancy one-off buildings did improve pupil performance, which seems doubtful, Rogers should get real: we haven&apos;t the money for 3,000/sq m schools.Maritz VandenbergAuthor, An Inclusive Environment ",

    "text": "   Eco Rocking Chair By Novague (Prague)'This ecofriendly rocking chair was designed to connect relaxation with producing energy. A kinetic mechanism akin to a steam engine can be found underneath the seat. It works with a sliding lever that pulls a flywheel disc while the chair rocks. The chair can supply enough energy to power an LED lamp or charge consumer electronics. The principle aim of this concept was to provoke a discussion about how to achieve energetic self-sufficiency in the future. It demonstrates a way of saving up and using energy we produce for common day-to-day activities' Photograph: PR       Fresh Paper by Fenugreen (United States) 'Around 25% of the world's food supply is lost to spoilage. Berries turning to mouldy mush, beautiful greens transforming into brown slimy leaves; mushroom sprouting new forms of fuzzy life within their gills ... This five-inch square paper is comprised of edible organic botanical extracts, and is simply placed into refrigerator drawers, cartons, bags and containers with produce. With no zeolite, sodium permanganate, charcoal, or plastic, a sheet extends produce life by two to four times. The simple magic happens thanks to a secret mix of herbs - similar to those used for medicinal purposes - that inhibit bacterial and fungal growth, as well as degradative enzymes. Sheets can be used and reused over the course of two or three weeks and then composted' Photograph: PR       Recycled Skateboard Bench, by Deck Stool (US) 'These benches are carefully designed and crafted by the designer at Deck Stool. A 60-inch bench is created from 100% reclaimed and recycled broken skateboards. Like the deck stool, the legs of the deck bench are attached to the long, popsicle-shaped seat using skateboard trucks. Two steel support beams run throughout the length of the bench which enables the bench to withstand the weight of three people. Due to the variable nature of recycled skateboard decks, every bench is unique and will feature a one-of-a-kind combination of art, scrapes, colours and graffiti. Despite this fact, we have engineered our production process to insure all deck benches meet the specifications detailed above and that all bench components are interchangeable' Photograph: PR       ROK Espresso Maker by ROK Kitchen Tools (London) 'The ROK espresso maker is hand-powered so you are able to control how much coffee oils are released through the pressure you apply. It uses no electricity so its environmentally friendly too. By using hand-powered pressure, coffee making becomes a more involving pleasure. As you become more experienced you can fine-tune how you use the ROK espresso maker to produce espressos to your personal taste' Photograph: PR       Water Carafe by Arian Brekveld   'The Royal VKBs Water Carafe is self-cooling, chilling water even in the sun. The silicone base prevents the carafe from scratching table surfaces also. Royal VKB develops extraordinary and functional products in cooperation with outstanding Dutch designers. They approach the modern international consumer with an open mind for smart products' Photograph: PR       Recycled plant pot range from Ashortwalk (UK) 'These British eco products are great examples of truly closed loop recycling. The same plant pot recycled at the local garden centre last month is back in the same store being sold as something else, like a bird feeder for example. Based near Truro in Cornwall, this design and manufacturing company offers a range of pioneering eco products, from birdfeeders and clocks to garden accessories such as plant labels, holders and garden chalk boards' Photograph: PR       The Rag and Bone Man 'Rag and Bone man and designer Paul Firbank is a scavenger around London town. He sorts and sifts through the scrap yards, railway arch grease shops and the thrift markets finding the remains of vintage engineered machinery and outmoded modern metal parts that make up scraps of British industrial history. Paul assembles these shiny unwanted fragments into new playful industrial designs and lighting. Restoring, welding, turning, stripping, polishing and lacquering he develops each piece responding to the materials he has found' Photograph: PR       Newlife Paints Ltd (UK) 'Newlife Paints Ltd is based in Ford, West Sussex.

It has been designed for people who are looking for new and innovative ways to save energy. The heatSava is a modern, energy efficient alternative to traditional extract ventilation, ideal for bathrooms, WCs, utility rooms and kitchens in both existing and new homes. The unit continuously extracts stale, moist air from the wet room areas of the home which passes over a high efficiency tubular heat exchange cell. The cell has been cleverly designed to allow the air to cyclone around the barrel, just like a corkscrew, retaining the heat from the extracted air before it reaches atmosphere. At the same time, fresh air from outside is supplied through the tubes where it collects up to 75% of the heat from the extracted air before it is returned back into the room' Photograph: PR       The Great Outdoor Gym Company by TGO UK 'Ideal for professionals focusing on or planning community developments, TGO Green Energy Gym Technology harnesses people power with cardio outdoor gym equipment and then converts it into useable electricity. The human-generated electricity can be used for lighting the zone at night time, to extend the usage of the facility into the evenings but it can be fed into local buildings or even into the National Grid' Photograph: PR  ",

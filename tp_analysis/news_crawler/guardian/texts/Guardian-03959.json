    "text": "A septuagenarian Oxford don once regaled me with the story of how he became a Doctor of Philosophy: &quot;One day, I sat down in the Bodleian. Three years later, I dusted the soot off my shoulders and walked out with a stack of papers to hand to my supervisor for revision.&quot; The tale sounds like a comically antiquated vignette, but many PhDs are still produced in the UK through means not dissimilar. To be sure, regular supervision, transfer-of-status proceedings and training schemes are today the norm. But in a world where it is now acknowledged across professional spheres that aspiring leaders must &quot;spend time living in different countries early in life, so they can appreciate cultural differences, incorporate what they learn into their work lives, and build networks of global relationships&quot;, as John Coleman and Bill George write in the Harvard Business Review, the British PhD remains a predominantly static affair. It is a strange reality given that the basic currency of academia  even if we shy away from naming it this  is thought-leadership. Just as businesses offer their young leaders global training, undertaking a PhD at a British university should provide a vehicle to substantive international opportunity beyond the &quot;field&quot; or &quot;archive&quot; trip, which typically lasts only a few months. The approach makes sense for individuals and for institutions. On a personal level, international exposure at the doctoral stage offers access to new ideas and methodologies in a manner no email &quot;conversation&quot; or online journal can replicate. From an institutional standpoint, it allows young academics to serve as ambassadors from the earliest moment of their professional lives, forging links they can take forward as their careers progress. International experience exposes PhD students to new pedagogical strategies and educational infrastructures, meaning they return to the UK equipped to evaluate the comparative merits of different educational systems, based on first-hand experience. Funding possibilities for PhD students to set sail do exist in the UK, but they are relatively few and far-between. The Arts and Humanities Research Council&apos;s international policy, first implemented in 2006, is partly motivated by its stated goal to &quot;influence the international research agenda&quot; (a monolith of questionable existence), but it does now recognise the value of preparing &quot;the next generation of researchers to work in a global research environment.&quot; The council is taking concrete measures to support that aim, offering its doctoral award-holders opportunities to compete for placements in California, Washington, Delhi and Japan. The Leverhulme Trust, meanwhile, offers Study Abroad Studentships of 12 or 24 months&apos; duration across all disciplines, to be spent at research institutions outside the UK and US. The Fulbright Commission supports study in America. Yet the number of awards available through these and comparable programmes is limited, in some cases hundreds of applicants applying for a handful of places. Application processes typically include lengthy submission forms and personal statements, two or three references, and extensive panel interviews. As Eleanor Spencer, a PhD candidate at Durham University and, like me, recipient of a Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship at Harvard explains: &quot;I started thinking about my application in June and the deadline was in November. I contacted members of the Harvard faculty to ask whether they&apos;d be interested in working with me. I approached potential referees and spent a lot of time on my application statement and research proposal.&quot; On the one hand, the laborious application procedure and competitive nature of these opportunities means that international experience becomes a marker of commitment and distinction. On the other, it means the vast majority of PhDs are produced solely in well-insulated contexts of familiarity, one&apos;s supervisor and department a constant presence over the three to four-year process of thesis-writing. PhDs are supposed to push boundaries of knowledge, not encourage acquiescence; however free-thinking an institution may be, it is surely harder to think anew when fixed in one place, among one group of people. In many ways, the PhD candidate, compared to others in the British higher-education landscape, is most at sea in terms of international opportunity. An Erasmus student exchange year is common among humanities (especially languages) undergraduates. For established academics, international opportunities, sponsored by individual universities and public and private funding-bodies, are relatively widespread. Yet at the PhD stage  which often falls at a time in people&apos;s lives when they are most mobile, when they are yet to be tied down to mortgages and family commitments  funding opportunities are still difficult to come by. It is not fashionable to talk about importing hallmarks of business strategy into academia. But internationalisation in early career is an aspect we need to embrace and encourage. Coleman and George argue that, in the business context, &quot;studying in different cultures enables young leaders to understand cultural nuances and become actively engaged with global organisations&quot;. These outcomes are no different to values promoted by world-class universities. It is imperative, therefore, that British universities and funding-bodies prioritise increased provision for doctoral researchers  who must be considered one variety of young leader  to spend time in research communities around the world.

We want to highlight the best and worst-served communities, and bring attention to the broadband blackspots. Around 14% of UK homes could not get a connection faster than 2 Megabits per second, regarded as the minimum for services like iPlayer, when telecoms watchdog Ofcom undertook its last major study in July 2011. Has the situation improved since then in your area, or do you live in a hard to reach location with no prospect of a broadband line in the near future? Has you community been campaigning to be included on BT&apos;s fibre network? We&apos;d love to hear your experiences. Fill in our online questionnaire below to tell us more and help create the map by sharing your home or office broadband speed. The speed test takes just a few seconds using one of the many online speedometers, which include www.broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk, or www.speedtest.net.   Loading...   NEW!

    "text": "The number of UK beaches failing to meet minimum standards for water quality and pollution has risen after one of the wettest summers on record in 2012. The Marine Conservation Society&apos;s (MCS) annual Good Beach Guide found that 42 beaches failed to meet the minimum European standards for bathing water quality  17 more than in last year&apos;s guide. It recommended only 403 of the 754 bathing beaches tested in 2012 as having excellent water quality  113 less than last year. Months of rain and flooding in many parts of the UK last year washed pollution from towns and cities, farms and sewers into the sea. Sewage and animal waste contains bacteria and viruses that can result in ear, nose or throat infections, and gastroenteritis. &quot;Swimming in water that is subject to faecal pollution is associated with an increased risk of gastroenteritis,&quot; said Paul R Hunter, professor of health protection at the Norwich School of Medicine, University of East Anglia and editor of the Journal of Water and Health. &quot;Faecal pollution in the water is measured by the presence of E coli and enterococci, bacteria that comes from the guts of mammals.&quot; MCS said that bacterial and viral pollution results in an &quot;out of sight, out of mind mentality&quot;, because bathers cannot see the pollution. MCS coastal pollution officer, Rachel Wyatt, said action must be taken to reduce pollution from farms and populated areas. &quot;With stricter bathing water standards from 2015 and summers that appear to be getting wetter, the iconic image of people bathing off golden beaches could be at serious risk. &quot;There is no simple solution to sewage and animal waste reaching our seas. However, if the water industry, communities and local authorities recognise that there is a problem and begin to work together to find answers then that would be a significant start.&quot; The MCS bases its findings on water samples collected by UK environment agencies and local authorities during the previous summer. These are tested for bacterial indicators that show the presence of pollution from sewage and animal waste. This year the MCS recommended fewer beaches in every English region, and in Wales and Scotland. The north-east, north-west and south-west of England, regions that were hit particularly hard by the wet weather, had the fewest number of recommended beaches for at least a decade. The north-east of England was the best-performing region in last year&apos;s guide, but this year only 31 out of 64 beaches were recommended for their excellent water quality  22 less than 2012. Eight beaches failed to meet the minimum standard, compared with none in last year&apos;s guide. North-west England was the worst-performing region in England, with only three out of 37 beaches reaching the highest standard  the lowest number in the region for at least a decade. This year 83 out of 124 beaches in the south-east of England obtained an excellent rating. With all of its beaches reaching the minimum standard, this was the region with the highest percentage of its beaches recommended this year. South-west England was hit particularly hard by the wet weather and flooding of last year. After being one of the best-performing regions in the 2012 guide, this year only 110 of 196 beaches are recommended for excellent water quality. Sixteen beaches, including Plymouth Hoe East and West, Bude Summerleaze in Cornwall and Exmouth in Devon, failed to meet the minimum standard  14 more than last year. This year fewer beaches in Wales and Scotland were recommended for excellent water quality, while Northern Ireland has 15 out of 23 beaches recommended for excellent water quality. But Prof Hunter said that classifying a beach based on a single year&apos;s data was misleading. &quot;A single bad summer shouldn&apos;t really affect a single beach&apos;s classification, and it won&apos;t when the new bathing water directive has been fully implemented,&quot; said Prof Hunter. &quot;But if you&apos;ve got bad beaches consistently over four years, it&apos;s a bad beach full stop.&quot; The current EU bathing water directive is being replaced in 2015 with stricter rules that will also monitor water for the enterococci bacteria and classify beaches over a period of four years. &quot;Under the new directive you won&apos;t get these random variations in beaches that do or do not have blue flags that we&apos;ve seen over the last 10 years, and hopefully that will be more useful and understandable to people,&quot; he said. In November 2012, figures released by the Environment Agency showed that the UK&apos;s beaches were the dirtiest in a decade, with two in five failing national standards for pollution. The wet weather and washout summer were blamed for the surge in sewage, farm and city waste. Last May, after early warnings of drought and a hosepipe ban gave way to heavy rains, raw sewage was flushed into coastal waters at the start of the bathing season. One-third of the 750 beaches tested for the 2012 Good Beach Guide were contaminated by overflowing sewers and run-off from farms or streets.",

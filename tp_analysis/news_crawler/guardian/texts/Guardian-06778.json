    "text": "Double congratulations to you, Ms Mayer, on becoming the fifth CEO (and president) of Yahoo in five years and on the news of your first baby due this October. Impressive! Former Hillary aide Anne-Marie Slaughter calls you &quot;superhuman&quot;, but we&apos;d rather go with Woman 5.0. You hardly need advice from us, but we&apos;ve a couple of suggestions for you, anyway. We&apos;re nervous that you&apos;re the third woman to take the helm over there at Yahoo, and the other two didn&apos;t work out too well. We can only hope the third chick&apos;s a charm. With our help, you should be. Don&apos;t ever change We need an aspirational role model and  tag!  you&apos;re it. You say, &quot;My maternity leave will be a few weeks long and I&apos;ll work throughout it.&quot; Stick to that promise, 21st Century Mama! Don&apos;t let feeding or diaper changes get in the way of running your company. After all, you&apos;ve got it all. Now make it work. Don&apos;t bother moving If living in the Four Seasons has served you well until now, then fine  add on a couple more rooms for Junior and the Help (love that that&apos;s your favorite movie, btw). There&apos;ll be little time for house-hunting between now and October. And the great thing about living in a luxury hotel is when you have to travel for work, you can literally be in a home away from home.     There's no rush to settle down, Ms Mayer. Photograph: Robert Galbraith/Reuters    Get those Yahoos running and walking Way to build community spirit, as you did with your Google team!   &quot;Between July 15 and August 15, I challenged my team to walk an extra 100 miles (beyond the two miles a day the average American office worker walks anyway)  mostly to get us out and enjoying the nice weather. More than 200 people took me up on it and we walked, ran, swam, and biked our way there (we had conversion rates for swimming 1:4 and biking 5:1). All in, we walked close to 30,000 miles, more than once around the Earth at the equator and 16.7 times around the moon.&quot;  We love that you&apos;re a fitness buff. Looking at your ski photos, and reading your account of taking part in the San Francisco marathon is almost as good as watching our pilates video from the couch. We can just feel the pounds dropping off.  Keep shopping the designers Having your former colleague Jess Lee running Polyvore should keep your eye sharp. But don&apos;t forget to let Vogue know every last choice, as you did at your wedding. You&apos;re the graduate school&apos;s Angelina Jolie. Give us all the details from sheath to shorts. We love it when a woman who&apos;s worth hundreds of millions of dollars spends her own money on clothes, especially on &quot;an ivory going-away number based on a design in which Jackie Kennedy toured India&quot;. It makes a nice change from a stylist-clad movie star. Nurture your inner geek You know when you sorted out at the router situation at home?  &quot;I went out and bought a Netgear N600 at Walmart  But, I had continued problems even with the new router  with range and devices getting conflicting IPs (I have a bunch of phones, tablets, TiVos, Google TVs, Apple TVs, etc). So, for Christmas, I asked for an Airport Extreme and 2 Airport Expresses (to chain together and create a mesh with better range). I set them all up last night, got all the devices connecting, and so far, so good. It&apos;s not really a fair comparison, since there are three routers to the Netgear&apos;s 1, but iStumbler showed a lot more signal strength throughout the house, rarely less than 45%.&quot;  May all your domestic problems be as simple to solve. Designate your husband the family chef It was a nice touch telling Martha Stewart you can&apos;t cook. But why should you? If you&apos;re bringing home the bacon, leave it someone else to fry. You say your husband, Zack, is a dab hand in the kitchen. Let him stay there. Or get Jean-Georges over to fix lobster salad again. Or take Zack out for a treat. There&apos;s no law that says new parents have to give up trips to Caviar Russe.            Never stop posting this kind of thing  &quot;Duane Reade carries Kerastase(!) products  yay!&quot;  If something&apos;s gotta give  You can always drop the Walmart board. Trust us. You no longer need it.",

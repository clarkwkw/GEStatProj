    "text": "    This week&apos;s element is lutetium, which has the symbol Lu and the atomic number 71. This is the last of the lanthanoid, or rare earth, series of elements that you will meet. The lanthanoids (also known as lanthanides) are very similar, chemically speaking, and thus, are difficult to separate from each other and purify.  Lutetium was named in honour of Paris, France, which the Romans knew as Lutetia. Often written &quot;lutecium&quot;, the spelling of its name was formalised to its present form in 1949. Interestingly, the Germans knew this element as cassiopeium for a long time after a nasty fight in the scientific literature between two of its three independent discoverers, French scientist Georges Urbain and Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach (the third discoverer, American chemist Charles James, wisely stayed out of this battle.) Like the other lanthanoids, lutetium is never found free in nature. Purified, it is a silvery white metal that is very hard and corrosion-resistant. Since it is the last element in this series, it is the densest of the lanthanoids, which means it feels comparatively heavy when handled.    Although this rare earth is not particularly rare -- it&apos;s more common than silver, for example -- pure lutetium is difficult to prepare. For this reason, it is very expensive (I&apos;ve found prices ranging from US $186/gm to $340/gm [116-212]). A quick comparison shows that lutetium commands a much higher price than either pure platinum (US $53/gm [33]), gold (US $56/gm [35]) or palladium (US $21/gm [13]) [ref]. For this reason, lutetium has few commercial uses. Even though lutetium&apos;s price sends investors&apos; hearts racing, it is rather boring to biologists because it doesn&apos;t have any known biological role (although tiny amounts are found in bone). In fact, lutetium has been accused of being mildly toxic.  Here are our favourite chemists telling us about the wonders of lutetium:            [video link]  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

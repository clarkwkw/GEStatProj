    "text": "Fiona Millar&apos;s respect and support for the Sutton Trust&apos;s work is welcome. Yet her criticism of our proposal to open independent day schools to pupils of all backgrounds is misplaced (The Sutton Trust&apos;s &apos;radical&apos; idea for schools is anything but, Education, 12 June). I was also present at the House of Commons seminar that she refers to on reforms in Finland which led to the abolition of private schools there. If we had a clean slate, a truly comprehensive school system would be my starting point. But there is no chance ofindependent schools being abolishedor their charitable status withdrawn. So the question is what, practically, can be done? Our Open Access proposal is backed by over 80 leading independent day schools, almost half the total, which would, should state funding be available, open their doors to all young people based on ability rather than ability to pay. This would transform the schools at a stroke from bastions of privilege to beacons of opportunity. This is not just theory; it has been tried and tested. In our pilot at the Belvedere school in Liverpool over a seven-year period, 70%of pupils received fee assistance, including one-third on free places. Moreover, an independent evaluation concluded that academic standards improved substantially and there was a negligible impact on local schools, though there was huge gain to individual students. Supporting efforts to improve provision in the state sector and working to democratise independent day schools are not mutually exclusive. We are working on both fronts to address our shamefully low levels of social mobility.Peter LamplChairman, Sutton Trust, and chairman, Education Endowment Foundation",

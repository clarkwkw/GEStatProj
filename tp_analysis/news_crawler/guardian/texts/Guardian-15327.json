    "text": "Google Glass, the wearable computer being developed by the search giant, might be a threat to its owners&apos; privacy because it has no PIN or authentication system, hackers have discovered. Jay Freeman, a Santa Barbara-based programmer who specialises in cracking smartphone security for both iPhone and Android devices, discovered that Glass has a &quot;root&quot; capability which can be enabled by attaching it to a desktop computer and running some commands. That would then give a hacker the ability to take control of the Glass&apos;s output  meaning a hacker could monitor everything the owner was doing from a smartphone in their pocket. &quot;Once the attacker has root on your Glass, they have much more power than if they had access to your phone or even your computer: they have control over a camera and a microphone that are attached to your head,&quot; explains Freeman in a blogpost. &quot;A bugged Glass doesn&apos;t just watch your every move: it watches everything you are looking at (intentionally or furtively) and hears everything you do. The only thing it doesn&apos;t know are your thoughts.&quot; He points out that &quot;it knows all your passwords, for example, as it can watch you type them. It even manages to monitor your usage of otherwise safe, old-fashioned technology: it watches you enter door codes, it takes pictures of your keys, and it records what you write using a pen and paper. Nothing is safe once your Glass has been hacked.&quot; Even if the device shows a red light to show others when its video camera is on, a user probably wouldn&apos;t notice it  because the light would be facing away from them. Freeman reckons that about 10 minutes would be enough for a hacker to install a &quot;rooted&quot; version of the software that Glass ships with. &quot;Sadly, due to the way Glass is currently designed, it is particularly susceptible to the kinds of security issues that tend to plague Android devices,&quot; he writes. &quot;The one saving grace of Android&apos;s track record on security is that most of the bugs people find in it cannot be exploited while the device is PIN-code locked. Google&apos;s Glass, however, does not have any kind of PIN mechanism: when you turn it on, it is immediately usable.&quot; Freeman got hold of one of the demonstration units of Glass, and quickly found that there is a &quot;Debug Mode&quot; which lets it connect to computers over a USB connection. That in turn lets anyone who has access to the device to install their own software if they use certain technical tricks. He recommends that Glass should have a protection system that functions when it is taken off by the owner, such as a biometric  either using patterns in the iris or voice  or a PIN. And for the privacy concerns, both that users have expressed and that Freeman has now opened up, he suggests there would at least be a simple one over worries about the camera: a plastic shield that could slide over the camera. &quot;This makes it clear that &apos;I&apos;m not recording right now&apos;,&quot; he suggests. A Google spokesperson said: &quot;We recognize the importance of building device-specific protections, and we&apos;re experimenting with solutions as we work to make Glass more broadly available.&quot; Sources who know about Google&apos;s thinking on the project say that the &quot;Explorer&quot; program is aimed at developers rather than the average consumer, and that it doesn&apos;t access all of a user&apos;s account details. There is also a &quot;remote wipe&quot; system in the Explorer system, though it&apos;s unclear whether it would work against a hacked device.",

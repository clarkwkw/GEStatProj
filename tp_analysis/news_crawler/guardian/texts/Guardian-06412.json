    "text": "NiGHTS Into Dreams, Sonic Team&apos;s beautiful flying adventure, is to get an HD remake. Sega has been teasing the possibility for a few days, but the project has now been confirmed.  Originally released on the Saturn console in 1996, NiGHTS follows the adventures of two children who must navigate a series of dream lands, aided by the eponymous jester-like character. The game was a visual marvel at the time, with beautifully detailed landscapes and a clever amalgamation of 2D scrolling gameplay and 3D camera navigation. A re-make followed on the PS2, and a Wii sequel Journey of Dreams arrived in 2007, overseen by NiGHTS co-creator, Takashi Iizuka. The HD version will come to Xbox Live, PSN and PC in the autumn, complete with widescreen compatibility, support for leaderboards and achievements. There&apos;s no word on whether we&apos;ll get the extra Christmas NiGHTS levels, originally released in special bundled editions of the Saturn console, or if we&apos;ll see any of the extras included with the PS2 port, including the huge art gallery. But still, this is lovely news for veteran Sega watchers, and something we&apos;re likely to see more of since the company&apos;s shift to a largely digital business model.",

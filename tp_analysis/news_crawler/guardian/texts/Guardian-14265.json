    "text": "Combine traditional 2D platforming with rhythm elements and HarmoKnight is the result  at least that&apos;s the theory. The game requires players to leap through levels, running automatically but doing so in tempo with a cheerful musical backdrop, cracking heads and springing from ledges on the beat. The result is certainly satisfying, and individual stages are designed with plenty of different routes and play styles, offering ample reason to repeat and perfect. While a little lacking in visual delights, at its best HarmoKnight makes for a compelling fusion of sounds, action and characters. A worthy addition to the rhythm-action genre.",

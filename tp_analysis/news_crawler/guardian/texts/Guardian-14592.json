    "text": "There was a fascinating moment during the Q+A part of Google&apos;s first-quarter earnings at the end of last week. Here&apos;s how it came about, as the chief executive Larry Page was being asked about this and that. Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC  Q:...for Larry, could you just discuss the transition in Android management and what exactly Andy Rubin is going to be doing now that he has a new role? Thank you.  And here&apos;s what Page replied. Emphasis added. Larry Page - Chief Executive Officer  [On] the management change question, I think, as we&apos;ve already said, we&apos;ve really exceeded crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android. It&apos;s the most used mobile operating system in the world and a very big thanks to Andy for that. He really decided it was time to hand over the reins and start a new chapter at Google. And we actually have an outside  we haven&apos;t said what that is and I&apos;m not going to make news today on that.  And actually going forward, Sundar [Pichai] is going to lead Android in addition to his existing work on Chrome and apps. He has a great talent for creating products that are really technically excellent yet easy to use and he loves a big bet too. So, we said how that performed I think we had very smooth transition and of course excited about the future.  Note that bit in the middle: Rubin is going to start a new chapter at Google. And Google has an outside something (or someone?) lined up to get involved. An outside company? Executive? Interest? It&apos;s something that will &quot;make news&quot;.  What&apos;s more, it&apos;s something that&apos;s already quite close to happening, because there&apos;s this outside interest (executive? company?).  Where do we look for clues? His Google+ page isn&apos;t that busy - though perhaps you&apos;d expect that a top executive wouldn&apos;t spend much time updating a social networking page. The most recent entry at the time of writing is from the Acer/Alibaba row, which dates back to September 2012. So no clues there. But there&apos;s his letter to Android partners on leaving his position in charge of that, where he said:  I am an entrepreneur at heart and now is the right time for me to start a new chapter within Google. I am amazed by what we have accomplished from those early days (not so long ago!), and remain passionate about the power of a simple idea and a shared goal -- an open source platform freely available to everyone -- to transform computing for people everywhere.  Two things we could probably expect from a Rubin-led project: it will be open-source, and it will be focussed around the early stages of something that could grow very big. Plus it&apos;s likely he&apos;ll focus on something he&apos;s interested in. Don&apos;t forget, Rubin has an amazing record in entrepreneurship. Android was a company he co-founded before selling it to Google in 2005. Before that, he was at Danger - which made the Hiptop, a hugely successful sort-of smartphone. Before that, WebTV Networks, an interactive TV-based online service - acquired in 1995 by Microsoft. And before that he worked at General Magic, one of the proto-companies that has shaped how many of today&apos;s smartphones work. But in his spare time, Rubin is a tinkerer - specifically with robots. Some of creations can, apparently, be found at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, California.  So what could it be that&apos;s coming up from Rubin? Given Rubin&apos;s past, and his interest in robots, could Google be about to do something fascinating with robots? Perhaps drones? Bear in mind that he&apos;s good at spotting the rising tide. Drones are a bit corporate; not many people have the need for their own. But a robot? It&apos;s like the natural follow-on from the self-driving car.  With luck, perhaps we&apos;ll know soon enough. ",

    "text": "Despite what you may have heard, acoustical analysis suggests that (1) most people are not horrible singers, and (2) most horrible singers are not tone deaf  they&apos;re just horrible singers. In 2007, Isabelle Peretz and Jean-Franois Gigure of the University of Montreal, and Simone Dalla Bella, of the University of Finance and Management in Warsaw, tested the abilities of 62 &quot;nonmusicians&quot; in Quebec who admitted to being &quot;occasional singers&quot;. The very act of testing proved more difficult than Dalla Bella, Gigure and Peretz had heard it would be. They published a report, in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, called Singing Proficiency in the General Population. They complain, to anyone who will listen, that it is not easy to measure the goodness or badness of singing. There is &quot;no consensus&quot;, they seem to wail, &quot;on how to obtain ... objective measures of singing proficiency in sung melodies&quot;. They devised their own test, using the refrain from a song called Gens du Pays, which people in Quebec commonly sing as part of their ritual to celebrate a birthday. That refrain, they explain, has 32 notes, a vocal range of less than one octave, and a stable tonal centre. These scientists went to a public park, where they used a clever subterfuge to recruit test subjects: &quot;The experimenter pretended that it was his birthday and that he had made a bet with friends that he could get 100 individuals each to sing the refrain of Gens du Pays for him on this special occasion.&quot; The resulting recordings became the raw material for intensive computer-based analysis, centring on the vowel sounds  the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;mi&quot;, for example. Peretz, Gigure and Dalla Bella assessed each performance for pitch stability, number of pitch interval errors, &quot;changes in pitch directions relative to musical notation&quot;, interval deviation, number of time errors, temporal variability, and timing consistency. For comparison, they recorded and assessed several professional singers performing the same snatch of song. Peretz, Gigure and Dalla Bella give a cheery assessment of the untrained, off-the-street singers: &quot;We found that the majority of individuals can carry a tune with remarkable proficiency. Occasional singers typically sing in time, but are less accurate in pitch as compared to professional singers. When asked to slow down, occasional singers greatly improve in performance, making as few pitch errors as professional singers.&quot; Only a very few, they say, were &quot;clearly out of tune&quot;. The scientists then focused on two of the horrid singers. Both screechers were &quot;aware that they sang out of tune&quot;. They proved to be almost the opposite of tone deaf. When tested, they &quot;correctly detected 90% and 96% of pitch deviations in a melodic context&quot;. Peretz has continued to study the mystery of poor singing. Last year, she and colleague Sean Hutchins finished a comprehensive study. Harmoniously with the earlier finding, they conclude that most bad singers are good at hearing fine sounds, and bad at making them.  Marc Abrahams is organiser of the Ig Nobel prizes.

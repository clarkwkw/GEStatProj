    "text": "It is one of the greatest social, scientific and political dilemmas facing humankind. This week&apos;s Science Weekly is dedicated to exploring the burning question that is the subject of Duncan Clark and Mike Berners-Lee&apos;s new book: how to leave vast untapped reserves of coal, gas and oil in the ground, and somehow find viable alternative forms of energy.  Adam Vaughan, the Guardian&apos;s online environment editor, interviewed Clark, who is a consultant editor on the environment desk and visiting researcher at the UCL Energy Institute, and Berners-Lee, a leading expert on carbon emissions and the author of How Bad Are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything.  To buy a copy of The Burning Question from the Guardian bookshop, click here. Subscribe for free via iTunes to ensure every episode gets delivered.

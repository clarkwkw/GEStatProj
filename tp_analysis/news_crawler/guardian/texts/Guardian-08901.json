    "text": "If ever there was a perfect match of game and hardware, it has surely come in the form of LittleBigPlanet and the PlayStation Vita and, while it may not have the most imaginative of titles, the two do come together to present a wealth of good ideas and enchanting characters. The reason this fourth release in the LittleBigPlanet series is so well suited to its new host device is simple. The game is a platformer  if you&apos;re unfamiliar, think Mario&apos;s early adventures as a reference point. What distinguishes the LittleBigPlanet games from Nintendo&apos;s plumber, however, is that most levels offer two layers of scenery laid over each other, presenting a seemingly 2D world, but with a foreground and background between which protagonist Sackboy can move. Meanwhile, the front and back of the Vita are touch-sensitive; a fact that lets players prod and push the game&apos;s scenery with their fingers between the two planes of movement. The result is some thrilling level design, and an intuitive control system that is only rarely clumsy. Accompanied by magnificent music and an ambitious level creation tool,it LittleBigPlanet&apos;s design rivals the series&apos;s best. It may feel familiar to those that have enjoyed Sackboy&apos;s company before, but is nonetheless a delight to play, making full use of the platformon which it has most assuredly now found anew home.",

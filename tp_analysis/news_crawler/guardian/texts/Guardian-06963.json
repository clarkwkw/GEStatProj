    "text": "Michael Rosen et al (Children must be free to read for fun, Letters, 25 July) refuse to acknowledge that if more children learn to read fluently by having a solid grounding in the alphabetic principle, aka phonics, the enjoyment of real books will increase. For 40 years schools have relied on real books to teach children to read but there has been a consistently large tailback of reluctant readers. Early exposure to simple, phonically decodable stories will ensure that most children get the &quot;reading&quot; thing in key stage 1 and be free to read for fun from then on. Let us not scupper the attempts by the present and previous government to embed phonic teaching in the early years. No child will read for fun until it can read. Margaret FordLondon  Children who are able to generalise from context, the method on which &quot;look and say&quot; reading depends, get off to a flying start with schemes such as Oxford Reading Tree. And they find reading fun. Others have difficulty generalising from context: words mean what they say  and no more. For them, phonics is a great support in decoding the written word. Some children will be able to read only by using phonics. This, of course, makes reading less &quot;fun&quot;. Christine HoodMiddleton Tyas, North Yorkshire  The suggestion that the government&apos;s drive to improve children&apos;s reading poses a threat to reading for pleasure in primary schools is not supported by the evidence. Our policies are intended to ensure that children are taught how to read early in their school career, so that they are able to develop a love of reading. At the moment one in 10 boysleaveprimary school able to read no better than a seven-year-old. International studies rank England 25th for reading  down from seventh nine yearsago. Ensuring all children master the ability to decode words, to sound out new words, is essential if they are tobecome confident readers. The phonics check will ensure no child slipsthrough the net still struggling with this basic skill. Of course, children should be taught in a language-rich environment, be read to and introduced to the joys of books and literature. Developing a love of reading is a key objective of the proposed changes to the primary curriculum. But unless children are first taught the skill of translating text into words, the joy that comes from reading will remain a closed world.Nick Gibb MP Schools minister  Our children start formal education at five compared to the European standard of seven. Even with this head start, 23% of 11-year-olds fail to achieve their literacy milestones. This figure is typical in the English-speaking world so it cannot be blamed entirely on teaching techniques. The acquisition of literacy in English takes up to three times longer than our European competitors, hence the necessity for the early start. We have a cohort of chronic reading underachievers: one-fifth of our working population have a reading age of 13 or less  twice the number in Germany. A huge culprit is our antique and irregular spelling system that virtually guarantees literacy failure. While this is the case, we will continue to search in vain and spend fortunes looking for ways to the elusive goals of mass literacy and children reading for pleasure.Nigel HiltonDeputy chair, English Spelling Society   Recently I did some work at a school in Oughtrington, near Warrington. It took me four goes to spell the village name right and I&apos;ve got an old-style degree in English language and literature. Maybe my teachers should have taught me using synthetic phonics. Frank WelshBalsall Common, West Midlands  I like raeding for fun like the people said in there leter in fact everthing I do I like to be fun. I hate grammer and speling and stuff like that and teechers who made me do it are boring. I&apos;m out of work now and dont understand why I cant get a job. Why isnt life fun all the time! It is what I was used to at skool. Richard WilsonOxford",

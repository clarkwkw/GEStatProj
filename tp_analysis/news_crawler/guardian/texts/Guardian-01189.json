    "text": "Despite gathering to boost intra-African trade, delegates at the African Union (AU) summit in Addis Ababa found discussions overshadowed by a high-profile leadership race. The summit, which ended on Monday, failed to produce a clear winner and another election will be held in Malawi in six months. South Africa&apos;s interior minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, had challenged the incumbent, Jean Ping of Gabon, for the post of AU commission chairman. Before the summit began, the AU&apos;s new headquarters had already courted controversy. Built and paid for by the Chinese, some questioned why the 20-storey building, which was inaugurated on the eve of the summit and is Addis Ababa&apos;s tallest building, wasn&apos;t built by Africans. Meanwhile, ahead of the summit, Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Libya&apos;s deputy foreign minister, said his country&apos;s new government is still taking stock of extensive investments made in Africa by Muammar Gaddafi, former chairman of the AU. Elsewhere on the site Severe food shortages continue to threaten communities in the Sahel. Reporting from Niger, Mark Tran finds erratic rainfall and the global financial predicament are stretching improved crisis preparations to the limit. Earlier this month, the EU&apos;s top humanitarian official, Kristalina Georgieva, visited Niger and Chad and announced new funding for humanitarian work in the region. This week, Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, argues that drought and famine &quot;are not extreme events&quot; but predictable consequences of a global food system in crisis. More must be done, he says, to plan for food crises and to address underlying issues. We report on the announcement that 13 of the world&apos;s biggest drug companies are to donate more medicines and work together to research new antidotes. Calestous Juma suggests that Nigeria and other African countries should use investments in infrastructure to help foster new approaches to job creation and skills development, especially for young people. Following an under-reported UN statistics symposium, we examine the Food and Agriculture Organisation&apos;s global hunger figures and ask why the uncertainty surrounding the numbers doesn&apos;t receive more attention. And we look at a new UN report calling for a set of sustainable development indicators that go beyond GDP and other traditional measures of progress.

Coming up on the site Following news that - with a new general manager and a $750m pledge from Bill Gates in the offing - the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria may soon be revitalised, we look at what to expect from the fund 10 years after it was established. We&apos;ll assess whether Liberia will meet its targets on extending energy access to local communities.

Multimedia Podcast: Tunisia, Egypt, and the global jobs crisis Growing unemployment threatens social cohesion around the world.

In pictures: Guatemalans march against domestic violence Around 12,000 people climbed an inactive volcano near the capital, Guatemala City, last week to protest against domestic violence in the country. In pictures: African Union leaders convene in Addis Ababa An eventful AU summit took in the unveiling of the organisation&apos;s new headquarters, the introduction of a new chairman, an attempt to defuse an oil export row between Sudan and South Sudan, and an AU commission leadership contest impasse. What you said: some of the best comments from our readers On David McNair&apos;s blog on funding the millennium development goals, DerejeAlemayehu says:  As long as power relations and structures prevail, nationally and internationally, that contribute to the perpetuation of poverty, no amount of money could help us achieve the MDGs   On our talk point on tackling the global jobs crisis, Ethnicsupplies writes:  Access to electricity is a big deal too and has led to protests. It is not uncommon to have power cuts for 7-9 working hours. A combination of increased interest rates and interrupted electricity is challenging business owners and is guaranteed to have implications for the economy too.  On our blog on FAO figures, NatashaAdams writes:  Moving on to food prices, when these go up people eat either less or less nutritious food, but the latter shouldn&apos;t be seen as less serious. Eating less nutritious food leads to malnutrition, which can cause serious health problems.  Highlights from the blogosphere On the Overseas Development Institute&apos;s website, Raphalle Faure and Dirk Willem te Velde review The Future We Want, the official preparatory document for the June 2012 Rio+20 summit. On the World Bank&apos;s Africa Can  End Poverty blog, Aaditya Mattoo argues that land-locked African countries, sometimes dubbed &quot;victims of geography&quot;, exacerbate their problems by restricting trade of key &quot;linking&quot; services such as transport and communication. On his blog From Poverty to Power, Duncan Green looks at Oxfam&apos;s dilemma over whether to open the swimming pool at its Nairobi guesthouse. &quot;Oxfam&apos;s big cheeses saw a tabloid scandal in the making and closed it,&quot; writes Green.

    "text": "What do the pit ponies really think about the strike? Many of us do not believe that they think at all, nor that they know anything about the reason of their present changed conditions, but certainly they can feel and appreciate that there is change. Is it great joy to them to come up into the fields? Some of them no doubt do enjoy the rest, the light, and the fresh air, as well as the change from hay to growing grass, but it is conceivable that to others it is painful. Animals, like many of us superior creatures who like to think that we are not animals, may be slaves of habit. Lack of regular employment and exercise may bore them, light may be trying to eyes accustomed to gloom, and raw, cold, and chilly rain may be positively painful to hides which have got used to a dry, warm, and equable temperature. There is yet another source of possible sorrow - the absence of a friend. Much has been written about cruelty to pit ponies, and no doubt there are cases of brutality, just as there are to the horses in our streets, but the miner is too passionately fond of animals to be guilty of systematic cruelty. Many of the ponies will miss the voice, the caress, and the companionship of the man or lad who has worked with them.",

    "headline": "Hurricane-ravaged Haiti has 'alarming' levels of hunger and malnutrition", 
    "text": "Haiti, devastated by successive natural disasters including hurricane Matthew last week and a massive earthquake in 2010, is one of a handful of countries still suffering alarming levels of hunger, according to the annual global hunger index (GHI). More than half the 10 million population of the Caribbean country were undernourished before Matthew struck but the report suggests that little or no progress has been made in eradicating hunger there in the past 15 years.    top 15   The index, which annually measures levels of malnutrition, stunting and the mortality rates of under fives in 129 countries, reports that about 795 million people  more than the total population of Latin America  are said to be chronically undernourished today, while roughly one in four children are stunted and 8% of the worlds children suffer from wasting.  But the number of hungry people has fallen by nearly 210 million since 2000 and some countries have improved dramatically, say the authors. Myanmar, Rwanda and Cambodia have each halved the proportions of undernourished people since 1992.  Haiti, Zambia, and Central African Republic have the highest proportion of undernourished people  between 47.7% and 53.4% of the population. Timor-Leste, Burundi and Papua New Guinea have the highest prevalence of stunting, with 50% or more under-fives so undernourished that they are too short for their age. Somalia, Chad and Angola have the highest under-five mortality rates, ranging between 13.7% and 15.7%. According to the report, compiled by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and Concern Worldwide, levels of hunger are still serious or alarming in 50 countries. Central African Republic (CAR) and Chad have barely reduced hunger since 2000, it says. Violence and mass displacement caused by a four-year civil war have taken a heavy toll on food production in CAR and a recent influx of refugees and extreme weather events have left Chad desperately food insecure.  The situation could be worse, say the authors, because insufficient data was available for 13 countries, of which 10 were cause for concern. Burundi, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Syria were all thought to be in trouble.  However, the index suggests many developing countries are making strong progress with an overall drop of 29% in the level of hunger since 2000. But Namibia and Sri Lanka stood out for having the lowest percentage reductions since 2000. The speed of improvement in eradicating hunger is desperately slow, say the authors. If hunger declines at the same rate as it has since 1992, more than 45 countries will still have moderate to alarming levels in 2030. The 2030 agenda for sustainable development has a goal of zero hunger for all by 2030.   reduction   The MDG target of halving the percentage of the population experiencing chronic hunger was met by 73 of 129 countries, and the number of the chronically hungry has fallen by 210 million. However, almost 800 million people still do not have enough food to eat to lead healthy and fulfilling lives, says the report. In terms of the major regions of the developing world, sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia have the highest 2016 GHI scores, at 30.1 and 29.0 respectively. Data on the indicators comes from the UNs Food and Agriculture Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the UNs childrens charity, Unicef, and IFPRI estimates. The cost of hunger is measured not only in lost lives but also in unrealised potential for individuals, say the reports authors. It affects the ability of communities, countries and regions to meet their own social development goals, and it stunts their economic prosperity. How we choose to grow, process, distribute and consume the food we eat will have a profound effect on people, planet, prosperity and peace. Rose Caldwell, director of Concern Worldwide UK, said: The world has made progress in the fight against hunger but it has so far been too slow; we wont reach the globally agreed target of zero hunger by 2030 if we carry on at the same rate. Hunger continues to waste lives and limit potential  we need urgent action from the global community to wipe it out for good. Declines in average hunger levels across regions or individual countries do not tell the whole story. Even within regions and countries that have broadly reduced hunger to low levels, lagging areas are leaving millions still hungry, and demonstrate the need to target solutions to communities facing the greatest need. Haiti, for example, has the fourth highest GHI score at an alarming 36.9, despite the Latin America region having the lowest regional GHI score in the developing world. Mexico has a low level of overall hunger, but also has areas where child stunting  an indicator of child undernutrition  is relatively high. The 2030 agenda set a clear global objective for an end to hunger  everywhere  within the next 14 years, said David Nabarro, special adviser to the UN secretary general on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and climate change. Too many people are hungry today. There is a need for urgent, thoughtful and innovative action to ensure that no one ever goes hungry again.    Table ",

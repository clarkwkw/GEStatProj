    "text": "So a new day has begun and you have checked your personal email, glanced over your facebook and google+ pages whilst eating breakfast, and even watched a video whilst sipping your coffee. Wikipedia, Google, Boing Boing and Reddit are all back online. Even a few US senators have changed their minds and announced on twitter that they now oppose PIPA. So it looks like the internet hasn&apos;t been irreparably broken despite the voluntary blackout of a number of large sites yesterday. So now what? Should we all just go on with our lives as if nothing has happened? This is the end to the legal attacks upon our right to share information with others, right?    Wrong. This isn&apos;t the end. The SOPA/PIPA bills have not yet been decided (that happens next week), so we need to keep telling American congresscritters that this legislation will damage the public&apos;s online freedoms -- and how.  This wasn&apos;t the beginning, either. SOPA/PIPA are just the part of what looks to be a long series of attacks upon the public&apos;s freedom to create, discuss, read, watch, link and share information with others. For our entire lives, we&apos;ve been groomed to passively purchase and consume whatever media that large corporations have decided to shove down our throats, and more such attacks are on the way. Corporations, like politicians, are going to try to wear us down so they finally get their way. To protect our freedoms, we must always remain vigilant.  But part of vigilance is being able to recognise such an attack when it happens, so it is important to understand what bills like SOPA/PIPA mean to our shareable online world. This video is a short presentation by Clay Shirky about the context and underlying motivations for SOPA/PIPA. In this video, Mr Shirky delivers a manifesto -- a call to defend our freedom to create, discuss, link and share, rather than passively consume:             Visit TEDtalksDirector&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].

    "text": "An &quot;open data&quot; revolution kicked off by a Guardian campaign is gathering pace in the UK. The Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, is trumpeting the UK&apos;s success in making government data freely available - and pointing to examples of companies that have sprung up to create commercial businesses around free data from public bodies. Maude says that &quot;companies including SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] and startups are using open data to improve public services and create innovative products.&quot; But, he adds, he wants both &quot;data holders&quot; in government and new data-driven businesses to &quot;promote the open data revolution&quot;. The Cabinet Office cited a number of startup businesses which use government-supplied free data as their core input, from Parkopedia - which uses live data from local authorities to help drivers find free care parking spaces, and now covers more than 20m space in 25 countries - to Placr, which pulls together data from public transport operators to provide a nexus of data which is then available to users, developers and service operators themselves. Other companies cited include CycleStreets and the Barclays Bike Hire scheme in London, which offers real-time data to developers who have in turn created a dozen apps for smartphones to help people find the nearest and best-stocked bicycle hire station to them.  One of the newest apps to appear using government data is an iPhone all called Your Taxi Meter, which uses live data from local councils to find out from a car&apos;s registration number whether it is a licensed taxi - so that would-be passengers can check on it before they get in. It also gives taxi fare estimates for more than 360 districts across the UK, using fares set by local government. &quot;Without the data provided by the local councils for free, the service would not be possible,&quot; says Tom Macmichael, its creator. The explosion in open data in government followed the success of the Free Our Data campaign, launched in the Guardian in March 2006. That advocated making non-personal data collected by government available for uncharged re-use, whether by individuals or businesses - and was adopted by Tom Watson, then Cabinet Office minister in Gordon Brown&apos;s administration. That led to a key move in April 2010 when Ordnance Survey map data, which had previously been charged for, was made available for free - along with a database of postcodes and their geographic locations. In a speech on Wednesday, Maude will praise the efforts of both government and developers. He will say that &quot;The digital age has made transparency an irresistible, unstoppable force,&quot; and that open data &quot;will be the essential characteristic of future public policy&quot;. He points out that data about cardiac surgery led to the discovery of huge variations in mortality data across the UK, and thus to the elimination of bad practices. &quot;It can save lives,&quot; he says of the open data movement. The availability of open data from government - in effect making data collected with taxpayer funds available back to them - has led to commercial businesses which are just getting off the ground. Jonathan Raper, the chief executive of Placr, was on Tuesday visiting Blackpool where he hopes to seal a contract offering his company&apos;s services - which are built around public data - that will cement its position. Placr already employs three staff, and the tax bill was probably enough in 2011 to pay for a teaching assistant at a school, says Raper: &quot;so we feel we&apos;ve begun to do our part.&quot;  But Raper said that there is still huge amounts of work to do inside government, where willingness to making data open is still variable from ministry to ministry. &quot;I&apos;d give the government six out of ten so far - the have tried hard. But now they&apos;ve reached a checkpoint. Reforming government isn&apos;t easy, but at the same time this is the time, economically, when we desperately need growth. When we have data lying around inside government that we could reuse for free, at no cost, then why does that task get put into the &apos;too difficult&apos; box?&quot; He said that investors in private companies using public data still needed persuading that the government would give them both the continued backing and guaranteed access in future to open data - something that Maude has repeated, but which is yet to be enacted through legislation.",

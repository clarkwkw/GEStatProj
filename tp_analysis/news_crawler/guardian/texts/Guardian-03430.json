    "text": "Britain&apos;s leading aid groups will seek to recreate the high point of the international development movement when they launch a second Make Poverty History campaign to coincide with David Cameron taking the chair of the G8 group of rich nations next year. Talks between charities are at an advanced stage for action in 2013, designed to match the propaganda offensive in the runup to the 2005 Gleneagles summit that successfully put pressure on the richest countries of the west to help poor nations. Make Poverty History 2 will concentrate on hunger, which has become a key issue in recent years as rising commodity prices have pushed up the cost of food for the world&apos;s poorest people. The government has been made aware of the plans and is supportive of a campaign that would dovetail with its own food-dominated agenda for the G8. World Bank figures show that the spike in commodity prices in 2007-08 kept or pushed an additional 105 million people below the poverty line, and prices returned to those high levels in 2011. A communique released at the end of the World Bank&apos;s spring meeting said higher and more volatile food prices threatened attempts to meet the 2015 millennium development goals for poverty reduction. &quot;Food insecurity and malnutrition have devastating effects, especially on women and children,&quot; it added. Sources in the development community said that while the details had yet to be finalised, it was extremely likely that the different groups could agree a joint strategy. The effort will come to a climax either at the G8 or at a special summit in Britain that would involve a broader group of countries. Charities think the prospect of the UK government throwing its weight behind the campaign  as it did in 2005  have been enhanced by the coalition&apos;s decision to ringfence the aid budget and by the decision of the UN secretary general Ban-Ki moon to ask the prime minister to take charge of a UN committee defining future development goals. The Gleneagles summit announced plans to double aid, eradicate debt and free up trade, and is widely seen as the zenith of the anti-poverty movement. Privately, charities admit some of the energy has gone out of the campaign during a period when the financial crisis has made rich countries less inclined to be generous. Sources said Make Poverty History 2 would be on a scale similar to the original and would be the first time the development community had come together since 2005. The campaign is also likely to focus on making rich countries hit the United Nations target of 0.7% of national output, and on tax transparency, including a crackdown on offshore tax havens. Talks have included all the leading UK aid charities, including Save the Children, Oxfam, Christian Aid, and One, the campaign group set up by rock star activists Bono and Bob Geldof. Environmental group such as Friends of the Earth and the RSPB have also been involved in the preliminary planning for the campaign. Early discussions have taken place about an event to match the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park that took place just before the Gleneagles meeting, but sources said nothing had been decided. Brendan Cox, of Save the Children, said: &quot;The giants are starting to stir and they are thinking about something significant and big.&quot; Adrian Lovett, Europe Executive director at One, said: &quot;We&apos;re excited about working together to capture the imagination of the British public and challenge David Cameron to seize this unique opportunity for global leadership in the fight against hunger and poverty. Africa&apos;s future lies in Africa&apos;s hands  but all of us, including ONE&apos;s 3 million members, have a part to play.&quot; The development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, said next year&apos;s G8 would focus on food, hunger, agriculture and nutrition. &quot;I am pleased the NGOs have identified these issues because they are the right ones, &quot;We haven&apos;t yet decided what to do with the G8 but given Britain&apos;s development leadership we will try to crowd in others to have a real impact.&quot; he said. The United States, which hosts this year&apos;s G8 meeting next month, has picked food security as the theme, and Mitchell said the UK would pursue a similar agenda in 2013. One possible goal would be to remove a certain number of people from food insecurity. &quot;The government and the NGOs are on the same page,&quot; the development secretary added. Max Lawson, senior policy adviser at Oxfam, said: &quot;If it goes ahead, a campaign like this would be fantastic  millions united in challenging governments to fix the broken food system and meet their promises to the poorest.&quot;",

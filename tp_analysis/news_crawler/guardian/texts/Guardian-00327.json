    "text": "If a time traveler from the late 1800s were to visit the present, the one place that she would recognize and, in many cases, feel right at home in, would be academia. Todays universities and other science institutions are often the sole exception to the percussive pace of change we are now seeing in society and nature. They are, in a word, slow. But that contemplative, reflective pace that defines academia has a growing number of researchers worried that science is too often left sitting at the kids table while decisions are made elsewhere - especially in todays rapidly changing world.  Nowhere is this more true than in the planning for the future of our cities. Over the coming week, tens of thousands of people will spill into Quito, Ecuador, for Habitat III, a United Nations Conference that will set the course for the development of cities around the world. At La Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana Benjamn Carrin in Quito, delegates from nations around the world will vote to approve the New Urban Agenda. Its a bulging document that details pathways for the growth of cities in the next two decades. Meanwhile, somewhere in the 1.5 acres of exhibition space located almost a half mile from where the leaders are meeting, if you look carefully, you can find a 20-foot by 20-foot space focused on research. There, Future Earth, the International Council for Science (ICSU) and Potsdam University in Germany are organizing an exhibit space on the science of cities. Its a bubble of science all but lost in a sea of policy.  This observation meshes with what many in the urban research community have been saying for months: Science and diverse fields of urban researchers have played a minimal role in Habitat III. In a commentary published this week in the journal Nature, a group of prominent urban researchers write: One reason is that the scientific community was unprepared for Habitat III. The few scientists invited to participate accepted a consultative role, nested among other public voices. Its not an isolated occurrence, either. Cities use an estimated 70 percent of the worlds energy. But only recently has the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), perhaps the worlds most well-known body for international science, given special attention to the needs of cities. This year, the IPCC agreed to produce a special report on climate change and cities, due out in 2023 to 2028. Effectively, however, climate scientists have for years been cut off from the leaders who make decisions with huge consequences for climate change: Town mayors, city departments, local non-profit organizations and others. Still, there is momentum building toward a type of science that can keep pace with the speed of change round the world. Researchers with The Luc Hoffmann Institute at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), for example, have convened a team of diverse experts to comb through mountains of data collected through the Earth Hour City Challenge -- a global coalition of cities that are collecting and distributing data on how they are working to respond to climate change. From this work, the team is building a map of how urban areas are tackling climate change and the key points that different cities are using to rapidly shift their carbon footprint.  This momentum, and the solutions for global challenges cropping up all over the world, is the focus of a new magazine that Future Earth will launch at Habitat III. The magazine takes its name from the Anthropocene, the word for a new epoch in the geologic history of the planet defined by humanitys wide-reaching impacts on the planet. Anthropocene: Innovation in the Human Age is a magazine focused on innovation and science that is fast, relevant to society and committed to spurring solutions The first issue, which has a special focus on cities, includes stories about driverless cars and the unlikely path that our electronic gadgets take when we throw them out.  The speed of change in this new human age -- from the ballooning use of fossil fuels to rising seas and disappearing natural ecosystems -- is at odds with the slow, contemplative nature of science. But Anthropocene magazine will work to merge those two worlds. The publication produces daily digests of sustainability science from around the world, but it will also take time to reflect on the nature of the Anthropocene itself. In this first issue, for example, veteran New York Times science journalist Andrew Revkin reflects on how his own thinking around the Anthropocene has changed over the years. He writes: Lately Ive come to realize that my lifelong beat, in essence, has been one species growing pains. Science is going through growing pains, too. But it may be on the verge of finding a new maturity. ",

    "text": "As suggested by the words &quot;winner of 80 game of the year awards&quot; emblazoned on its cover, Telltale&apos;s downloadable horror game The Walking Dead was a runaway success when originally released in episodic form last year. Here, for those who still enjoy owning hard copies or who simply missed it, is the (slightly pricier) boxed version. Split across five episodes, the game tells the story of a convict, Lee, who stumbles upon and cares for a young girl called Clementineduring the zombie apocalypse, as portrayed in the comicbooks. Far from being another zombie shooter, The Walking Dead is a story-driven point-and-click adventure. Players must interact with survivors, manage quick-time events and investigate mysteries in an effort to escape the hungry hordes. The choices players make in doing so have a genuine impact on who survives, who doesn&apos;t and how your relationships with characters develop, making each game a different experience and encouraging you to start over once the story is finished. Much like its source material (the comic rather than the TV series), it can get very bleak in places. But with a compelling script, stunning comic book visuals and excellent voice acting, this is one of the finest examples of video game storytelling yet to be made.",

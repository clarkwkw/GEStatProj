    "text": "Perpetual motion games have proved a big hit on mobiles  thriving on bursts of intensely pressured gameplay in the object-hurtles-towards-dangerous-obstacle mould, with only the player&apos;s hand-eye co-ordination to prolong the agony. My Army (iPhone, Distinctive Developments, 69p) pushes this further. With a top-down perspective reminiscent of Cannon Fodder, a squadron of four soldiers heads into enemy territory. To start, you tilt the iPhone to manoeuvre around obstacles, barbed wire and mines, before hails of gunfire are added, then rockets and bombs that must be swept from the screen. Returning fire is vital for buying time  but ammo is limited and crates must be collected to replenish supplies. Dead soldiers can be replaced with rescued PoWs but once all the men are down it&apos;s game over. Repeated attempts to top that high score inevitably follow, along with much tilting, swiping, gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair  hallmarks of the just-one-more-go greats.",

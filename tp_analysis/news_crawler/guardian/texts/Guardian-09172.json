    "text": "The row over student visas at London Metropolitan university has done &quot;huge damage to the image of British higher education&quot;, according to the new head of the London School of Economics. In his first interview since starting the job, Craig Calhoun said the crisis over overseas students at London Met, in north London, had &quot;played in places like India as a gratuitous assault on, and insult to, Indian students&quot;. Calhoun revealed that he and other British vice-chancellors are been lobbying the government over the requirement that overseas students must register with police within seven days of arrival. Increased demand has led to students queueing overnight outside the south London office where they must register. Calhoun said: &quot;I think perhaps an even more inexplicable act of gratuitous embarrassment is the police registration system. First off it&apos;s pointless because this information is already gathered when people get visas. The whole registration system should be scrapped. &quot;Secondly, if you were going to require registration, and tell students they have seven days to register with the police, then you have an obligation to make it possible. It could not be better organised if the goal was to embarrass the government of the country.&quot; The Metropolitan police last night agreed to change the procedure for overseas students in London. From Monday, universities will be able to coordinate the process for them, while students will have until 31 December rather than just seven days to comply. The UK Border Agency revoked London Met&apos;s licence to take overseas students in August, saying the university &quot;failed to address serious and systematic failings&quot;. The decision affected up to 2,600 and left the university, which denied the claims, facing a 30m loss. London Met has since won a partial victory in the courts, which allowed 1,000 students to start their courses. In a statement, a UK Border Agency spokesman defended the decision to revoke the licence as &quot;the right course of action&quot;. He said: &quot;We will continue to fight their [legal] challenge at the full hearing.&quot; The LSE, where almost half of students were from outside the EEA in 2010-11, is heavily reliant on overseas income. Calhoun is the successor to Howard Davies, who quit last year over LSE&apos;s links to the Gaddafi regime. The new director called for students to be exempt from the government&apos;s immigration cap. He said: &quot;The LSE and Oxford and Cambridge and every other university suffers when the image of British higher education is undermined.&quot; In the interview, Calhoun indicated that the LSE&apos;s tuition fee for home undergraduates is likely to be revised upwards from the 8,500 a year it currently charges. Alone among Russell Group institutions, it does not charge the maximum of 9,000. Calhoun said the fee would be reviewed in the knowledge that it had not deterred applicants. The university, he said knew that its applicants understood the &quot;difference between sticker price and bottom line&quot;. &quot;My own preference would be that fees be set in a way that covers the cost of enrolling students at a first-rate institution and that we also secure other revenue so that we can provide scholarships to reduce how much of these fees we have to charge students that are less well-off.&quot; The LSE is undertaking a strategic review that will examine underperforming areas and look at whether it should take on more students. The review will also examine whether the LSE should set up an overseas campus, as the universities minister, David Willetts, is urging it to do. Calhoun said: &quot;We&apos;re undertaking a strategic review to look at everything from the size and shape of school, the proportion of graduate to undergraduate [degrees]. I think we need to look at the whole offer.&quot; The LSE has more than doubled its intake between 1980 and 2010. Calhoun said the review would look at whether the university was now the right size or should expand further. Some of Britain&apos;s top universities have grown this year by taking advantage of new freedoms to recruit unlimited numbers of UK undergraduates with A-level grades of AAB or higher. In London, Kings and University College London have &quot;grown substantially&quot;, Calhoun noted. UCL was due to add another 300 British undergraduates this academic year, and is expanding beyond its Bloomsbury home to a new campus in Newham, east London. Calhoun said: &quot;There are possible reasons to grow in the lifting of the AAB cap, in the extent to which our neighbours like Kings or UCL have grown substantially. We should consider that. It doesn&apos;t mean that we&apos;ll choose it. We might decide its a mistake and we want to avoid it.&quot; The LSE director is also keen for the university to &quot;connect up the different fields&quot; in which it operates. &quot;The way in which we look at climate change has something that connects geography to economics, the way we look at cities as something that connects sociology to geography to economics to other fields. &quot;Lots of the innovation in social science comes from crossing boundaries, bringing together people who have different backgrounds to look at the same question. I have no immediate agenda to create a new department. There&apos;s no discipline that I think is missing. The issue is whether we are bringing together the different kinds of perspectives we need to tackle the questions we have today.&quot;",

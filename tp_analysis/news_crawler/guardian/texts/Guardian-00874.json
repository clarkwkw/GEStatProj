[I will identify this bird for you in 48 hours] Image: Nick Athanas/Tropical Birding, 8 November 2011 (with permission) [velociraptorize]. Canon EOS 7D   This South American mystery bird is notable amongst its congeners for one of its traits. Which trait might that be? Can you name these birds&apos; taxonomic family and species? About the Daily Mystery Bird:  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones around the globe, and some people are following on their mobile phones. So let everyone play the game. Wait to identify the bird until 24 to 36 hours after it&apos;s been published.2. If you know the bird&apos;s identity, provide subtle hints to let others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful as small clues to less experienced players. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones.4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too).2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all.4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.  If you have bird images, video or mp3 files that you&apos;d like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at The Guardian, feel free to contact me to learn more.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientistevil google+: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

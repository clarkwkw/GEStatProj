    "text": "Sky News, part-owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, below, has lost its bid to run the Australian government&apos;s international news and English language teaching broadcasting service after ministers cancelled a controversial tender process last month. The government said that the $230m Australia Network tender should be abandoned and the contract awarded permanently to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the state broadcaster that has been running the service since 2001. Australia Network, which has an audience of over 100 million in 44 countries, mainly in Asia and the Pacific, is a leading broadcaster of ELT programming. The original tender document, issued last February, bound bidders to continue to produce &quot;high-quality&quot; ELT content. ELT programmes were downloaded from the Australia Network website over 200,000 times during November, according to ABC spokeswoman Sally Cray. &quot;ABC&apos;s English language programmes across the Asia Pacific are very popular especially in pod and vodcast formats where the audience can personalise the service and watch or listen when it suits them,&quot; She said. The government said it was in &quot;the national interest&quot; to cancel the tender process after the independent panel set up to evaluate bids was reported to have unanimously backed Sky. Communications minister Stephen Conroy said the leaks compromised the process. Singapore to scrap language test for foreign maids English language tests for foreign maids seeking work in Singapore will be scrapped from June, authorities announced last month. Mandatory testing of domestic staff, introduced in 2005, will be replaced by a &quot;settling-in programme&quot;, including training in stress management and adapting to life abroad. The test was blamed for putting job seekers, coming mainly from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Burma, under undue stress, with many candidates failing to meet required standards. &quot;While the entry test was introduced with good intentions  it is not a meaningful measure of quality and does not guarantee that the worker understands the English language,&quot; Tan Chuang-Jin of Singapore&apos;s manpower ministry said. Insider trading charges in schools sale The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued four Chinese citizens on charges of insider dealing for allegedly making more than $2.7m in profits by buying shares in the Chinese English language schools chain Global Education and Technology shortly before it was sold to Pearson last November for $155m. According to the SEC complaint one of the individuals, Lili Wang, a 45-year-old Beijing resident, was allegedly &quot;tipped about the Global Education acquisition prior to its public announcement given her connection to Xiaodong Zhang&quot;, Global Education&apos;s co-founder and chairman. Rwanda &apos;failing&apos; to lure mentors from Kenya A plan to attract experienced English language teachers to Rwanda from Kenya to help local teachers switch from French to English as the medium of instruction has failed because of low pay on offer, according to press reports. The Rwanda Education Board (REB) will not achieve its target to recruit 4,000 out-of-work Kenyan teachers to work as trainers because the pay on offer is not a sufficient incentive, the Rwanda Focus newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted unconfirmed reports that the REB was offering $700 a month, but Kenyan staff expected more than double that. British Council&apos;s return toLibya announced The British Council will resume in March its English language teaching operation in Libya, suspended after the outbreak of civil war last February, according to the UK minister, Alistair Burt. The Council had a staff of 50 teachers in the country in 2011. Max de Lotbinire max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com",

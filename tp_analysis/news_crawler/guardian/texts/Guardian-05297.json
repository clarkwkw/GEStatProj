He&apos;s not very bright, but he&apos;s charming, playful and has a passion for boxes. In this minimalistic video, we check in with Maru and find that he&apos;s alive and well and indulging his fondness for boxes as he inspects recycle bins.               Visit mugumogu&apos;s YouTube channel [video link] This could be made into a rather sweet public service ad, don&apos;t you think?  More Maru:  Schrdinger&apos;s cats?  I am Maru  The small box experiment  Paper bags: Maru&apos;s new love NOTE: the silly cat/pet/animal videos that are shared here on Saturday (Caturday) mornings are intended to amuse. This feature is designed to help hard-working and stressed-out people shed their professional faade so they can be better friends, companions, parents, family members and drinking pals to those in their personal lives. Any relationship between these videos and science or any scientific principle is sweet when I manage to present a solid connection to you, but is random, usually coincidental and mostly unintended.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist email: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

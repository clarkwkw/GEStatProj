    "text": "As the Guardian unveils its 2014 university guide, this year&apos;s rankings are set to be more influential than ever. And that&apos;s because, as new research has just shown, students base their decisions about which courses to apply for on the Guardian guide. Economists at Royal Holloway, University of London, analysed university application data for the past eight years to see how scores given to institution departments by the Guardian affected the number of student applications they received. The researchers made two findings: subject departments that score highly in the tables get more applications, and, tuition fees are making league tables more influential. According to the study, individual departments moving up a subject-level league table experienced a rise in applications of almost 5%, with the increase most pronounced among overseas applicants. Changes to student number control, which allow universities to recruit for more high-achievers, mean that league tables will become more influential as universities vie for extra students, says Xiaoxuan Jia, the report author. &quot;As the market for higher education gets liberalised and institutions become freer in recruiting the best home and EU students, the income effect of the Guardian ranking will increase.&quot; Researchers say based their study on the Guardian&apos;s guide because it is &quot;easily accessible and currently the most popular.&quot; Universities already pay close attention to league tables, but the report authors added that university administrators may wish to, &quot;review their resource allocation based on the criteria used to construct those league tables on a regular basis, to improve and sustain their respective ranking performance.&quot; Carl Gilleard, chief executive of Association of Graduate Recruiters says universities recognise that, especially after the fee rise, students want a return on their investment in education. &quot;The senior management at institutions are paying far more attention to league tables and employability statistics than ever before, and that will prove to be the best catalyst for bringing about changes to the student experience  and changes for the better.&quot; It&apos;s not just universities that are keeping an eye on league tables  they&apos;re also watched keenly by graduate employers, adds Gilleard. &quot;Recruiters base their decisions about which universities to target on a number of factors, one of which is the reputation of an institution.&quot; University league tables aren&apos;t without their critics  and, as career advisers point out  they shouldn&apos;t be the only resource students consult when applying to university. But the Guardian&apos;s rankings, which unlike other league tables prioritise student experience, is the place to start.",

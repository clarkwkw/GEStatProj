    "text": "     The high-level panel appointed by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to draw up a post-2015 development agenda might well be casting envious backward glances at the small team that drafted the millennium development goals (MDGs). Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, then the head of the UN Development Programme, explains how he and the small group wrote up the MDGs in the basement of the UN office in New York in &quot;relative casualness&quot;, so much so they almost forgot to include a section on the environment  MDG seven on environmental sustainability. &quot;The document had gone to the printing presses as I passed the head of the UN&apos;s environmental programme,&quot; says Malloch-Brown (video). &quot;I was walking along the corridor, relieved at job done, when I ran into the beaming head of the UN environment programme and a terrible swearword crossed my mind when I realised we&apos;d forgotten an environmental goal  we raced back to put in the sustainable development goal.&quot; Unlike the sometimes improvised nature of the MDGs, the post-2015 development framework promises to be a more elaborately choreographed affair. Ban has appointed three co-chairs  the UK prime minister David Cameron, the Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  to head a panel of 26 experts. Their job is to produce a &quot;bold and ambitious&quot; report by the end of May. To avoid the impression that the new framework is being cooked up by experts in a backroom  or basement  there is an ambitious outreach programme. Malloch-Brown commends the effort to consult widely but worries about the &quot;committee-isation&quot; of the process. In an interview at his office at FTI Consulting in London, Malloch-Brown says the eight MDGs melded a human-rights based approach embodied in the Human Development Report; a World Bank pro-market structural adjustment strategy; and the target-setting mindset of rich donors in the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. &quot;The development of the MDGs was a bit like nuclear fusion,&quot; he said. &quot;There was a lot going on in lots of labs.&quot; Malloch-Brown credits Kofi Annan, the then UN secretary general, backed by the Labour government, including a high-profile development secretary, Clare Short, in pushing for the MDGs at the UN millennium summit in 2000. &quot;It was a benign, optimistic time, before 9/11 and the Iraq war, when peace and harmony was not thought to be impossible. It was in that context that Kofi directed myself and others to get universal support of the whole membership&quot;, for the MDGs, says Malloch-Brown. Despite the promising international backdrop at the time, Malloch-Brown speaks of civil war within the development community, hence the focus in the MDGs on targets. With different and competing political and economic models, the MDGs did not specify how those goals they were to be achieved. &quot;It was all about outcomes in a world of division and confrontation,&quot; he says. Malloch-Brown believes a consensus now exists on what constitutes successful development, citing Cameron&apos;s golden thread, although he prefers the term common threads, to include transparency, rule of law and accountability of governments. Malloch-Brown asserts that as China and India develop  although not at such a breakneck speed as before  the world&apos;s poor people will be concentrated in an arc of weak or failing states, stretching from west Africa through Yemen to Afghanistan and Pakistan. In dealing with those countries, Malloch-Brown argues that it will not be sufficient to provide better healthcare and access to education or to provide a dynamic private sector to create jobs. &quot;You need accountable institutions, accountable to their own people, and the rule of law both to police that private sector and to prevent it from behaving monopolistically and in rent-seeking ways  but you also need that rule of law to stand up for the rights of the poor,&quot; he says. &quot;These are the threads which bring political leaders of very different political persuasions together. For 2015, we have an opportunity we didn&apos;t have in 2000 to capture that consensus.&quot; He acknowledges that any reference to democracy in a post-2015 development agenda would be a step too far for some, just as opposition from conservative religious groups, including the Vatican and some Islamic countries, led to a watering down of MDG three on gender equality. But Malloch-Brown believes  perhaps he is overoptimistic in this  that the need for successful development rather than any triumphal march of, in his words, &quot;Westminster-style democracy&quot; will ensure that the common threads will find their place in any development model. He cites the growing number of protests in China as a sign that top-down development, so seemingly successful in east Asia, has its limits. As for what should succeed the MDGs, he agrees with many commentators on the need to address inequality; a strengthening of MDG eight, which was vague on the responsibilities of rich countries; consolidating health, which is scattered across MDGs; and fleshing out MDG three on gender equality. &quot;What you want to avoid is a Christmas list of goals with every interest group racing to get in their goals,&quot; says Malloch-Brown. &quot;We know what&apos;s missing: infrastructure, jobs and definitely a stronger MDG eight about the obligations of those of us in richer countries.&quot;",

    "headline": "Desperate for cuts, is the Treasury now looking at higher education?", 
    "text": "Universities are flush with cash  for the precarious moment. The risk is that the Treasury will see higher education as a soft target for George Osborne&apos;s next wave of cuts in his disastrous policy of turn-of-the-screw public austerity. In the coming battle over even more cuts in public expenditure  when you are in the hole, keep digging  schools, health and defence are still to be &quot;protected&quot;. Social security has already been devastated. That does not leave much to cut. It is also difficult to see Vince Cable including higher education in his list of favoured infrastructure projects that must be funded, although in a nod to the rhetoric about the &quot;knowledge economy&quot; there may be a mini-reprieve for science. Universities are only (comparatively) well off because of the accidental effects of the government&apos;s botched reform of student fees and funding, which is plainly unsustainable. It is not their fault that, for all the talk of variable fees, the way these reforms were constructed means there is no incentive to charge below the cap. It is not their fault that, to ease Liberal Democrat consciences, the repayment regime is so loose that up to half of graduates will never pay back their loans in full  although the effect, of course, is to push up real (as opposed to nominal) public expenditure and bust the Treasury&apos;s model. But a coalition government scrabbling for votes from beer drinkers and petrol-heads is not going to offend another constituency by tightening up that repayment regime. So, according to its blinkered neo-liberal logic, there is no alternative to cutting direct public support for higher education still further. The problem is that support now is really only for two things: research (as measured by the forthcoming Research Excellence Framework) and high-cost or &quot;strategically important and vulnerable&quot; subjects, in other words, science, engineering and medicine. The rest is small beer  things like widening participation. Cutting that (and a few small but often vital initiatives) would not be enough to satisfy the Treasury&apos;s likely appetite for cuts. In short, cutting higher education spending would amount to slashing and burning our future  unless, of course, we want to continue to rely on a bloated and corrupt financial services sector and property/high street spending bubbles. Not so long ago there was talk of rebasing our economy on high-tech high-value exports. Goodbye to all that. In any case, the truth is that the &quot;prosperity&quot; of higher education, which a predatory and desperate Treasury is now eyeing, is largely an illusion. In practice higher education is in turmoil as institutions struggle to make sense of the insane combination of a &quot;command&quot; economy and a highly volatile student &quot;market&quot;. Nor are the most stressed institutions the &quot;usual suspects&quot;, the overblown post-1992 universities that ministers wish had never been born. Some of the &quot;top&quot; universities they wheedlingly patronise, are also suffering distress. But ministers, having flunked the obvious need for new legislation last year, have no intention of helping to sort out the mess of contradictory policies they have created. So far, there have been no Mid Staffordshire disasters in higher education. No university is running a staggering deficit papered over, as is the case with some famous teaching hospitals, by dodgy &quot;loans&quot; from the Department of Health. No students are being short-changed to meet financial targets, as patients have died. Even the most troubled universities  Cumbria a couple of years ago, London Metropolitan always  have continued to offer a good deal to students and sustain their research capacities. Only in a country as perverse as Coalition England would success like this be seen as evidence of over-generous funding and an invitation to cuts. Higher education in the UK is substantially underfunded by international standards. The east Asians, of course, are racing ahead. But the share of our GDP spent on the public funding of higher education is less than half that in Finland  and also below Germany and France. In the US, public investment is substantially higher  and is topped up by large amounts of private investment that are totally absent here. Overall public investment in universities is 20% below the OECD average, a great platform from which to launch the UK into the knowledge-rich future.

    "headline": "Bias in the fossil record", 
    "text": "There are a whole series of biases in the fossil record that affect which organisms were preserved and how, and thus affects how we as palaeontologists can investigate the life of these ancient worlds. The key of course is to understand and recognise these biases and account for them and how they affect things, and to make allowances as far as possible for their effects.  To become a fossil, the remains of an organism must not decay away to nothing, but instead be buried in some medium (mud, sand, ash) which generally (but not always) happens in water. This must lie undisturbed for long enough and under enough pressure from additional sediments for the material to become mineralised and turn into a fossil.  This immediately reveals some obvious biases. Things like mammals and snails have hard parts like a skeleton or shell that decay only very slowly and are rarely eaten and broken up by carnivores. As such these animals have a much better chance of fossilising than a slug or jellyfish. Such soft animals do preserve, but only under exceptional circumstances and so are rare. Environments such as rainforests teeming with life and in a hot and moist climate are also poor places for fossils to form as a carcass can decay quickly and not have time to be buried. Similarly a rocky mountaintop is a poor place for fossils to form with no fine sediments being laid down. A nice floodplain or stagnant lake or a coastal lagoon is great, however  not too much decay and lots of mud or sand swirling around in the water  and deserts too can be good.  The organisms themselves will have an effect too, and not just in terms of their anatomy or where they lived. Those with large populations that ranged far and wide would have many more individuals which could be buried and preserved, but a small group restricted to a small area less so. Similarly, those species that lasted for millions of years stand a better chance of hanging around for us to find compared to those that came and went in the blink of a geological eye. Time can also play a different role in making fossils unavailable. Earth&apos;s geological processes are mostly slow, but the tectonic plates do move over time and will eventually shift to the point that what is currently on the surface will be covered or destroyed. That means the older a fossil is (and we are talking about hundreds of millions of years), the more likely it is to have been shunted deep underground or lost forever and thus older fossils tend to be more rare. Finding things have biases too. We can&apos;t dig for fossils where no rocks of the right age are exposed, so while Montana and Mongolia are great, the rainforests of the Congo or the volcanic beds of Japan are useless (there&apos;s a reason pretty much every image of a palaeontologist in the field is in a desert or badlands  it&apos;s where the rocks are exposed). Even politics can play a part. Some intriguing fossils have recently turned up in North Korea, but I can&apos;t imagine a major research expedition heading out there any time soon.  Big fossils are easier to find than small ones so that helps, and the types of rock can have an effect too  very soft stuff that erodes quickly could mean that bones are destroyed before palaeontologists could find them, or that they are so damaged they can&apos;t be excavated and saved. Very hard stuff may take so long to work on that palaeontologists with limited budgets can&apos;t afford to work there. Also some rocks are commercially important and are excavated to be sold and may reveal fossils that palaeontologists could not normally afford to dig for, or simply process material in such huge volumes that something is bound to turn up.  In short, a group or species that was represented by huge numbers of individuals that lived for a long time, died out only recently, and hung around in deserts or near water, and was quite large and had lots of hard parts, we&apos;re likely to know well. A small, soft bodied animal from the deep ocean or middle of a rainforest and was alive only very briefly many hundreds of millions of years ago, we may never know about. In short, we have a great record of fossil deer, we have almost no fossil flatworms. Understanding these is obviously important for palaeontology. It would be too easy to look at the wealth of dinosaur fossils coming from (what were) deserts and conclude that these teemed with life when the truth is simply that they preserved many more skeletons than the forests.  While the fossil record is really pretty good surrounding the origins of birds, a great many specimens come from very few locations as we are reliant on the fossil-bearing rocks with the quality of preservation to retain the details of the fragile bones of small dinosaurs and early birds. It should not be a surprise then that there are also gaps in our knowledge precisely because so few areas preserve this kind of material in large numbers.  Still, recognising such issues is that first step in dealing with them and while clearly there is only so much that can be done, there are for example methods available to counter the effects of a limited amount of rocks to dig in on studies of the evolution of fossil groups. Still, such analyses do help ameliorate the problem and of course the ever increasing ranks of fossil finds provide new data to help fill in the gaps in our knowledge and give our studies greater power and scope. The fossil record is far from perfect, but at least many of the problems are well understood.",

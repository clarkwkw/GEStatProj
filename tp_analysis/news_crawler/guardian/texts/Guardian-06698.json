    "text": "A year on from the UN declaration of famine in Somalia, with a hunger summit planned for London this August, and continued unease over high and volatile food prices, we want to know what you think: why are hunger and food insecurity still such global problems, while other development goals show progress? As part of the debate, this month&apos;s Global development podcast will look at the food crisis in west Africa&apos;s Sahel region. The latest figures from aid agencies suggest that at least 18 million people are at risk of food shortages in Niger, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal, and one million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. Our podcast will feature Slanwa Gaston from Tearfund&apos;s Niger office, Denise Brown, head of the World Food Programme&apos;s Niger office, and Mariana Merelo Lobo, operations director at Action Against Hunger, which works in Chad, Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Nigeria. It is only two years since the region last experienced a food crisis. The aid response has been criticised for being too slow. Why does this keep happening? Have aid agencies got it right in the Sahel this year, by sounding the alarm early? Has disaster been averted? Are there lessons to be learned from elsewhere in the world, that can be applied in the region? And what are the long-term solutions to recurrent food insecurity? Share your questions, comments and experiences below. As always, we&apos;ll feed your thoughts into our podcast, and look for other ways to incorporate them into our content this week.",

    "text": "Mark Zuckerberg, the newly enriched Facebook founder, has updated his status to &quot;married&quot;.  Zuckerberg and 27-year-old Priscilla Chan wed at a small ceremony at his home in Palo Alto, California, on Saturday, capping a week during which the social network he founded listed on the share market for more than $100bn. Multi-billionaire Zuckerberg took his company public on the Nasdaq stock exchange in one of the most anticipated moves in Wall Street history on Friday. Chan graduated from medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, on Monday, the same day Zuckerberg turned 28. The couple met at Harvard and have been together for more than nine years. A company spokeswoman said Zuckerberg designed the ring  featuring &quot;a very simple ruby&quot;  himself. The ceremony took place in Zuckerberg&apos;s backyard before fewer than 100 guests, who all thought they were there to celebrate Chan&apos;s graduation. Tens of thousands of people &quot;liked&quot; his status change, which was accompanied by a photo of the couple in wedding attire.",

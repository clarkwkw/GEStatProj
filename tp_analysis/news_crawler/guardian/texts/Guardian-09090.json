    "text": "If you&apos;ve been invited for a university interview, congratulations  the battle is, in part, won. The next challenge is to meet academics face-to-face and prove that you are able to cope with the demands of your chosen course. Interviews are no mean feat, but if you do your preparation, you&apos;ll stand yourself in good stead, says Julian Skyrme, head of student recruitment at Manchester University. First, make sure you know exactly what to expect on the day. &quot;The university should send you information about what will happen when you arrive at interview  read this carefully,&quot; says Skyrme. &quot;Check if you will be asked to sit an assessment, or if there is anything you need to take with you. If you&apos;re not sure, call and ask.&quot; Also, speak to older students about how you can prepare, recommends Hira Nazir, a fourth-year dentistry student at Manchester University. &quot;If you don&apos;t know anyone studying your course, you can contact students through websites like the Student Room or the university&apos;s Facebook page.&quot; What you&apos;ll be asked varies according to degree choice, but it&apos;s all geared towards the same question  how suitable are you to study your subject at university level? &quot;It&apos;s essential that you read your personal statement through beforehand, as interviewers may wish to draw upon the topics you have raised,&quot; advises Dr Margaret Barnes-Davies, a graduate admissions tutor at the University of Leicester. &quot;Think why you have chosen a particular subject and university  read about the course online, and pay attention to the teaching styles offered.&quot; Candidates for particularly competitive subjects may also face academic questions. Nazir recalls being asked several specific dentistry questions. &quot;I was asked about cross-contamination control  how would I reduce the risk of infection? And I was given a scenario  I had to imagine I was out in town on a Friday night. Of the people I would see there, I was asked to say who was mostly likely to end up in my surgery the next morning.&quot; Tutors will be listening for analytical abilities and intellectual flexibility, says Skyrme. &quot;They want to see that you&apos;ve done wider reading beyond A-levels and that you are able to cope with new ideas. &quot;An English candidate might be asked what a feminist would think of a particular book, for example. There won&apos;t always be a right or wrong answer.&quot; The key to preparing well is practice, which means plenty of mock interviews  with teachers, classmates or whoever is on hand. Valeed Ghafoor, a fourth-year medical student, remembers recruiting family members to act as interviewers. &quot;Even though they didn&apos;t know the subject well, they could still comment on my body language and the way I spoke. Although the academic element is very important, you also need to come across as someone who is intelligent, calm, and enjoys their subject.&quot;",

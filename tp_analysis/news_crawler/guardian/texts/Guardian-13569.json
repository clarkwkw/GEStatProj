    "text": "There are no plans to privatise or sell any part of Sussex University (Sussex University students stand up against privatisation, 11 March). Rather, we are proposing to work with private-sector partners to improve how we run our facilities and to enable our catering and conference services to grow in a way that matches our academic ambitions. With all our students, home and overseas, now paying substantial fees to attend our university, it is essential that we deliver quality services. But we are certainly not doing so at the expense of our current staff in these services, all of whom will be able to transfer to new employers on their existing terms and conditions, and with future pension provision which we are seeking to ensure is fair and reasonable. Sussex is a world-class university, with a growing reputation and has a very special character as part of the community of Brighton and Hove. The right to peaceful protest is fully respected by the university, but you are right to note that the occupation involves &quot;dozens&quot; of students  out of a student body of 13,000.John DuffyRegistrar and secretary, University of Sussex",

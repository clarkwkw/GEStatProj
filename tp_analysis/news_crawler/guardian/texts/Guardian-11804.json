    "text": "Redundancy was a career changer for Kate Paterson, an architect in a large Manchester practice, who lost her job when the recession hit the property market. She took her redundancy cheque, a loan and her savings to invest in a one-year full-time MBA course at Lancaster University Management School. It was a big risk but two years later she is working as a consultant for Rural Solutions, the rural development and planning specialist. &quot;It&apos;s a perfect way to combine my knowledge of architecture and the consultancy skills I gained on the course. The work is very creative and I get access to beautiful rural and historic sites,&quot; she says. An unexpected bonus of the MBA course was winning a scholarship to study for an extra three months at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland. Networking was an important part of the programme at Lancaster and because of her architecture background, she was introduced to the managing director of Rural Solutions, himself a graduate of the school, and it led to a job offer. &quot;Before I was made redundant I was just going through the motions,&quot; Paterson says. &quot;I was in my mid 30s, earning money to pay the mortgage and thought I had found my niche. I was in a bit of a rut, looking back. With the MBA, the world started to open up for me again.&quot;",

But Apple will be the most interesting company to watch here. Its ultimate decision about open versus proprietary map data will have big ripple effects for app developers.   Microsoft is a patron of OpenStreetMap, which remains an independent foundation. New Wikipedia app for iOS (and an update for our Android App) &gt;&gt; Wikimedia blog Cutting to the interesting bit of this mobile application:   Previous versions of our application used Google Maps for the nearby view. This has now been replaced with OpenStreetMap - an open and free source of Map Data that has been referred to as &apos;Wikipedia for Maps.&apos; This closely aligns with our goal of making knowledge available in a free and open manner to everyone. This also means we no longer have to use proprietary Google APIs in our code, which helps it run on the millions of cheap Android handsets that are purely open source and do not have the proprietary Google applications.   Wikipedia on the desktop already appears not to use Google Maps. Education in Peru: Error message &gt;&gt; The Economist One Laptop Per Child arrived in Peru. How well did it fare?   An evaluation of the laptop programme by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) found that the children receiving the computers did not show any improvement in maths or reading. Nor did it find evidence that access to a laptop increased motivation, or time devoted to homework or reading. The report applauded the government for providing much-needed hardware: less than a quarter of Peruvian households had a computer in 2010. But it now needs to improve teacher-training and the curriculum, said Julian Cristia of the IDB. Above all, the classroom environment needs to change.  The Mystery of the Flying Laptop &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com Matt Richtel tries to find out why the US&apos;s TSA insists on laptops being scanned separately but not tablets:   Could it be because laptops, unlike tablet computers, have an easily removable battery compartment and hard drive that could be used to hide homemade bombs? But some netbooks and ultrabooks have similar compartments, and they don&apos;t require separate screening. Strike two.  Perhaps, I thought, it&apos;s because the circuitry of a laptop can be replaced with a device to send an electromagnetic signal to jam an airplane&apos;s controls at takeoff or landing. But, as I soon learned, the same circuitry could be embedded just as easily in phones, watches or game players, all of which stay in the bag.  I was starting to feel like a Monty Python character, riding a pretend horse, clomping my coconut halves together to simulate the sound of horse hooves. A comical quest for a mythical grail.

    "text": "As a woman hell-bent on promoting cycling as a desirable lifestyle choice, I am always keen to hear about exciting new ladies&apos; bikes. Five years ago, the choice for a female commuter like me was limited to uninspiring hybrids or expensive traditional bikes. This year, however, there are a gaggle of young, hip, independent bikes giving the bigger brands a run for their money. I set out to test-ride three of these bikes to see if function measured up to form. Bobbin Bicycles: Bobbin Birdie     The Bobbin Birdie    How does it look?Call me superficial, but I&apos;m a sucker for a nice-looking bike and this Dutch-style model with sky blue sweeping frame instantly lifted my mood. The brown saddle and handlebar grips, along with the gum-wall tires, give it a classic feel, but the brightly-coloured paintwork (it also comes in bright yellow and bright red) add a modern twist. And with Florence Welch as a customer, you can be assured this brand has the cool factor. How does it feel?The riding position is the traditional &quot;sit up and beg&quot;. It may take a little getting used to if you&apos;ve not tried it before but I personally find it the most stable, safe and comfortable position for day-to-day cycling. You exert much less energy and therefore get less sweaty, clothes don&apos;t ride up your back and the higher position makes you more visible to traffic. Stairs test:All bikes get hoiked up to my office, three floors up. The Birdie was surprisingly light for the type of bike it is, weighing in at 14kg. I made it to the top without stopping but was a little puffed out. Where do I put my stuff?A good solid back-rack accommodated my pannier very well and there was ample space at the front to attach a basket. Value for money and verdict:A great price at 380. Good quality gears (three speed Sturmey Archer hub). The pedals are a little cheap and there were slight chips in paintwork but if you want a comfy commuter with character and you&apos;re not to bothered about speed, I would highly recommend the Bobbin Birdie. Crme Cycles: Cafracer Doppio Lady     The Cafracer Doppio Lady    How does it look?This is a beautiful bicycle. The quality of the parts and attention to detail are exquisite: The steel &quot;mixte&quot; frame (a ladies&apos; frame that has the same geometry as a road bike but with a lower step-through) cream Schwalbe tires, hammered alloy mudguards and Brooks saddle and handlebar grips give it a real wow factor. It comes in a sublime array of muted colours from champagne to turquoise. How does it feel?The semi-upright position and the seven-speed Shimano gear hub give you the option to go at a leisurely pace or pick up some serious speed. So, as the name suggests, you really can race from cafe to cafe. Stairs test:Heavy. I was puffed out getting it up to my office. This may not be the most practical option if you need to lug it up to a flat. Where do I put my stuff?This bike is modelled on hand-built Porteur bikes (a type of cargo bike) from the 1950s and 60s, so has a rack on the front that can take 10kg. However, you&apos;d need to have some bungee straps to keep your belongings stable. Value for money and verdict:At 830 this is not a recession-friendly bicycle and may be way out of many people&apos;s budgets. It is beautifully made and the parts are excellent quality, but it&apos;s a little flashy for my tastes. Charge Bikes: The Hob 3     The Hob 3    How does it look?Another Mixte frame but a more tomboyish bike than the Crme. A little lacking in character for me but a streamlined elegance, nonetheless and the glitter green paintwork is a nice touch. How does it feel?For a Pashley-riding pootler like me, the forward-leaning riding position was a shock to the system. The handlebar stem is at a fixed height so you need to be sure it&apos;s the right fit for you before you buy. At first I felt unsafe and out of my comfort zone but, after 20 minutes racing around, I enjoyed the speed it allowed me and was reluctant to hand it back. Stairs test:It was light as a feather, so I was practically jogging up the stairs. Where do I put my stuff?There is no basket or rack but it has mounting brackets for a rear rack. Value for money and verdict:Price-wise it sits somewhere between the Bobbin and the Crme at 580. This is a great bike for the zippy commuter who covers of lot of miles and travels light. Everything about the bike makes you want to go fast, so it&apos;s not a good option for the nervous cyclist or beginner.  Caz Nicklin is founder of Cyclechic.co.uk",

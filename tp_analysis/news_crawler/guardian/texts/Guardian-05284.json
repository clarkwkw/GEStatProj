This video is by Sean Ohlenkamp and his wife, Lisa, with the help of 27 volunteers who lovingly shelved and reshelved books all night, every night, for the making of this film. Mr Ohlenkamp is on facebook and twitter @ohkamp  The original music is composed and performed by Toronto-based Grayson Matthews, which can be found on twitter @GraysonMatthews The action takes place at Type Books in Toronto, Canada, a bookstore that I would surely visit daily if only it was 2000 miles closer.

    "text": "Google has embarked on a project to map towpaths in England and Wales, as part of a plan to get more people on to rivers and canals. Later this year, Google Maps will be updated to enable users to plan journeys that include bridges, locks and the 2,000 miles of canal and river paths across England and Wales. The project is being launched today with the Canal and River Trust, which begins its stewardship of the nation&apos;s waterways next month. It takes over from British Waterways and the Waterways Trust in England and Wales to become responsible for the nation&apos;s third largest collection of listed structures, as well hundreds of important wildlife habitats. Tony Hales, the chairman of the trust, said: &quot;We are delighted that these exciting partners have come on board as we launch. This is a huge vote of confidence in the Canal and River Trust and recognition of the important role it will play as the guardian of one of the nation&apos;s environmental treasures.&quot; Ed Parsons, a geospatial technologist at Google UK, said of the project: &quot;Canal towpaths offer green routes through our towns and cities, and by working with the Canal and River Trust we&apos;re adding towpaths to Google Maps and encouraging people to discover their local waterway.&quot;",

    "text": "As we enter the REF (Research Excellence Framework) submission year our minds will become ever more focused on research, with words like &quot;impact&quot; and &quot;value&quot; dominating discussions. However, underlying it all will be concerns about the outcomes, and the implications this will have on research funding. The 1994 Group has highlighted the fact that there have been a number of recent funding decisions made on the basis of the amount of research already taking place within an institution or department  the idea that a high concentration of academics, or critical mass, is necessary for excellent research. So what is so critical about mass? Critical mass seems to be based on the assumption that there is a minimum amount of research required to make a department effective and a certain concentration that results in the best research. Supporters also argue that critical mass inevitably produces economies of scale. There are, however, a number of false assumptions in this argument. Firstly, there are many subjects and disciplines where academics working in small groups or on their own produce excellent research. While this may be particularly true of arts and humanities research, it certainly isn&apos;t exclusive to these disciplines. The Medical Research Council&apos;s Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge is often cited as an example for those who believe that small group size is beautiful; they aim for groups in the lab of between five to eight, yet they have hosted nine Nobel prize winners since 1958. And who&apos;s to say that one person with two brains can&apos;t create their own critical mass. Secondly, the area where the argument for critical mass holds most weight is in those disciplines where you need big pieces of kit. But does every university or department need a high performance computer? The key question is, even in the cases where there is an argument for critical mass, does it need to be within one institution? Modern research is very collaborative, taking place across institutions and countries. In recent years we have seen a rise in research networks and partnerships  whether N8 in the UK or international subject or institutional networks such as Coimbra or Universitas 21  often supported by equipment sharing. So even where mass can be important it is now increasingly possible to achieve this even in small departments or institutions. In this new environment, critical mass is less about the number of bodies in a building, and more about the ability to draw on regional, international and cross-disciplinary networks. There is a strong argument that part of the reason that the UK has been so successful in delivering research excellence is because of its diverse ecosystem of institutions. So while there will be benefits of having a large department in one institution there will also be different benefits in having a group or network of institutions working together to deliver a research project. We can&apos;t predict the benefits of the different ways of delivering research and we should not try to create a single homogenised model. By recognising the importance of research networks in funding allocations  and joint REF submissions  we would encourage a collaborative approach. Thirdly, it is worth asking the question: can a department ever be too big? If critical mass implies the benefits of economies of scale, then logic would suggest that there is a tipping point at which the benefits are lost: larger labs can be harder to manage and inefficiencies could start to creep in. There is the possibility of larger labs slipping into &quot;group think&quot; and departments may be more susceptible to silo effects  whereas small departments can encourage the cross-fertilisation of ideas between disciplines. It is also important to make the distinction between critical mass and research intensity. As our 2011 report noted &quot;Research intensive institutions contribute most highly to national research excellence when funding concentrates according to merit. Where funding follows excellence, and thus concentrates naturally at a certain level, there are signs that research institutions make the largest contributions to national research excellence.&quot; The key word here is &quot;naturally&quot;. It is important to fund excellence, and this will result in a certain amount of concentration, but the driver for funding should be excellence rather than scale. So while the idea of critical mass is a useful tool it should not become our master.

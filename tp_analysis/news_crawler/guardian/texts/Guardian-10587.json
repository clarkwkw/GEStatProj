    "text": "There is a simple way to think about the complex energy policy decisions made today: it is a 200bn bet on the UK&apos;s energy future. What&apos;s more, the money on the table belongs to you. Win or lose, every electricity and gas customer will pick up the tab for this wager for decades to come. In such a high-rolling game, you would have hoped for cool heads. Instead, &quot;unholy war&quot; was waged behind the Westminster scenes, a senior participant told me. Worse, the boiling row within the coalition was driven as much by ideology and party politics as cold, hard facts. In fact, the opposing sides had &quot;different facts&quot;, the source said. All sides agreed on one thing at least. The problem the much-delayed energy bill seeks to solve is a fiendish one. It requires predicting the future and is not so much a dilemma as a trilemma. The solution must keep the lights on while simultaneously preventing energy bill payers from being fleeced and tackling the ever-growing dangers of climate change. Furthermore, we are not starting from a strong position. Two decades of under-investment in our energy infrastructure has left a dirty and decaying system. Action was unavoidable, meaning the question was not will energy bills go up, but by how much? The more adventurous punters among may be happy that chancellor George Osborne refused to curb his new dash for gas, spiced as that prospect is by the possibility of a shale gas revolution in the UK. Gas prices will plummet, say fracking supporters, so why waste so much money on renewable energy? Never mind that relying on gas puts the nation on the rollercoaster ride of fossil fuel geopolitics. The fact, for example, that a half of the UK&apos;s gas imports come through the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran has threatened to close, just adds to the excitement. With risky bets, of course, the odds are long. No one outside the fracking industry thinks shale gas is a silver bullet for the UK&apos;s energy trilemma. Nor is anyone placing serious money on European gas prices declining, not least because demand for the fuel is rising so fast elsewhere in the world. The alternative wager, backed by the Liberal Democrats, was a more diverse flutter - a bit of gas, renewable energy and nuclear. But energy secretary Ed Davey was out-muscled by Osborne and only a bit of the nation&apos;s stake money is backing this bet. The lack of full backing means that, despite the green sector being one of the few growing parts of the UK&apos;s torpid economy, those jobs are now more likely to go abroad. Where does this leave us? Given that keeping the lights on is non-negotiable and that cutting carbon emissions is a legal requirement, the critical factor is cost. At this point, the complexity of the energy bill starts to make the financial engineering that crashed the economy look like primary school arithmetic. In the arcane algebra of contracts-for-difference, capacity mechanisms and carbon floor prices, there are plenty of hiding places for jackpot wins for energy companies at their customers expense. Ministers are effectively negotiating with one company for the nuclear power it believes is needed soon  scarcely the scenario to deliver a bargain for energy bill payers. Those building new gas plants are demanding payments too, in case carbon targets mean the plants can only run part-time. Of course, renewable energy providers are also arguing hard for their subsidies. But they have a trump card: while the cost of gas and nuclear power is on an upward trend, the cost of green energy and its subsidies is already falling. The greatest failing of the new energy policy is the woeful underplaying of the cheapest option of all: energy efficiency. Almost all the incentives are aimed at producing more power, none at reducing the demand. Why is the UK planning for an increase in electricity demand of up to two-thirds in 2050, when Europe&apos;s manufacturing powerhouse, Germany, is planning for a cut of a quarter? As a nation we have now pretty much paid our money and taken our choice. The coalition has staked a good bit of our money on Osborne&apos;s bet that international gas prices won&apos;t spike and that the UK&apos;s shale gas hype bubble won&apos;t burst, meaning relatively cheap, clean wind power can be passed up without consequence. We still have a bit on the plan that emphasises exploiting the renewable resources on our doorstep, creating a secure and sustainable energy system. But overall, in the great energy gamble, we&apos;ve chosen a long odds bet rather than back the favourite and we will pay the price.",

    "text": "This is an idyllic season for satellite spotters in Britain. The Sun is sufficiently far north of the equator that the Earth&apos;s shadow overhead is shallow enough for satellites in low Earth orbit to be illuminated, and therefore visible, even in the middle of the night. There is still time to catch the ISS before its latest series of spectacular evening passes ends next week. Like most satellites, the ISS was launched in an easterly direction. A velocity of 27,400 kph (17,030 mph) is needed to reach orbit and by being launched eastwards a satellite gains some of this from the Earth&apos;s spin. That advantage amounts to 1,670 kph at the Earth&apos;s equator and 1,160 kph at Baikonur from which the first ISS module was launched in 1998. This is the prime reason very few satellites take a pronounced westwards path across our sky. Launching into an orbit over the poles, though, means a satellite can view the Earth&apos;s entire surface. Picking an orbital inclination to the equator of about 98 has the advantage that the orbit remains fixed in space with respect to the Sun and lies overhead at the same time each day. One of the most conspicuous of these so-called Sun-synchronous satellites is Europe&apos;s large Envisat whose northbound orbit lies over Britain at about 22:30 BST. Sadly, contact was lost with Envisat on 8 April but it is too soon to say whether its observation mission of has ended after 10 years.",

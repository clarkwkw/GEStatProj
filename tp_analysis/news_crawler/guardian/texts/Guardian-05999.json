    "text": "Description A parasitic barnacle Ecology A female larva of this species attaches itself to a crab and grows branching routes through the unfortunate host. She produces a mass of eggs in her body below the crab&apos;s abdomen (see picture), which are fertilised by male larvae (the males have no adult stage). The host crab is prevented from moulting by the parasite and so eventually is encrusted with other animals. The parasite also feminises male crabs. The crab (male or female) cares for the parasite&apos;s eggs as if they were its own. Distribution Widely distributed.  Name the other species by clicking on the links on the right-hand side or the previous and next buttons at the top of the page",

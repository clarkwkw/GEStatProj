    "text": "What a wonderful gift from Michael Moritz, and what an irony that, if his father fled to Britain today, he might well  if your report is accurate  be excluded from his son&apos;s generosity (Tycoon gives 75m for Oxford&apos;s poorest students, 12 July). Many young people who come to the UK as asylum seekers are not granted Iindefinite, but discretionary, leave to remain. If offered a place at university, they must pay overseas student fees  in Oxford&apos;s case, more than 13,000 a year  but they are excluded from the government-backed loan that would cover their (hopefully, reduced) tuition fees. Only, under current regulations, with a complete fee waiver and a large contribution towards living costs can most young people with DLR study at Oxford or any other English university. Without generosity on this scale, the admirable goal of Oxford&apos;s vice-chancellor, of &quot;ensuring that all barriers  real or perceived  are removed from students&apos; choices&quot;, cannot be achieved.Nicholas SagovskyLondon  As an Oxford graduate who has taught for 30 years in the state sector, one of my roles is to encourage more of our pupils to aim high and apply for Oxbridge. The bursary is a magnanimous gesture that will certainly help to alleviate the financial concerns of some pupils. The issue for many schools is provision for those students with real academic potential. Whereas many private schools are able to teach small groups, most state schools struggle with thinly spread resources. We run extra classes for talented pupils where we can, but teachers are pulled in many directions (especially with pressures to improve more mundane &quot;headline&quot; results). As well as its excellent summer schools, perhaps Oxford could do more in terms of outreach to schools, deploying specialist staff to run the booster classes that schools simply do not have the capacity to set up.Jon MeierSt Albans, Hertfordshire",

    "text": "Protoanguilla palau is an odd new species of small, eel-like fish discovered from a fringing-reef cave in the western Pacific Ocean in the Republic of Palau. The fish differs from all previously known eels in a number of important respects including a disproportionately large head, a short and compressed body, unusual collar-like gill openings and caudal fin rays that are only slightly produced. It is so distinct that it has been assigned to a new genus and new family, Protoanguillidae. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis based on numerous osteological characters and whole mitogenome sequences suggest that P.palau is sister to all other living Angulliformes, the true eels. If this relationship is corroborated then the split between these lineages dates approximately to the early Mesozoic, 200m years ago. The first fossil eels show up in the Cretaceous about 100m years ago, but mitochondrial gene sequences place the divergence of P.palau and the origin of true eels much earlier. The species retains at least half a dozen complex anatomical structures that have been lost or modified in all other living true eels and has thus been hailed as a &quot;living fossil&quot; suggesting that the species is conservative in many of its features compared to most of the 819 species in its sister lineage. Like other &quot;living fossils&quot;  such as horseshoe crabs, gingko trees, coelocanths, or lepidotrichid bristletail insects  it putatively opens a window on the past, giving us the opportunity to examine a living species that looks more like its ancestor than any of its relatives. The new species was described by an international team led by Dr G David Johnson of the Smithsonian Institution&apos;s National Museum of Natural History and including collaborators from Kitasato University, Iwate, Japan, the Southern Marine Laboratory in Koror, Palau, and the Natural History Museum and Institute in Chiba, Japan. Like all exciting discoveries, the new fish raises as many questions as it answers. Although larvae of P.palau are not yet known, the authors predict, based on eels and related fish, that they will be flat, transparent, ribbon-like leptocephali that typically drift for long periods, two to 10 months. Given this planktonic early life, the authors reason that the geographic distribution of this remarkable eel will ultimately prove to be much wider than Palau. There can be no doubt that its lineage had a different distribution for much of its existence since the Palau-Kyushu Ridge did not form until 60-70m years ago.",

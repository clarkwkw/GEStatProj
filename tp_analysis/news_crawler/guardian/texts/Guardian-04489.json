    "text": "Playing as fireman Tom Riley, Resistance: Burning Skies pitches players into a no-surprises mission to rescue his family in the midst of an alien invasion. &quot;No surprises&quot; seems to be the defining trait of this first-person shooter (FPS), as it proves capable but largely uneventful, delivering nothing gamers won&apos;t have experienced better elsewhere. What it does best is show how much potential the Vita has in delivering a portable shooter. Twin thumbsticks give a full range of movement, while icons for grenades, secondary fire options and your ever-present axe are located on the touchscreen, in easy reach of the player&apos;s thumb. Other controls prove less adept, such as activating sprint by tapping the rear pad, but there&apos;s nothing truly broken in the mechanical workings of the game. Weapon variety is decent, with some imaginative alien tech thrown in, but underwhelming compared to the PS3&apos;s Resistance entries. Unfortunately, all these positive elements are restricted by world design that is inherently linear. Taking gamers on a by-the-numbers romp through the devastated east coast of America, the occasional set pieces offer sensation but little substance, no alternate routes and an almost depressingly small window for tactical play. An uninspiring online option offers a serviceable assortment of multiplayer modes but, like much of the game, they seem merely to be ticking boxes rather than something to be excited by. Resistance: Burning Skies is by no means bad, but in being the premiere FPS on Vita, it should have reached or exceeded expectations. Instead, what might have been exceptional remains mediocre.",

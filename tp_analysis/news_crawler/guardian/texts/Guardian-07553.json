    "text": "Google is to buy the travel guidebooks brand Frommer&apos;s as the internet company ramps up its bid to become the premier destination for local reviews and listings online. Google will pay an undisclosed sum for the Frommer&apos;s brand, which launched in 1957 when Arthur Frommer published his &apos;Europe on $5 a day&apos; guidebook. The deal gives Google a vast and growing archive of digital reviews for its local listings, maps and mobile applications. It comes nearly a year after Google bought Zagat Survey, the restaurant review and ratings service. Google said the Frommer&apos;s purchase  which includes more than 300 guidebooks  would complement its aim to provide &quot;a review for every relevant place in the world&quot;. The future of Frommer&apos;s print titles is understood to be safe in the near term, but could be made online-only as the brand is merged with Zagat inside Google. &quot;The Frommer&apos;s team and the quality and scope of their content will be a great addition to the Zagat team. We can&apos;t wait to start working with them on our goal to provide a review for every relevant place in the world,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Google. Frommer&apos;s owner John Wiley &amp; Sons announced the deal on Monday. The publishing group said Frommer&apos;s no longer aligned with its business strategy and the sale was part of plans to offload several other brands, including Webster&apos;s New World and CliffsNotes. Shares in John Wiley &amp; Sons were down 0.27%, at $47.46 a share, in midday trading on the New York stock exchange. Google&apos;s stock was up almost 2%, to $654 a share, on the Nasdaq after the deal was announced.",

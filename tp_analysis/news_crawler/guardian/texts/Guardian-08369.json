    "text": "One of the best gauges of cycling&apos;s ever-increasing popularity is the explosion of &quot;commuter&quot; clothing ranges, designed to be functional both on and off the bike. My instinctive reaction is often sceptical: if I&apos;m riding quickly or a long distance, nothing beats cycling gear, but there&apos;s no reason why other trips can&apos;t be tackled in ordinary clothes. There&apos;s nothing specifically bike-unfriendly about, say, a pair of jeans. This attitude has been reinforced by some unexceptional early examples of the genre. A couple of years ago I was cautiously positive about the Bspoke range of in-the office/on-the-bike clothes. In retrospect I don&apos;t think moleskin trousers with a generously cut, MC Hammer-style gusset are the future. But equally, I&apos;ve been proved wrong. One of the most-worn items in my cycling wardrobe is a pair of ultra-light, sleek and supremely versatile shorts by Surface, the clothing arm of the Charge bikes empire, equally at home in the saddle, on the beach or mooching round the house. I&apos;ve been stopped several times at traffic lights by riders asking where to buy them. This isn&apos;t the sort of thing that usually happens to me. After that long introduction, down to business. I&apos;ve been trying out examples from two new ranges which offer something of a contrast, not least in origin. One is the Commuter series from Levi&apos;s, the clothing behemoth&apos;s entry into the cycling world.  The other comes from Vulpine, a tiny venture set up by a cycling-mad couple who left their jobs to pursue their dream. It&apos;s fair to say that this difference shows. The two items I tried from Levi&apos;s bear the hallmarks of things designed by a committee given, from on high, the brief: &quot;This cycling stuff seems quite trendy, how can we get on board?&quot; Inevitably, the range&apos;s website shows a very cool model holding up a narrow-handlebarred fixie, albeit with front and back brakes, probably on the advice of the company lawyers.      Trousers from the Levi's Commuter series    The two most obvious innovations on the jeans I tried out were on the same lines: an extra loop of fabric on the rear waistband from which to hang the ubiquitous mini-Kryptonite lock, and reflective seams on the inside, for rolling the trouser up the calf in the approved courier-style fashion. The slightly stiff, crinkly fabric is supposedly more resistant to water, stains and odours, but to me mainly felt a bit hot. I was even less impressed with the grey long-sleeved shirt, which seemed equally boil-in-the-bag despite a breathable mesh strip at the top of the back, hidden with a neat seam, and small mesh patches under the arms. I think it&apos;s wonderful that cycling is now seen as sufficiently aspirational for such a vast company to want to hitch itself to the bandwagon. I&apos;m just not hugely enthusiastic about the clothes. Worse still, the Commuter series is currently a men&apos;s range only. Maybe the Levi&apos;s focus groups forgot to mention that women also ride bikes. By contrast the Vulpine range is clearly a labour of love. Even the items I was less keen on were well thought out and beautifully made.     The Vulpine cotton rain jacket    The star was a lightweight cotton waterproof jacket which managed the near-unique trick of being both fairly impermeable to water but reasonably breathable. Even if you don&apos;t like the slim, almost militaristic styling  I think it works very well  you can appreciate details like a neat bum-guarding flap, tucked out of sight when not in use with a magnet, and the ultra-cosy rings of delicate fleece around the inner cuffs. Vulpine also do a thicker softshell jacket, which again looks well-made, even though the one I was sent ended up being too big to try out properly. I even  and these are words I never anticipated typing  liked the gilet, a clothing item I&apos;ve previously scorned. Slim-fitting and lightweight it makes short work of chilly mornings and takes almost no space in a bag. The merino button jerseys and crew-neck T-shirts were slightly less to my taste, if undeniably sleek and comfy. I found them a bit too snug to resemble something you might wear to work, unless maybe you work in a gym. There is, of course, a catch. The Levi&apos;s range isn&apos;t cheap, but 80 for a posh pair of jeans is not so exceptional these days. The Vulpine range is that bit more: 195 for the rain jacket, for example.  It&apos;s almost pointless rehashing the arguments over such prices. At one extreme some ascetics affirm a pair of sellotaped bin bags provide sufficient rain protection and it is immoral to pay more; others think 200 is worth it for a well-made, comfy jacket which will get a number of years&apos; use.  The more relevant lesson, I&apos;d argue, is this: the more a company appears to genuinely love and be obsessed by cycling, the better their cycling gear.",

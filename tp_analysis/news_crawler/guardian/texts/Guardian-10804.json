    "text": "Wii U&apos;s brisk first-weekend release schedule includes ZombiU, the gritty, relentlessly dark game of survival and living death in destroyed London and New Super Mario Bros U, bringing HD beauty to bear on Nintendo&apos;s mascot, with an emphasis on madcap co-op play for up to five players. Also out for Wii U are Assassin&apos;s Creed III, Batman: Arkham City, Armoured Edition, Call Of Duty: Black Ops II, FIFA 13, Skylanders Giants, Darksiders II, Mass Effect 3 Special Edition and most of this year&apos;s blockbusters, fleetingly reworked to include a sop to the touch screen. Owners of traditional consoles will have to make do with Rise Of The Guardians: The Video Game (Xbox, PS3, Wii, DS, 3DS, Wii U), based on the 3D Christmas film that shares its name and Zone Of The Enders HD Collection (Xbox, PS3), which comes with a demo of the ludicrously titled Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.",

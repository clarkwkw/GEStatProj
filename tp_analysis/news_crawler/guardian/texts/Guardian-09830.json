    "text": "With the Department for International Development&apos;s spending record coming under increasingly intense scrutiny of late, UK aid has been making headlines. The long-standing debate about who benefits from the ringfenced British aid budget not to mention who should has been reinvigorated by a variety of considerations, ranging from the amount of money spent through consultants, and channelled through the EU, to concern about whether the UK should give aid to the Rwandan government. To discuss these issues, the Guardian&apos;s Hugh Muir is joined in the studio by Deborah Doane, director of the World Development Movement, Owen Barder, director for Europe at the Centre for Global Development, and Joe Powell, senior policy and advocacy manager at the campaign group ONE. Also contributing their thoughts are Firoze Manji, former editor-in-chief of Pambazuka News and Pambazuka Press, and Jonathan Glennie, a researcher at the Overseas Development Institute, based in Colombia.  Relive some of the debates on our Talk point",

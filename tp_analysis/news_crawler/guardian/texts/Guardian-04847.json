    "text": "   Daniela Leyton, Rio+20 Photograph: Mattia Cabitza for the Guardian    Sustainability is anything that overcomes the capitalism trap, our playing with life, relationships, nature and all of its cycles, the pretext for policies of state intervention, and the threat to our social fabric. Sustainability empowers human development in harmonic synergy with nature, and discards our imperative need for consumption and material accumulation. Sustainability promotes co-operation instead of competition, and redistribution based on equality; it rescues diversity and different cultures, and puts forward all the critical elements for a frontal attack against all structural violence. In other words, it overcomes power addiction and global degeneration, and instead rediscovers alternative forms of generative power and love. Over the past 20 years, I have seen hopeful changes and learned lessons from our deep need to consider ourselves as one with Mother Earth, and from our indigenous brothers and sisters who have shown us all the potential that is rooted in cultural diversity and the importance of having one&apos;s own land to live in, side by side with Mother Nature. I&apos;ve also been moved by a constant and continuous call to attention by the entire Latin American region, where people are becoming aware and questioning extractive models and hypocritical speeches by our leaders, and are claiming their sovereignty and struggle for a dignified life by fearlessly naming and shaming transnational political traps that are done in the name of development but only result in roads, mining exploitation, oil extraction, pollution, genetically modified monocultures, and bigger-than-life infrastructure projects that go against living in harmony with nature. Now is the time to abandon lukewarm and perverse rhetoric that only seeks to serve the capitalist evil. We need to break away from capitalist-driven interactions, exploitation of natural resources and the cycles of nature. We need to recognise we have a human right to fair access to vital natural resources. We need to respect and understand the traditional lifestyles of all people and redefine the quality of life in our cities, far from the desperate dynamics of consumerism and the pursuit of excessive growth that ignores the tolerance limits of our depleted and living Mother Earth. I&apos;m hoping that any agreement struck at this meeting will be consistent with the urgent needs of our humanity. I hope it succeeds where the 1992 conference failed, and in particular seeks to end the fallacy of a so-called green economy that promotes green investment but is nothing less than a perverse market instrument that benefits large corporations, the extractive industry and polluters, violates human rights, and ignores any social and environmental justice.",

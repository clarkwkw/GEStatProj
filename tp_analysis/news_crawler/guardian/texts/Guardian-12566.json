    "text": "If you&apos;re hoping to start university in the autumn, you might well be feeling anxious about student finances. The cost of doing a degree suddenly soared when tuition fees increased to as much as 9k for students starting university last autumn. So these days, students need to get a grip on their finances as quickly as possible. From finding the right bank for your student account to planning how much part-time work you&apos;ll need to take during term time, there&apos;s plenty to consider before starting your course. You&apos;ll need to understand how tuition fee and maintenance loans work, and how much you end up paying back once you&apos;ve graduated. As part of the National Student Money week, we&apos;ve brought together student experts and the National Association of Student Money Advisers (Nasma) to answer your questions. Start posting them in the comments section now, and join in the discussion between 1-3pm on Thursday. The panel Rob Ellis is a financial information and support advisor at Swansea University. He also is also Welsh coordinator for Nasma. Nichola Malton is the assessing services manager for Student Finance England (SFE).

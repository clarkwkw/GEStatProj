    "text": "The European commission has announced an increase in funding to the Sahel by 40m (32.2m) as the food crisis is set to peak in the coming weeks putting 18 million people at risk from hunger. The move  bringing EU funding to combat the food crisis to 337m  came as the commission hosted a high-level meeting to launch a new partnership on strengthening the long-term resilience of the Sahel belt, stretching from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. The initiative, called Agir Sahel (Alliance Globale pour l&apos;Initiative Resilience), seeks to ensure that the people in the Sahel can better cope with future droughts by focusing on food security and agriculture. The 40m proposed would go towards feeding programmes for children and distribution of food to the poorest households. Where food is still available on local markets, the funding will be used to distribute money to people to buy food. Part of this funding will provide food, water, healthcare and shelter for the estimated 400,000 Malians displaced by conflict, which has exarcerbated the crisis.           In recent weeks, relief agencies have stepped up appeals for emergency funding and announced extra cash for the Sahel with the onset of the &quot;lean season&quot;, when conditions are at their harshest before the next harvest in October. Unicef, the UN agency for children, last week doubled its appeal for funds to 153m. The Department for International Development (DfID) and the USAid agency have also increased money for the region. &quot;This funding is about saving lives in an emergency. It is our last chance to get to people when the crisis peaks,&quot; said Kristalina Georgieva, the European commissioner for humanitarian aid. &quot;Right now people across the Sahel are starting to scrape the bottom of empty grain stores. Their only remaining options are to sell their animals, farm tools and eat the grain they should now be planting for the next harvest.&quot; In the next few months Agir will be working on long-term solutions  improving irrigation, strengthening social safety nets, boosting agriculture  and will provide funding estimates. &quot;The Agir Sahel initiative will bring together all the key players in this challenge and give people in the region hope for a more stable future in the long term,&quot; said Andris Piebalgs, the EU development commissioner. &quot;The EU will play its part by focusing its aid on agriculture and food security in the coming years. This is one of the key foundations on which we can build sustainable and inclusive growth&quot;. Stephen O&apos;Brien, the international development minister, is on his way to Niger, whose government has been at the forefront in emphasising the seriousness of the crisis. DfID has announced 20m in emergency aid for the Sahel since the crisis began. O&apos;Brien warned that agencies need extra support to treat the effects of acute hunger before the rainy season starting in four weeks&apos; time makes vast swathes of west Africa inaccessible for aid workers. &quot;Britain will not sit back while children starve to death in the Sahel and the feeding centres I will visit prove how our swift and early action is saving lives,&quot; said O&apos;Brien, the first British minister to visit Niger for seven years. &quot;The crisis is already desperate and is getting worse. Now is the time for others in the international community to step up.&quot; President Mahamadou Issoufou of Niger has been touring European capitals to emphasise the urgency of the situation. After meeting NGOs from the Sahel working group (which issued its own recommendation on resilience last year) at the Foreign Office on Monday Issoufou appealed for international backing for his $2.6bn (1.6bn) 3N initiative (Nigeriens nourish Nigeriens) to build the country&apos;s agricultural capacity. &quot;Since August 2011, when crops began to fail and the rains were inadequate, we set up an emergency programme to mobilise all our efforts in alleviating the immediate situation for the people of Niger,&quot; he said. &quot;However, we must also look to the long-term and we need a cohesive structural response to help tackle drought and climate change if we are to move forward.&quot; The Sahel working group called for donors to meet the $864m funding gap still needed to meet the immediate emergency needs and for longer term investment in efforts to avoid future food crises.",

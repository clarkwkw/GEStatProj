    "text": "     Ubisoft has launched its first gameplay trailer for Assassin&apos;s Creed III. The two-minute video shows half-British, half-Mohawk protagonist Connor Kenway agonising over which side to take in the American revolution. From the look of the trailer footage, the Red Coats don&apos;t fare well in his deliberations.  There are scenes of large battles, as well as some traditional Assassin&apos;s Creed parkour in a bustling port city. We can expect to see much more at E3. The game is out on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 31 October.",

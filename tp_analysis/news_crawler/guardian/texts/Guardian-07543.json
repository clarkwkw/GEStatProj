    "headline": "Olympic hunger summit, Colombia, and Hillary Clinton's hypocrisy", 
    "text": "Just hours before the Olympic flame was extinguished in London, the UK and Brazil co-hosted a summit, attended by Britain&apos;s double Olympic champion Mo Farah, to address the problems of hunger and nutrition. Britain&apos;s prime minister, David Cameron, received suggestions for the summit&apos;s agenda and outcome expectations, including from Caroline Kende-Robb, of the Africa Progress Panel, who said the summit needed to produce policies that support Africa&apos;s farmers. Lawrence Haddad, from the Institute of Development Studies, called for making efforts to fight malnutrition more transparent to ensure commitments are not forgotten. The summit&apos;s targets to reduce the number of malnourished and stunted children in the world by the next Olympics in 2016 and by 2025 were welcomed by some as a step in the right direction, while others said more fundamental changes to the global food system are needed for lasting change to occur. Elsewhere on the site On our Poverty matters blog, Jonathan Glennie argues that the Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos is, through his drive to be modern, rebalancing his hardline predecessor&apos;s policies. Indian economist Jayati Ghosh accused Hillary Clinton of hypocrisy, following a speech the US secretary of state gave in Senegal that suggested African countries exercise caution when dealing with companies seeking to exploit their natural resources. Amy Horton argued that the world is teetering on the brink of another global food crisis as food speculators drive up cereal prices. Hackday data challenge How can we use aid and government spending data to answer questions about development? On 25 and 26 August, the Guardian is hosting a two-day collaboration between hacks and hackers, developers and development experts, to interrogate  and explore the limits of  recently released data on development spending and finance. The event is part of a global development data challenge and will help kick off hackdays around the world. Tell us the big questions we should tackle. Multimedia Video: Niger in food and nutrition crisis The failure of last year&apos;s rains combined with an influx of refugees escaping violence in neighbouring Mali has put huge strain on Niger, which is once again experiencing a food crisis. The government has plans to avert future crises through increased investment in agriculture, but there are concerns this move will not be enough. Sean Smith travelled to Niger with Echo, the European commission&apos;s humanitarian aid and civil protection department, to report on the situation. Audio slideshow: Kenya&apos;s road crash victims Bright Oywaya was injured in a road crash in 1997, and now counsels others who have become disabled in similar circumstances. She highlights the problems facing disabled people in Kenya, which  though it has east Africa&apos;s highest rate of road accidents  has only one spinal injuries clinic. In pictures: Thousands seek refuge as conflict in Congo escalates Rebels have captured key towns in the worst conflict for nearly five years, forcing refugees to flee to Kibati on the outskirts of Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. At a meeting of regional leaders in Kampala, defence ministers were told to look for urgent solutions. Coming up on the site We&apos;ll be discussing the role of sport in development in this month&apos;s Global development podcast. Sean Smith travels to Niger to examine the impact of refugees fleeing violence in neighbouring Mali. And we&apos;ll update you on what has happened to Omar, the Somali teenage refugee we reported on in February. Omar had fled a refugee camp in Libya when war broke out last year and was in a camp in Tunisia. We meet him as he prepares for the next chapter in his life. What you said: some of the best comments from our readers Commenting on our development data hackday talk point, istheremoretosay suggested:  What proportion of aid comes with conditions such as having to be spent on products from that donor&apos;s industries?  On our talk point on sport and development, ScoEntAfrica said:  Some children gain in confidence being part of a successful team and this is very important in countries where children&apos;s rights are rarely respected.  On Joseph Hanlon&apos;s blog about the direction Mozambique should take its agricultural policies, ivanidea said:  The closer to home a solution is found, the stronger  the implementation of the solution will be  greater ownership will empower the people on the ground to own the problems and the solutions to those problems  they just need some help on the way  organisation, information sharing and microfinance.  Highlights from the blogosphere On the Center for Global Development blog, Owen Barder expresses his concerns over Sunday&apos;s hunger summit, arguing that it was wrong to conflate the problem of hunger with the need to improve agricultural productivity, and why discussions should focus on the structural causes of hunger, rather than just money. On ThinkAfricaPress, Billie McTernan examines the highs and lows of Africa&apos;s Olympic record. And on Global Voices, Kanigui curates the debate raging in the media, on forums and blogs over increased university fees in Ivory Coast.

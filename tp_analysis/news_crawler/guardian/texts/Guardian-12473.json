    "text": "English universities may be on the brink of an experiment that no one alive today has experienced: a significant and sustained decline in student numbers. Apart from a downward blip between the wars, higher education has been on an inexorably upward trajectory since the birth of the modern age. There is a lot of talk today about a triple-dip recession. In universities there is a parallel fear. There has already been a double-dip  13% fewer students accepted this year. Applications for next autumn, initially well down, have struggled to recover to just above last year&apos;s disappointing total. Despite this (kind of) recovery, student numbers will continue to fall as the big cohorts of 2010 and 2011 work their way through the system. So a third year of decline cannot be discounted. Two questions immediately arise. Will it happen, and will it matter? The government&apos;s official line is that it still expects expansion. But it is hard to suppress the suspicion that the Treasury is betting on decline, if only because the half-baked reforms on student fees and funding will break the bank otherwise. Those of us who argued that tripling fees would reduce demand were dismissed as Cassandras. Dubious data from other countries, and the experience when Charles Clarke raised fees to 3,000 and demand bounced back, were cited as evidence. But things are different now. First, when Labour increased fees the number of young adults was rising. Today the demographic tide is flowing in reverse. Second, the UK Border Agency, as it blunders to implement the government&apos;s anti-immigration policies, is discouraging international student recruitment in important markets. Third, Michael Gove is turning the clock back in schools. GCSEs are being replaced by English Baccalaureate Certificates, with unpredictable consequences. A-levels are being restricted in two ways  by cutting the links with broader AS-levels and dividing them into &quot;U&quot; and &quot;non-U&quot; subjects. An integrated system of state schools is rapidly being superseded by a chaos of academies and &quot;free&quot; schools. It was the introduction of comprehensives and GCSEs that increased the pool of potential university applicants. Also, AS-levels and modular courses opened up student choice. The main drag factor on student expansion is more fundamental, though. It is now clear that Britain will experience a decade of lost growth. If we are lucky, by 2018 we will be back where we were in 2008. That experience is already being etched on the mood of the nation. Attitudes to higher education, and everything else, will be deeply marked. Although the most deprived have been hardest hit by the recession (and the government&apos;s ill-chosen remedies), the aspirational classes have not escaped. Free, or subsidised, public services are dwindling while secure professional careers are becoming scarcer. Costs are rising, putting pressure on family budgets, just when the benefits of investing in the future are harder to identify. Transformative Finally, there are some ugly attitudes among the powerful and influential. The misguided on the left are losing faith in the transformative impact of higher education and mutter irrelevantly about reviving apprenticeships. The right slavers for a shrunken system reduced to its elite core  floreat Bullingdon Club. So the answer to the first question is that a semi-permanent decline in student numbers is becoming more likely. Does it matter? For universities it matters a lot. Put simply, higher education, like the economy, is addicted to &quot;more&quot;. Its intellectual creativity and scientific productivity depend on growth  of student numbers (whether &quot;additional student numbers&quot; awarded by Hefce in the bad old Labour days or relaxed &quot;student number controls&quot; in Brave New Willetts world) and of research income (by improving research excellence framework performances and more aggressive grant seeking). All the values of higher education  both widening participation and boosting reputation  assume growth. So too do its management systems, incentives and daily habits. There is a risk, with no or reverse growth, that the system could come close to collapse morally and managerially. For our nation  and world  it matters even more. No other country is so complacently contemplating decline. Most are pushing hard for growth. The reason is simple. The number of what the political economist Robert Reich called &quot;knowledge workers&quot;, most of whom need to be graduates, is increasing exponentially; high-tech and &quot;knowledge services&quot; drive the economy. But it is not just the economy. To confront the challenges we face we need to cultivate a critical humanity, open minds in open societies. Of course, you don&apos;t need to be a graduate to do this. But it is becoming more and more difficult actively to engage without at least, in Lord Robbins&apos;s famous phrase half a century ago, &quot;the smell of a higher education&quot;.

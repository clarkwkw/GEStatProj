    "text": "Child brides Cowered in the farthest corner of the dank and dirty room, a baby cradled in her weak and scarred arms. Her eyes a window to her broken soul. Swollen bruises mutilated her face  the consequences of what seemed like a million, barbaric beatings. Though oppression and unjust, were merely part of her everyday routine. This female is one of the 10 million child brides forced into unfair marriages every year. Currently, 60 million child brides are married to men twice their age or older. Some of them are no more than four years old themselves. The devastating impact of child marriage is far too high for society to continue to overlook. Forced child marriage is a dangerous abuse issue, which breaches human rights. Officially, all humans have the right to decide upon marriage, why do these girls not? An Arabian victim said: &quot;My father told me I had to. I was less than 10 years old, my husband was 35. I wanted to finish school, but he wouldn&apos;t let me&quot;. This quote shows that the life of a child bride is a life of depression and torment, a life as if bound by chains. Deprived of education, health, freedom and youth. The majority of child brides will endure rape, violence and emotional scarring. Pregnancies are inevitable, and occur before the female is neither, emotionally or physically prepared, making childbirth the dominant cause of death in 15- to 19-year olds. Hopefully, the immoral, inhumane prospect of child marriage can be destroyed with education and enforcement of universal law.",

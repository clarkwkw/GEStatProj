    "text": "Daniel Willingham&apos;s and Michael Gove&apos;s idea that a grasp of basic facts in school is &quot;best achieved by repeated drilling&quot; (Report, 29 December) is not an agreed axiom of education. On the contrary, it is probably the mistake doing most to hobble modern schooling. Drilling was only efficacious in the past with pupils from disciplinarian homes. For many children, it was a pointless bore. In this way much of the effect of schooling was lost. Psychologists have discovered that children learn spontaneously when they meet things which are both interesting and (perceived by them to be) important. This is built into human biology and is how most of us picked up most of the things we learnt before we went to school, and after we left. Children now have computer games and the idea that drilling will switch them on has lost whatever vestiges of plausibility it once enjoyed.Chris OrmellEditor, Prospero",

    "text": "Description This sea slug has a delicate leaf-shaped body up to 5 cm in length tapering off to a point.  Ecology This species is commonly vivid green, and occasionally bright red or brown. It feeds on seaweed and takes its colour from the seaweed&apos;s photosynthesising cells (chloroplasts). The chloroplasts are retained unharmed in its body, where they continue to photosynthesise  the sugars they produce supplement the sea slug&apos;s diet. Distribution It can be found in shallow water and rock pools in European waters, with most British records being from western coasts.

    "headline": "How would UK higher education fare if Britain left the EU?", 
    "text": "Education secretary Michael Gove unleashed another political storm this week when he said he would vote against EU membership in a referendum. The question of whether the UK could quit the EU is well and truly back on the table. Those in favour of quitting Europe tend to argue that by leaving the EU the UK would save on costly membership fees, cut down on migration, and no longer be subject to EU legislation, while those who want to stay in Europe argue that leaving could threaten trade and investment and damage Britain&apos;s global standing. But what impact would leaving the EU have on the UK&apos;s higher education sector? Research suggests a departure could lead to declining quality and standards in UK universities, and could actually increase higher education costs to the taxpayer. HESA figures from 2011 reveal that there are 73,660 full-time undergraduate students from the EU currently studying in British universities. These students enjoy many of the benefits available to British students. Their tuition fees are capped at 9,000 a year (while fees for overseas students can be much higher) and, unlike overseas students, they can access our generous fee loan system, meaning their fees are deferred until after they graduate and are repayable only once they get a job. Recent evidence suggests many of these loans remain unpaid . EU students would almost certainly become financially worse off if Britain were to leave the EU. Universities could charge them as much as overseas students since their fees would no longer be subject to government regulation, and what&apos;s more, they would no longer be able to access UK government backed fee loans so would have to find the money up-front. The likely outcome is that many EU students would decide to undertake their studies elsewhere. This could be good for UK students. Because of our quota system, demand far outstrips supply in UK universities with around 1.3 applicants to every acceptance in 2012, leaving many UK students unable to obtain a place at university. A fall in EU students would free up scarce places and mean more UK students could get onto the course of their choice. What about the consequences for UK universities? A fall in EU student numbers should leave UK universities no worse off financially. Judging by current demand, those universities impacted could easily make up the numbers of lost EU students with UK students paying at the same rate, and they might even be able to squeeze a few thousand pounds more out of those EU students who decide to stay. But there would be negative effects too  those UK students who were beaten to a place by an EU rival presumably failed to get on their course because they weren&apos;t as academically able thus a fall in EU students could be accompanied by a fall in the quality of the student intake. Moreover, EU nationals make up a large proportion of teaching and research staff at many UK universities, and there could be serious consequences for the university environment as a whole if it becomes harder for them to gain employment here. There might also be negative consequences for the taxpayer. While EU students have access to government tuition fee loans, they cannot apply for maintenance loans or grants. UK students can access more taxpayer-funded benefits, so increasing their numbers at the expense of EU students will be costly. There are many other drawbacks to having fewer EU students on courses. For example, visiting foreign students spend significant amounts of money on goods and services, improving the balances of payments and raising GDP (gross domestic product). Once students complete their studies many stay in the country, contributing to the UK economy. There is also the potential benefit that international students who return to their home countries are more likely to consume goods and services from companies they became acquainted with during their time studying in the UK. Perhaps most importantly, it would result in domestic students having less exposure to different cultures and ways of life during their time at university. Depriving our students of the chance to meet and work with students from different backgrounds seems ill advised.

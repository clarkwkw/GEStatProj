    "headline": "What makes a first-class qualification?", 
    "text": "The claim that degree standards have risen, commensurate with A-level standards, and that this explains the doubling of first class degrees in British universities (Report, 11 January) will raise hollow laughter among those of us with experience of teaching in universities. How well some of us remember demands that we demonstrate &quot;added value&quot; and comparability with universities awarding high numbers of firsts. Faculties were ordered to amend regulations to allow fewer courses to count toward a first and to moderate our marking to allow marks to slide into the first-class area. Many externals colluded in this process and many lecturers kept their heads down. Many undergraduates are wonderful, intelligent people but they have not suddenly doubled their abilities.Clive TempestWestbury on Severn, Gloucestershire  Peter Wilby (At last, Britain&apos;s qualification spiral is beginning to unravel, 9 January) oversimplifies this important topic by not differentiating those careers that require graduate-level qualification from those that do not. The important distinction is whether a high level of scientific or academic knowledge is needed to underpin practice. Medicine, law and design engineering are examples where such knowledge is self-evidently essential. Journalism, surveying and sports management are examples for which the opposite is true. Second, Wilby assumes that professions currently require only initial training and suggests this should be reduced and balanced by a requirement for regular top-up training. But this is already a requirement in all health professions and probably in many others. Roger PaxtonMorpeth, Northumberland",

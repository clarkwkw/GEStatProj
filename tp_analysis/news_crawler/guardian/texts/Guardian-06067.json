    "text": "I wasn&apos;t sure about Doom 3 when it first arrived. The game&apos;s shonky AI, manipulative spawn points and dozy story seemed at odds with its astonishing id Tech 4-powered visuals. The title shifted over three million copies, though, so I was clearly in a minority.  Soon, we&apos;ll all get a chance to reassess the game, though. On 19 October it&apos;s being re-released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360, complete with the Resurrection of Evil add-on pack as well as several previously unreleased levels, packed together and entitled, The Lost Mission. The visuals have been optimised to support 3D, there&apos;s 5.1 Dolby sound and improved rendering and lighting. Other additions include optimised controls, a new checkpoint save system and a mounted flashlight  so you don&apos;t get scared of dark corners.  This is all reasonable stuff, and it will be interesting to see what&apos;s in those new levels. Plus, for those who haven&apos;t already bought them a hundred times before, the first two Doom titles are included in the package.  It&apos;s an interesting time to re-assess the Doom phenomenon. The series&apos; run-and-gun gameplay, health packs and vanilla multiplayer looked dated for a while, but elements of old school design may well be coming back into favour, especially with Counter Strike also making a return this summer, courtesy of Valve&apos;s Global Offensive. Also, horror shooters were very much on the agenda at E3, with Dead Space 3, ZombiU, Resident Evil 6 and Metro: Last Night all pulling in plaudits. The influence of Doom 3 lurks over them all like a cursed spirit. This Halloween may be the perfect time to allows the demons to surface once again.",

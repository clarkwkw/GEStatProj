    "text": "As the progress of the government&apos;s academies and free schools programme continues to dominate the education agenda with a rolling programme of announcements, rather less national discussion is taking place on what could be a far greater change in our education system. The government has delayed the implementation of its curriculum review, but the shape of what is likely to happen is beginning to emerge. The secretary of state&apos;s announcement on computer science may have been 18 months late  he has barely mentioned ICT up to now  but nevertheless, his arrival in the 21st century is welcome and the policy itself has much to commend it. What we teach in our schools is one of the most important decisions we make as a nation. The knowledge passed on to the next generation, the skills and abilities that we think children will need when they become adults, the attitudes and values we wish to instil in them are all at the core of the curriculum and can shape our society, let alone our economy, for years. It is not unreasonable, then, to expect the government to debate the assumptions that will influence its decisions. Yet whereas Michael Gove has addressed the nation on the importance of teaching the kings and queens of England, he has been rather less expansive on some of the bigger questions. To my mind, two issues are fundamental. First, who should control the curriculum? Second, should it be national, and so compulsory for all children, or should it offer greater flexibility to accommodate the wishes and abilities of individual children and their parents? These are big questions and don&apos;t lend themselves to easy answers. In a democracy, it seems right that the government should shape the curriculum. Beyond that, different subjects will want to call on different resources to decide detailed curriculum content. Few would argue that universities and employers shouldn&apos;t influence what is taught in schools, or that there shouldn&apos;t be some flexibility for individual schools and teachers to make their own decisions. It would be unwise to deny a voice to parents or indeed some young people about what is in the curriculum, and religious leaders certainly wish to influence what is taught in the 7,000 faith schools. Balancing these legitimate interests isn&apos;t easy. Yet the only debate from the government about control of the curriculum has centred on the extra freedoms that will be granted to teachers in academies and free schools. It seems that the government&apos;s answer to the question &apos;who should control the content of the curriculum?&apos; is that it depends on whether the school is an academy or not. If it is, control rests with teachers; if not, it will presumably remain with the government. The same approach is evident in the response to the other key question  the extent to which the curriculum should be compulsory. This has long been a difficult and contentious issue. The national curriculum provides an entitlement to all children to be taught a range of subjects. It stops schools giving up on children who find it difficult to learn or who are difficult to teach. Yet there is no doubt that for some young people the national curriculum is too rigid and its restrictions can stifle teachers&apos; creativity. Getting the balance right between the entitlement guaranteed by a national curriculum and the flexibility sometimes called for isn&apos;t easy. So what is the government&apos;s response? Schools can have extra flexibility, but only if they are an academy or free school. On what possible basis can the answers to these key questions about the curriculum be determined by the legal category of the school and not the needs of the children in them? Have children in non-academy schools less need for flexibility or are their teachers less likely to use such freedoms responsibly? The truth is that the government has sacrificed its curriculum review to its overriding ambition on academy numbers. It has used curriculum freedom to entice more schools to follow the academy route rather than leading a genuine national debate about the future needs of all children in all schools.",

    "text": "It&apos;s time for our weekly roundup of new games for smartphones and tablets, this time covering iOS, Android and Windows Phone. The week&apos;s pick of new and notable games includes football, superheroes, music conducting, zombies, demons and baseball. A heady brew. Fluid Football Alongside New Star Soccer, the iOS version of Fluid Football has been proving that there&apos;s room in the football game genre for indie innovation. Its Android port will be welcomed by fans, with its line-drawing gameplay as you plot the best route to goal for your players.Android Marvel War of Heroes Originally intended for inclusion last week, this is a big deal: Marvel&apos;s stable of superheroes (including Spider-Man, Hulk and Iron Man) meet DeNA&apos;s Mobage social mobile gaming network, and the card-battling genre that&apos;s been so lucrative for games like Rage of Bahamut. In this case, you&apos;re building a team of superheroes and battling other players.iPhone My NBA2K This is a companion app for console game NBA 2K13, but it&apos;s also a collection of basketball-themed mini-games in its own right. The clever bit is that playing this mobile version earns you virtual currency for use in the console edition, on PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U. The link above is for Android, but here&apos;s the iOS version.Android / iPhone / iPad Symphonica Square Enix is having a crack at reinventing music games for touchscreens with Symphonica, which focuses on a classical music conductor. It wraps a proper storyline around the conducting gameplay, which features nearly 50 works. Individual chapters are sold via in-app purchase. The link above is for iPhone, but here&apos;s the iPad version.iPhone / iPad Global Outbreak Global Outbreak is the latest game from location-based games publisher Red Robot Labs, following its popular Life is Crime. That focused on gangsters, but this has more of an &quot;enraged zombie mutants&quot; vibe, as you travel the world ridding the streets of the undead.Android Sonic Jump Sonic the Hedgehog returns to iOS, but this time Sega has him jumping upwards rather than running sideways. The game involves bouncing on platforms grabbing rings, unlocking new characters and power-ups, and beating bosses. And if all this sounds a bit too much like Doodle Jump for comfort, well, the game was out for feature phones before the iPhone even existed...iPhone / iPad Real Football 2013 Shortly after its iOS release, Real Football 2013 has also launched on Android. Gameloft&apos;s football game has a hatful of licences, impressive graphics, and  new for 2013 a deeper club development mode. It&apos;s also freemium, which should make for some interesting competition with rival FIFA 13.Android Knights of Pen &amp; Paper This looks marvellous: an &quot;indie turn-based retro style pixel-art RPG&quot; that aims to recapture the feel of pen&apos;n&apos;paper roleplaying in the 1990s. Expect sackfuls of monsters, loot and dungeoneering, with the nice twist that you get to play dungeon master as well as hero.Android Carmageddon Here&apos;s a famous name from the days when a few red splashes on-screen were enough to get tabloids frothing about violent games (oh, actually, those days never did go away...) Carmageddon is a driving game with the emphasis firmly on the knocking things over and causing carnage side of driving.iPhone / iPad Sumioni Demon Arts THD &quot;You will be demon ink!&quot; promises the Google Play listing for this stylish Android game, which is certainly a pitch I haven&apos;t heard before from a mobile game. It originally appeared on Sony&apos;s PS Vita handheld, with characterful graphics. Runs best in its current incarnation on devices with the latest Tegra processors.Android Razor Salvation THD And here&apos;s another Tegra-focused Android game, the first in a planned series of action titles that sees you saving the world from an alien invasion. Beefy graphics and destructible environments make the most of the processors, and it also works in stereoscopic TV when your device is hooked up to a compatible TV.Android Cracking Sands Microsoft is continuing its steady flow of one Xbox Live game a week for Windows Phone smartphones. Off-road racer Cracking Sands is the latest, which ditches the idea of vehicle categories in favour of a great big free-for-all where dirty tactics go side-by-side with racing skills.Windows Phone Sir Death If you&apos;ve been thinking &apos;really, there aren&apos;t enough zombie games on the App Store, WHO will bring me another?&apos;, help is at hand from Gamevil. You play the Sir Death character, dealing lordly execution to the brains of hordes of zombies, with lashings of blood and freemium business models.iPhone / iPad Hum This! Covered in more depth on the Apps Blog earlier in the week, this is a cross between Draw Something and SongPop that sees you humming assigned songs then pinging them to friends to guess the tune. O2, HMV and Ticketmaster are on board to supply prizes for the best successful streaks, and 30% of the profits are shared between charities Nordoff Robbins and War Child.Android / iPhone / iPad MLB Winning Streak This baseball game is thus far only available in the US for Android devices. It&apos;s another Mobage-branded card battler game, this time with an official licence from Major League Baseball. That means the gameplay involves constructing the perfect team while playing against people online.Android Fighting Fantasy: Blood of the Zombies Here&apos;s another well-loved brand from a few decades ago being revived for the App Store. Ian Livingstone has teamed up with Tin Man Games to make a &quot;digital Fighting Fantasy gamebook&quot; based on the famous roleplaying books series. And yes, zombies are the focus here too.iPhone / iPad W.E.L.D.E.R. For all the console-quality 3D graphics and action-adventure games (and zombies) being flung at mobile devices in 2012, it&apos;s still hard to beat a really good word game for addictiveness. W.E.L.D.E.R. is a really good word game that&apos;s just made the leap from iOS to Android. It&apos;s like a supercharged mutation of Boggle and Scrabble, with power-ups and multipliers aplenty.Android Super-Fluid Super-Fluid has an unusual history: it&apos;s the work of a collective of young developers, gathered by Virgin Media as part of its 100 Day Game Project to make a new mobile game in... Well, you can guess the time limit. It&apos;s a puzzle game that sees you transforming between solid, liquid and gas states.Android / iPhone / iPad Monster Quest Monster-training is a huge game genre in its own right in Japan. Monster Quest brings the idea West, as you collect monsters and create your own to battle against others. Hundreds of quests and goals give plenty of depth, with its online aspects also spanning the globe.iPhone / iPad Robbery Bob Chillingo&apos;s Robbery Bob was great fun on iOS, and looks just as good on Android. It stars a &quot;hapless burglar&quot; called Bob, who has to sneak through a bunch of buildings avoiding guards and dogs while snaffling whatever you can get your hands on.Android That&apos;s our selection, but what are you playing this week on your smartphone or tablet?

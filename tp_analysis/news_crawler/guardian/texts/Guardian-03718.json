    "text": "Aid groups have criticised the UK government for a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; in failing to press ahead with a bill that would enshrine in law plans to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on development aid. The omission from the Queen&apos;s speech, which sets out the legislative timetable for the coming parliamentary session, hardly came as a surprise. Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, has been hinting in recent months that the bill would not feature because of a lack of parliamentary time, given the government&apos;s focus on the economy. In her speech, the Queen said the government would only &quot;set out firm plans to spend 0.7% of [GNI] as official development assistance from 2013&quot;. Spending 0.7% of GNI on aid is a long-standing UN goal, first mooted in 1970, and all three main UK parties have signed up to it. George Osborne, the chancellor, has allowed for the increase in his budget, from the present 0.54% but, without legislation, aid groups fear the percentage could decrease in future budgets. The coalition government made an election pledge of passing into law a commitment to give 0.7% of national income in foreign aid. The Department for International Development (DfID) stuck to its recent line that a bill will be introduced, time allowing. &quot;The commitment to legislate was set out in the coalition programme,&quot; said a DfID official. &quot;The bill is ready and will be introduced when parliamentary time allows. The coalition government is the first government in history to set out, in black and white in the spending review, clear plans to honour the lifesaving aid pledge from 2013. This historic move was reconfirmed in the autumn statement and most recently in the March budget.&quot; Aid groups, however, voiced disappointment at the omission of legislation on the 0.7% target. &quot;The government&apos;s commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid is welcome and will ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in fighting global poverty,&quot; said Marg Mayne, the chief executive of VSO. &quot;However, it&apos;s disappointing that the promise to enshrine 0.7% in law has not yet been honoured. This is a missed opportunity to signal to the world that Britain shall not waver in its commitment to support the world&apos;s poorest people.&quot; Adrian Lovett, the Europe executive director of ONE, the advocacy group, said it was a missed opportunity. &quot;This is a short bill which is supported by all three major political parties. It can be passed quickly and should not detract from other parliamentary business. By legislating, the government will ensure this life-saving aid is secured and will increase the pressure on other countries to do more. David Cameron and Nick Clegg should ensure this legislation is in place before welcoming world leaders for the G8 summit in the UK next year.&quot; Melanie Ward, the head of public affairs at ActionAid, said: &quot;Legislation matters because aid needs to be around long enough to do the job. Many countries such as Ghana are now moving towards an end to dependency on aid but this can only happen if we support them until that point. Legislation would provide the certainty that is needed for aid to be most effective.&quot; Ward added that the world is watching Cameron&apos;s actions on international development because he is co-chairing a UN taskforce to decide what will happen when the millennium development goals (MDGs) expire in 2015. &quot;The government backing down on its commitment to legislate on aid would delight those who oppose the UK&apos;s progressive stance on aid and dismay those who believe that Britain must stick to its word,&quot; she warned. The 0.7% figure translates into 1.6p in every pound of government spending. Only five countries have met the target  Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. According to analysis from the UN Millennium Project, led by the economist Jeffrey Sachs, 0.7% of GNI from rich countries can provide enough resources to meet the MDGs of improving the lives of the world&apos;s poorest people. Some development experts, however, question the fixation on the 0.7% target in the aid lobby. John Hilary, the executive director of War on Want, argued it was more important to focus on structural issues such as the terms of foreign trade and investment, where the advantage is skewed towards rich countries and large corporations. &quot;The key question is under what circumstances countries use foreign investment,&quot; said Hilary. &quot;Is it for development purposes or exploitation? With globalisation, poor countries have been exploited either for their natural resources or for their labour for the benefit of the west. British governments have consistently argued against binding rules on multinational corporations at the UN in favour of voluntary guidelines. This leaves powerful corporations to operate on their own terms at the expense of local communities.&quot;",

    "text": "A leading body representing private schools has turned on education secretary Michael Gove over his plans for A-level reform, describing them as elitist and liable to deter thousands of children from post-16 education. Neil Roskilly, chief executive of the Independent Schools Association (ISA), which represents more than 300 fee-paying schools, says Gove&apos;s plan for leading universities to dictate the content of A-levels is unworkable and liable to push many less academically-able children out of education early. The education secretary is proposing that leading universities take a central role in designing A-level syllabuses and exams from 2014 in order to toughen the qualification amid concerns over its credibility. Gove has asked the exams regulator, Ofqual, to oversee the process, which would include at least 20 UK universities being required to endorse each new subject syllabus, with 12 of those being research institutions and probably members of the elite Russell Group. But in a sign of the widespread concern over the proposal, criticism has emerged from the most unlikely quarters, including one of the leading bodies in the fee-paying sector. Roskilly, a former sixth form centre principal who now heads the ISA, said he feared that making A-levels akin to an entrance examination to university would put children off taking them altogether. He said the risk was high because many pupils felt there was a prohibitive financial cost to university education, because of last year&apos;s trebling of tuition fees, and would come to regard A-levels as an unnecessary qualification. He added: &quot;I think it is elitism. I think Gove sees universities as an answer to some of the problems in the last few years. But there is a great danger that if you tinker with A-levels [you] do huge damage to something that employers have a huge amount of confidence in. &quot;Some pupils will be put off taking A-levels and that is a great shame because they cover a large number of the population that is studying post-16 and people may be looking for alternatives already. &quot;The message out there is that A-levels are getting more difficult. It is right that they are more rigorous, but whether you want them to be more difficult and covering a smaller ability range is another matter. This is all a reaction to the grade inflation but making them more difficult is not the solution. They have said that the qualification must be suitable for progression to higher education. That basically means that A-levels as a qualification in their own right are no longer free standing.&quot; Roskilly said he was also concerned that A-levels would become too specialised and there would be a tendency for universities only to accept candidates who had studied syllabuses their institution was involved in devising. He said: &quot;They are going to favour candidates who have studied their own endorsed qualification even if there are better qualified candidates elsewhere. &quot;Plus there is no guarantee that the Russell group universities are the best in their field in A-level general studies or drama or something like that. It is not going to be something that Russell Group universities will have experience in at all. Most A-levels are very general and provide a good coverage of the subject. Whereas most universities are very specialised. &quot;We will send in a contribution to the consultatation. There is no guarantee that they will listen to any of that of course. You have got a secretary of state there who is banging the table a little bit and saying this is the way it has got to be and people try and fit in with that.&quot; A Department for Education spokesman said: &quot;Leading academics in our best universities have been clear that there are some serious problems with A-levels and they are not preparing pupils properly for rigorous degrees. &quot;The Department for Education is withdrawing from involvement in A-levels. Improving them is now a matter primarily for good universities and exam boards.&quot;",

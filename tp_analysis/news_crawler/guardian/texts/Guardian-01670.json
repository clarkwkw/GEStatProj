    "text": "    This video is full of fun geekiness, where physicists and mathematicians talk about &quot;really big numbers&quot;. How big are these &quot;really big numbers&quot;? How about the number 10100, which translates into 1 followed by 100 zeros? The shorthand name for that number is a Googol. Oh, maybe that number isn&apos;t big enough for you then? How about 10Googol, which translates into 10(10100)? The original definition of that really big number is &quot;one, followed by writing zeroes until you get tired&quot;. Since people would get tired of writing zeros at different times, the definition of a Googolplex was formalised as 10(10100).    Here are several of our favourite mathematicians talking about these two really really big numbers:             Visit numberphile&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

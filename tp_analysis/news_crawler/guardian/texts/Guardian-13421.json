    "text": "   Peter Grant Photograph: Peter Grant    In August 2008 I went to the world Aids conference in Mexico City and heard a woman speak about being raped three times as a teenager. I was shocked, both by her suffering and by the apparent impunity of the men involved. It is primarily men who have to change if violence against women is to be ended. Yet very few men seem to be active in prevention or response. I am also a Christian, and Christian men are even less engaged. Churches are often silent despite a worldwide epidemic of domestic and sexual abuse. I talked with a colleague, Mandy Marshall, who was also at the conference. We came away with two questions: where is the church and where are the men when it comes to preventing violence against women? This started us on a journey which led in 2010 to the foundation of Restored, an international Christian alliance working to strengthen relationships and end violence against women. We want to see churches becoming safe places where women can receive a positive and appropriate response to the disclosure of abuse. We want to challenge any teaching in churches that diminishes or undermines women, and to encourage churches to support the work of local refuges and other services for women affected by violence. As part of our vision we want to see women and men standing together to prevent violence against women. Our campaign for men in the UK is called First Man Standing, and is an opportunity for men everywhere to be the first in their family, sports club or workplace to stand up and speak out about building strong relationships and ending violence against women. We ask men to do three things: respect all women and demonstrate love and support for the women and children in their own lives; challenge other men by speaking out to their friends and colleagues about ending violence and negative attitudes towards women; and make a personal pledge never to commit, condone or remain silent about violence against women. It has been encouraging over the past year to hear of men getting passionate about the issues, seeking out training, supporting women, challenging the language of friends and colleagues, and intervening to stop violence.",

Victorian public health reforms generally get a good press  decent sewage systems, clean water, rules about food hygiene, etc. But sometimes people thought that the protection of the &apos;public&apos; health had gone too far, and that individual rights were being ignored. The Vaccination Acts in the second half of the nineteenth century led to petitions, court cases, a great number of furious newspaper articles, and the odd small riot (for more on this, see Nadja Durbach&apos;s Bodily Matters or listen to her on BBC Radio 4&apos;s In Our Time) The Contagious Diseases Acts of the 1860s were just as controversial. Worried about the large amount of military sickness caused by venereal disease (as many as one in three diseased soldiers or sailors had a sexually transmitted infection) the government introduced legislation to allow the arrest, examination, detention and treatment of suspected prostitutes in specific garrison and port towns. Plain clothes policemen were responsible for watching and arresting women; if a policeman swore that the prisoner was a &apos;common prostitute&apos; she could be forcibly examined for signs of venereal disease, and detained for several months in a specialist &apos;Lock Hospital&apos; while she was treated. &apos;Known prostitutes&apos; were also required to register and to have regular follow-up examinations, on pain of imprisonment if they failed to cooperate. These Acts stimulated a concerted, often feminist, counter-reaction which campaigned for their repeal. Reformers such as Florence Nightingale and Josephine Butler argued that the Acts were not only unfair (after all, men weren&apos;t examined, treated or imprisoned) but in the worst cases amounted to an act of &apos;instrumental rape&apos;, perpetrated through the power of the state and based on the opinion of a single policemen, on women who may have done nothing but be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The compulsory physical examination was certainly brisk and invasive, as gynaecological expert William Acton wrote in 1870   the examinations are conducted with great rapidity. In the course of one hour and three quarters I assisted in the thorough examination of 58 women with the speculum   (that&apos;s less than two minutes per woman). Acton saw no problem with these rather one-sided and invasive laws, and thought they ought to be extended to the whole country, because, after all,   [h]owever much it may be the duty of the State to leave for settlement to the individual conscience all questions of morals and religion, it can hardly be seriously contended that it is right to abandon to the care of the improvident and profligate the restraining of contagious maladies  The arguments against these Acts were successful, and they were suspended in 1883 and repealed in 1886 (many of the records of this campaign are housed at the Women&apos;s Library in London, which was recently threatened with closure). But in Cambridge, the detention of women continued because of a special law passed in 1825 which gave the University unusual powers. The Act for the Better Preservation of Peace and Good Order in the Universities of England made the Proctors of both Cambridge and Oxford into a kind of private police force.  One proctorial duty in Cambridge was to patrol the streets of the town, watching out for women who might be engaging in sexual relationships with students. Once arrested by a Proctor women would be taken to a workhouse called the Spinning House, and held there until the vice-chancellor himself decided their fate  to be released or imprisoned for anything up to a few months. There was no legal recourse of appeal for women caught in this system (although, as Janet Oswald has shown, some may have deliberately sought arrest in the hope of being treated for venereal disease for free).  Cambridge&apos;s system was an inspiration for those who supported the Contagious Diseases Act, and it outlived the national legislation. Thousands of women passed through the Spinning House, until one night in 1891 when 17 year-old Daisy Hopkins was apprehended by a Proctor who saw her talking to Mr Russell, a married student. She was sent to the Spinning House and sentenced to 14 days imprisonment, but released after 10 days when the Queens Court Bench ruled that her imprisonment was illegal. (This was on a technicality, as she&apos;d not been properly charged). Hopkins and her friends defended her good name, and she sued the Proctor for 1000 in damages. Public town meetings expressed indignation and anger that the University could wield such unfair power over Cambridge residents, and although Hopkins lost her case (in a trial where her moral character was systematically taken to pieces) her cause attracted a huge amount of supportive media coverage. Even the New York Times ran a couple of columns about the story. This public outcry was too much; in 1894, nearly a decade after the Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed, another Act abolished the University&apos;s right of &apos;arrest and expulsion of lewd women&apos;, and in 1901 the St Andrews Street Spinning House was demolished (and replaced with a Police Station, now used as Council offices ).

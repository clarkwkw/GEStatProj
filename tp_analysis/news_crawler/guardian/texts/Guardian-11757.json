    "text": "Facebook is extending its experiment charging users to send messages, offering users access to the accounts of VIPs  including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg  for as much as $100 (61) per message. The offer was spotted by Mashable reporter Chris Taylor who tried to message Zuckerberg, but was told the message would be routed to the less visible &quot;other&quot; folder, unless he paid the $100 fee. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Mashable that the company is testing &quot;some extreme price points to see what works to filter spam&quot;. The cost of sending a message is thought to vary according to the popularity of the VIP. The move follows the introduction last year of paid-for posts, as the company tries to increase revenue from its 1 billion users. The trial began in December when Facebook introduced a $1 charge to send a message to the Facebook inbox of someone who is not already a friend, though capped at one paid message per recipient per week. Facebook said at the time it was an &quot;economic signal to determine relevance&quot; and help organise users&apos; messages. &quot;If you want to send a message to someone you heard speak at an event but are not friends with, or if you want to message someone about a job opportunity, you can use this feature to reach their Inbox,&quot; Facebook explained in a blog post. &quot;For the receiver, this test allows them to hear from people who have an important message to send them.&quot;",

    "headline": "Apple's 'slide to unlock' patent win could halt Android sales in Germany", 
    "text": "Apple has won a significant patent battle in Munich that could see Motorola smartphones running Google&apos;s Android software blocked from sale in Germany  and potentially could be expanded to other handsets running Android too. Apple won the case on the basis of the &quot;slide to unlock&quot; system which it introduced with the iPhone in 2007, which indicates how to make the touch screen active. The court decided that two of the devices made by Motorola Mobility (MMI) using Android software infringe the Apple&apos;s patent because they are unlocked by sliding an icon (of a padlock) across the screen.  Update: Motorola insisted in a statement that the decision would not affect &quot;current supply or future sales&quot;. Apple&apos;s complaint failed against Motorola&apos;s Xoom tablet, which uses the Android 3.0 Honeycomb software and is unlocked by moving a padlock icon out of a circle.  The announcement in the Munich I Regional Court is the latest in an ongoing struggle between Apple and a number of Android handset makers also including Samsung and HTC in which it is claiming that they infringe patents it holds on functions embedded in the iPhone. Apple already has a case underway in Mannheim, Germany, in which it is asserting the same patent against Samsung, the biggest Android handset maker.  Earlier in February Motorola won a case against Apple in Mannheim which would force it to disable &quot;push&quot; email over its iCloud and MobileMe services in that country.  The latest judgement  which Motorola is expected to appeal but which Apple could enforce by paying a bond into the court  will further heighten tensions between Apple and Google, which has received almost all the formal approvals it needs to complete its $12.5bn (8bn) acquisition of Motorola Mobility (MMI). &quot;Whenever Apple decides to assert this against additional Android device makers, it can do so in Munich with a high likelihood of success,&quot; Florian Mller, an independent patent analyst who was at the court when the judgement was handed down, told The Guardian. Update: In a statement to the Guardian, Motorola said: &quot;Today&apos;s ruling in the patent litigation brought by Apple in Munich, Germany, concerns a software feature related to phone unlocking in select Motorola devices sold in Germany. Motorola has implemented a new design for the feature. Therefore, we expect no impact on current supply or future sales.&quot; It is not yet clear whether this means Motorola has implemented its own new software feature, or whether the &quot;new design&quot; is the introduction of Android 4&apos;s unlocking system on forthcoming Motorola phones, which uses a different unlocking system from that which Apple sued over. Apple and Microsoft are both attacking Android handset and tablet makers over multiple claims of patent infringement. But the two companies are taking different tacks: Apple is seeking to restrict the sale of products which it claims infringe its patents so that it can expand its sales of the iPhone and iPad. Microsoft, meanwhile, has so far sought to force the manufacturers to pay a licence fee and per-device royalty rather than block their sale. Microsoft has recently won rounds in patents battles in the US against both Motorola and Barnes &amp; Noble. &quot;Today&apos;s ruling is significant bad news for Android at large, and Google,&quot; Mller noted on his blog after the judgment. &quot;Today&apos;s ruling  show that the noose keeps tightening around Android&apos;s neck in many ways.&quot; The Android OS was developed by an independent company started by Andy Rubin, which was acquired by Google in 2005. Google makes the software available for free, but unlike Microsoft over its Windows Phone and Windows Mobile software, does not indemnify licencees against patent claims.  Mller said that Germany  which is Europe&apos;s largest smartphone market, and where Android phones dominate sales  has become the focus for the current patent wars because its courts hand down judgments in such cases more quickly than US federal courts or the US&apos;s International Trade Commission, which can enforce import and export bans for the country. The decision on Thursday followed a trial hearing on 22 December. Motorola may seek to have the judgment struck out on the basis that the patent is invalid on the basis of &quot;obviousness&quot;: patents have to include an &quot;inventive step&quot; and be &quot;non-obvious&quot;. A Dutch court previously indicated that the slide-to-unlock patent could be invalid in a case Apple brought against Samsung.  Microsoft has a hearing in Germany in which it is asserting a different patent against Motorola&apos;s Android devices.  Google has previously indicated that it is buying MMI to acquire its portfolio of 17,000 existing and 7,500 pending patents. But a number of MMI&apos;s patents presently being asserted in court battles against Apple have been declared to be &quot;standards essential&quot; by MMI, and agreed by external standards bodies, meaning that MMI would normally be obliged to license them to anyone at a standard rate and without revocation.  The European Commission and the US Department of Justice have put Apple, Microsoft, Google and MMI on notice that the use of &quot;standards essential patents&quot; (SEPs) in litigation could be investigated as antitrust abuse, and has sought assurances from the companies that they will not do so. While Apple and Microsoft pledged not to do so in letters to the bodies, the EC and DOJ noted that Google&apos;s language was &quot;ambiguous&quot;.",

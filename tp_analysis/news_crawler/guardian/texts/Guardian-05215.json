    "text": "Tisto DJ and musician Tisto has launched his official iPhone app, offering news, tour dates, music and social features for fans. However, if they stump up an additional 3.99 through in-app purchase, they get membership of his InTheBooth subscription scheme, and can create playlist, stream Tisto&apos;s podcast archive and get exclusive content.iPhone Official Celtic FC Here&apos;s another example of a paid app with an additional subscription tier. Scottish football club Celtic&apos;s app costs 2.99, for which fans get news, player profiles, live text and stat updates on match-days, and other content. But if they pay an additional 2.49 a month, they get match highlights and other videos.iPhone Facejacker The app for Channel 4&apos;s new prank show includes character soundboards and a photo-booth feature, as well as exclusive videos. However, its second-screen aspects are more interesting: &quot;Collect a variety of exclusive content by enabling your phone to listen in on the TV episodes, unlocking soundboards, ring tones, videos and more&quot;. Developer Widebeam says it&apos;s the first time a TV show has unlocked app content in this way in the UK.iPhone Domino&apos;s Pizza Domino&apos;s Pizza is spreading its crusty baked love onto another smartphone platform: Windows Phone. Its official app enables people in the UK and Ireland to browse the menu, customise pizzas with toppings, and then order from their device. Vouchers will be added in a future update.Windows Phone Montessori Letter Sounds HD Based on the Montessori teaching method, this iPad app aims to help children learn the alphabet through four mini-games, as well as a toolbox with a phonetic alphabet and sandbox to practice tracing letters.

The idea: &quot;a game that uses scrolling notes to help you learn piano&quot;. You follow what&apos;s happening on the iPad screen while playing along on an external keyboard or piano.

The chain&apos;s PowerUp Rewards scheme is also built in.Android The Tiny Bang Story HD Colibri Games&apos; The Tiny Bang Story is an iPad adventure that focuses on puzzles spread over five chapters, with beautiful hand-drawn visuals and &quot;no text&quot; at all.iPad The Week Magazine US There&apos;s already an app for The Week magazine in the UK, but now there&apos;s also a US version for iPad.

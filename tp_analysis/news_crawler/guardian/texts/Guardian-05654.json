    "text": "Radical&apos;s viral horror follow-up to 2009&apos;s Prototype expands on the corporate conspiracy that has reduced New York to a glorified concentration camp, its citizens unwilling test subjects for a shadowy bio-weapons programme. Typical sci-fi gubbins then, but you&apos;ll be having so much fun leaping around the city and tearing into monsters of science gone wrong that you&apos;ll scarcely care. Having lost his wife and daughter in the outbreak, new hero James Heller makes a compelling lead, one driven by loss and rage. Many of the flesh-warping powers of the first game return, such as claws and tendrils, joined by much-needed combat tweaks such as the ability to dodge. With upgradeable mutations, Heller soon feels monstrously powerful. However, missions can prove repetitive  shape-shift into an enemy, infiltrate bases, kill monsters, repeat  and the enemy AI is dull-witted at best, removing much challenge on all but the hardest settings.",

    "text": "For some, the school summer holidays are the annual signal to spend a fortune on flights, cottage rentals and family attractions. I&apos;m here to suggest an alternative, a golden opportunity to address the complete disconnection from the real world or, to coin a phrase from across the pond  the &quot;nature deficit disorder&quot; that has blighted at least two generations of young people. With a little bit of thought and imagination there are so many ways to experience the great outdoors - our trees, woods, waterways, coasts and hills are all there to enjoy and no one can doubt the many positive effects of spending time outside as a family. As a father of four I can personally vouch for this. If you&apos;re stuck for ideas, there can be few activities more engaging than creating a bolt-hole in the wilderness (or the bottom of the garden). Kids of all ages will muck in and allow their imagination to fly once you get the ball rolling with a few branches and leaves. However tempting it may be to take over the engineering element of the den-making, make sure it really is the kids that are doing the work, with just a guiding hand coming from you. As an island nation we are blessed with thousands of miles of coastline and the tradition of making the most of it, whatever the weather. On rocky shorelines, time your visit for low tide and equip the kids with waterproof shoes, a bucket and a net. Look for pools with seaweed and help the foraging by lifting flattened rocks. Crabs, prawn and small fish like gobys and blennys are all commonplace and resilient enough to survive for a while in the bucket. Be careful not to mix predators with prey though, or you could end up with just one large crab in your collection! Replace rocks as you found them and put creatures back before you leave the beach. Older kids will enjoy donning a mask and snorkel and peering into the marine world from the safety of the rocks. Ever wondered what was living at the bottom of the garden or what&apos;s wandering outside your caravan, tent or holiday cottage during the hours of darkness? Including kids in the &quot;hunt&quot; for local wildlife, using the latest technology with trail cameras or camera traps is hugely rewarding. Good models work by day and night (using infrared lighting) and can take either still or moving images of anything lurking within the field of view. Identifying the best place to leave the camera (animal trails or an area where a creature has been digging are examples) builds a sense of expectation and the thrill of retrieving and looking at the results can give Christmas morning a run for its money. And finally - nothing helps us connect with nature quite as physically as climbing a tree. I know it&apos;s not politically correct to suggest kids endanger themselves by scrabbling up the nearest oak, but I for one want to start a campaign to encourage responsible tree climbing all over the nation. The golden rules: have three of your limbs in contact with the tree at any one time, test a branch before pulling your body weight onto it, grab branches at the base or rest your foot at the base of a branch. Always consider your route down while you scale the tree. Even if tree climbing is not on the agenda, our woods offer one of the best playgrounds in the nation. Take paper and crayons to make bark rubbings, or simply allow the imagination to run riot with games of hide and seek and make believe. Take inspiration from the Woodland Trust, which uses our woods to inspire and instil a love of nature and the outdoors from an early age. Its Nature Detectives website is full of great free activities for kids or use VisitWoods to find your nearest accessible wood from over 10,000 listed.

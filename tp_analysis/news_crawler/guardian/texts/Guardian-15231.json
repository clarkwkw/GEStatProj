    "headline": "20 best Android apps this week", 
    "text": "It&apos;s time for our weekly roundup of brand new and notable apps for Android smartphones and tablets. It covers apps and games, with the prices referring to the initial download: so (Free) may mean (Freemium) in some cases. The equivalent iOS roundup will be published later in the day. For now, read on for this week&apos;s Android selection (and when you&apos;ve finished, check out previous Best Android apps posts). Marvel Unlimited (Free) Marvel Unlimited is Marvel&apos;s subscription service for its digital comics, with its app having now been ported from iOS to Android. The service costs $9.99 a month in the US, although it&apos;s available worldwide. All-you-can-eat comics is the offer, although initial Google Play reviews indicate Marvel may have some work to do to improve the new app. Say the Same Thing (Free) Say the Same Thing comes on like a cross between Words With Friends and Draw Something, but it&apos;s nothing to do with those games&apos; publisher Zynga. Instead, it&apos;s an official game from band OK Go, which gets you and a friend to enter random words, then guess words that connect them until you both, yes, &quot;say the same thing&quot;. Carmageddon (1.49) Grand Theft Auto games have been on Android for a while, but now another famously-controversial franchise has come roaring onto the platform. Carmageddon is the work of Stainless Games, and revives the race&apos;n&apos;wreck &apos;em up from the late 1990s. Your job is to race 28 opponents while using your car as a weapon against rivals, police and innocent pedestrians in equal measure. WeatherSignal (Free) There are a number of startups working on innovative ways to show the weather in apps. OpenSignal&apos;s newie tries to detect it too: part of &quot;the most ambitious weather crowdsourcing project in the world&quot;. The idea: the app uses various smartphone sensors to record and share local atmospheric readings, while showing you key data. Snoop Lion&apos;s Snoopify! (Free) And from weather apps to a man who knows a lot about, ahem, drizzle. Snoop Lion&apos;s new release is a photo-sharing app called Snoopify, covered in more detail earlier in May. It&apos;s about taking photos, customising them with Snoop-themed virtual stickers, and sharing on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Some stickers are free, but others are bought in packs via in-app purchase. Blitz Brigade (Free) Blitz Brigade is the latest freemium game from publisher Gameloft: a multiplayer first-person shooter for up to 12 players at once to compete over the network. It sees you waging war with more than 100 weapons and five character classes  soldier, gunner, medic, sniper and stealth with 120 training missions to hone your skills. Bespoke Offers (Free) Here comes another hot young startup with a location-based daily deals app. Little-known Barclays Bank is... Wait, what? Yes, that Barclays has a new offers app for Android that promises to showcase discounts from businesses and retailers near your physical location. Focus@Will (Free) Nothing to do with Him From The Black Eyed Peas, this is the official Android app from a digital music service called Focus@Will. As its name implies, it provides music designed to work or study to: carefully-crafted streaming radio stations in genres including classical, jazz, ambient and &quot;alpha chill&quot;. Magic Belles: Magic Music (1.49) More music here, but this time in a children&apos;s app. Already available on iOS, the Android port includes the same mixture of six colourful fairies, each with their own music mini-game or activity to get kids creating sounds. It&apos;s aimed at 3-6 year-olds. Bang With Friends (Free) Definitely NOT one for The Kids, this: an official Android app for the find-out-which-of-your-Facebook-friends-wants-to-have-sex-with-you website. You sign in with Facebook, select which friends you fancy and then get to message any that have also chosen you. &quot;Completely private &amp; discreet until both friends are down to bang,&quot; claims its Google Play listing, although last week The Daily Dot noticed that clicking this link reveals which of your friends are using the service. Android Central - The App (Free) Android Central is one of the most popular Android-focused websites, so its official app is likely to be a hit too. It brings news stories, reviews, podcasts and other content to devices, with YouTube videos, an accessories shop and a feature to tip the site about new stories. Lively (Free) Lively is one of a growing number of apps that scan music blogs for new tunes, then serve them up for mobile devices. This promises new tracks every 10 minutes, and the ability to follow other users and specific artists to keep tabs on the latest music. Splay Launcher (Free) Android homescreen-replacement apps (or &quot;launchers&quot;) are in the news more since the release of Facebook Home earlier in the year. Splay is getting lots of interest this week with its neat swipe&apos;n&apos;lift user interface to provide fast access to your most-used apps and phone features. Fraggle Friends Forever (2.57) Fraggle Rock is back, Back, BACK! Courtesy of Cupcake Digital and The Jim Henson Company, this app marks the Fraggles&apos; debut on Android with a story about Boober coming &quot;face to face with a very big, very hungry, very ticklish Slurp&quot; (kids, ask your parents. In fact, young parents, ask YOUR parents...) Interactive activities include mini-games and colouring. Airplayer (Free) Will Apple ever make an iTunes app for Android? Take one guess... Airplayer is a step in that direction from independent developer Softpersimmon though: an app that &quot;brings Android to Apple&apos;s Airplay/Airtunes family&quot; by streaming audio from iTunes on the desktop to an Android smartphone, tablet or set-top box. Little Learners Play and Learn (Free) This is another app for kids, this time from book publisher Parragon Books. Designed for babies and toddlers, it features cute animals and two free mini-games based on foods and music with two more unlockable through an in-app purchase. Leviathan: Warships (3.24) An entirely more serious affair is Leviathan: Warships from Paradox Interactive. It&apos;s an action-strategy game where you build a fleet of warships then battle friends or team up with them in co-op missions. The fleet-editor section is where games will be won or lost, with naval geekery definitely an advantage. Chuck the Muck (Free) A game called Chuck the Muck featuring a &quot;spunky little blob&quot;? Urban Dictionary would have a field day. This comes from developer KizStudios: a physics-based adventure with plenty of goo, ooze and puzzles to solve. Undead Soccer (1.68) One last game this week: football with shambling zombies (insert own QPR joke here). You play a footballer who, after being sent off, discovers that all the other players, officials and fans have been turned into zombies. To which the only sensible response is to grab a football and dustbin-lid to give them a good shoeing. Flayvr (Free) Our 20th app this week is the latest that wants to help people organise their digital photos and videos collections. In this case, Flayvr &quot;recognises photos and videos taken at the same event and builds a beautiful living collage out of them&quot;, while also sharing to Facebook, Twitter, and/or Google+. That&apos;s this week&apos;s selection, but what do you think? Make your own recommendations, or give your views on the apps above, by posting a comment.",

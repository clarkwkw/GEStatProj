    "text": "This year, more than 1.3 million people will die as a result of road traffic injury. That&apos;s roughly 10 lives lost by the time you finish reading this article. Countless millions will be left with long-term injuries. More than 90% of the victims will live in developing countries. Stopping this carnage is one of the greatest development challenges of our day, yet the sheer scale of the problem is not widely recognised. For adolescents and young adults in developing countries, road traffic injury is now the single biggest cause of death. In Africa, cars and trucks kill more five- to 14-year-old children than killer diseases such as malaria and Aids. Yet the road injury epidemic has yet to register on the international development agenda. Fatality is just the tip of an iceberg. In countries lacking accessible health systems and social welfare safety nets, a road traffic injury is all too often a one-way ticket to poverty. Other costs are beyond estimation. What price do you put on the grief and trauma that comes with the loss of a child, a parent, a sister or a friend? Over the past few months I have seen some of the human tragedy behind the statistics. I&apos;ve spoken in South African townships with mothers who have been robbed of their children. In a Mumbai slum I met 23-year-old Shabir Sheikh, who six years ago was a promising secondary school student with dreams of becoming an engineer. Today, he is living with the limb-shattering injuries he sustained when he got hit by a car on the way home from school. &quot;I can&apos;t work and I can&apos;t afford medical bills: my life finished that day,&quot; he says. The global nature of the crisis is epitomised by the road linking Kenya&apos;s capital Nairobi to the port of Mombasa. Upgraded into an eight-lane superhighway with support from the World Bank and other donors, speed is up and journey times are down. Pity they forgot about the children, hundreds of whom cross the road to get from their homes in the sprawling slum of Kibera to primary school. &quot;It makes me scared every single day,&quot; Mary Kitunga, 12, told me. She had just crossed the road carrying her four-year old brother. For point of reference, try to imagine your kids crossing a motorway to get to school. However dire the situation is today, the future looks much worse. Economic growth and the rise of the middle class in developing countries are increasing demand for cars. Meanwhile, population growth and urbanisation are putting more people  especially children  in harm&apos;s way. In Britain, there is one death for every 10,000 cars on the road. In Brazil, the death ratio is seven times higher, while in China it is 15 times higher. And in India, there are 27 deaths for every 10,000 cars. The death ratio for much of Africa is off the scale. In Nigeria, there are 70 times more deaths on a per-vehicle basis than in Europe. These numbers matter. While car numbers in rich countries are static, sales are booming across Asia and Latin America and rising sharply in Africa. By 2015, India will overtake Germany as the world&apos;s fourth largest market for vehicles. According to the World Health Organisation, the number of people dying on the world&apos;s roads will rise by half a million over the next six years. It doesn&apos;t have to be like this. Design roads that separate cars, trucks and buses from people; enforce laws on helmets, seat belts, speeding and drink-driving; run campaigns that increase public awareness; invest in safe public transport. These are measures that the Commission for Global Road Safety estimates could save 5 million lives and prevent 50m injuries between now and 2020. But attitudes need to change. Bilateral donors, the World Bank and other multilateral development banks are spending billions on road infrastructure, but road safety is too often an afterthought. They should set aside 10% of their project budgets for safety. Car companies talk about road safety, but people come a distant second to profit when they spot a market opportunity. That&apos;s why major multinational companies operate one set of vehicle standards for the US and another for Brazil. Development agencies also have to ask themselves some tough questions, starting with the obvious one. Why isn&apos;t one of the great sources of poverty, human suffering and economic waste on the global campaigning agenda? Two decades ago, the first Rio summit challenged us to rethink our understanding of poverty and the environment. In June, the Rio+20 summit will provide an opportunity to set a new course on transport policy. Putting people before cars isn&apos;t just about saving lives. It&apos;s about heading off a social, ecological and economic disaster. Cars account for one-fifth of CO2 emissions (and rising). Air pollution from vehicles contributes to almost 1 million deaths annually. And just in case you think the car boom is good for growth, think again. The gridlocks paralysing major cities like Delhi, Sao Paolo and Shanghai are wiping out 2% to 3% of their GDP annually. On Monday, the governments and UN agencies planning Rio+20 will meet in New York to finalise the summit agenda. They have a chance to put road safety at the heart of a sustainable transport policy. On behalf of those kids crossing the Mombasa highway, I have one request: don&apos;t blow it.",

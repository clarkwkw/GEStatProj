    "text": "It was one of those evenings of the possible: an open sky, warm ground, moments before sunset. In the weird stillness of an August evening, when there&apos;s no one about, when wheat fields crackle and shush, there&apos;s an invitation. But to what? Above the Edge, lustrous clouds licked pink where swifts left a few days ago. The west firing orange between dark trees of Edge Wood glimpsed from the path skirting fields up the bank. Something in my shoe. I stopped where two paths crossed at the bank top to sort it out. All was still, warm with a wheaty fragrance, then I heard a chickering, chattering sound like swallows and house martins make when throwing jibes at each other. But the sound was stationary and on closer listening, not really bird-like, not at all like small birds darting into a hedge with just a whistle. Looking around, the sound was coming from a beech tree. This was one of the huge, 200-year-old beeches slowly breaking apart over recent years but about half of it remained. A good 60ft tall, reaching across the woods, which plunged over the Edge below its grey, elephantine boughs. The chattering stopped and started again, and as I watched a bat flew from a woodpecker hole in the trunk. It kept high and flew along the wood&apos;s edge, south. Then another and another popped out of the hole. Some flew south, some north, some whipped out across open fields but were only visible for a few seconds. The bats appeared to be leaving in groups, clustering at the hole and making a surprisingly loud chattering before pushing from their winged elbows and launching into the air. There must have been 30or more leaving the roost. It was not quite dark, they were large for British bats, the roost site and behaviour suggested they may have been male noctule bats. I imagined them climbing through dark chambers inside the tree, shrieking as they burst into the gloaming, flying through the sonic world of their hunting air.",

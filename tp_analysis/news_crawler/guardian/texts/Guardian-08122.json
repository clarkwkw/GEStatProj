Councils plan emergency measures including holding classes in converted shops and operating schools in shifts. Shortages are being reported across the country. In July, the Croydon Advertiser reported that the local council may have to find 300 additional reception places in September for children who had not yet had a primary school place confirmed:  Urgent talks have been held with governing bodies across the borough in hope of persuading more schools to take &quot;bulge&quot; classes, many in temporary buildings. Croydon council said the measures were a response to unprecedented demand caused by a &quot;baby boom&quot; and increased inward migration.

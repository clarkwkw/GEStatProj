    "text": "Boris Johnson&apos;s popular fleet of rental bikes have become an unexpected victim of O2&apos;s nationwide outage, as more than 100 bike stations across London were hit by the network blackout. Some Londoners wanting to cycle to work on Thursday morning found they could not operate the Barclays Cycle Hire machines, with almost one in five of the capital&apos;s bike terminals out of commission. But most commuters would not have expected the disruption to have been caused by O2. The bicycle hire machines were affected by the blackout because they use the O2 network to process card payments from customers. Hundreds of thousands of people across the UK have been affected by the blackout, which began at 1.30pm on Wednesday and left customers unable to make calls, send or receive text messages or use mobile data for around 24 hours. O2 said at 11am on Thursday that customers should be able to make and receive calls and that its 2G service was back online. The company said its 3G service, for higher speed mobile internet connections, was restoring gradually. The blackout, which appears to have impacted a small proportion of O2&apos;s 23 million customers across the UK, has had a significant knock-on effect as it provides services to other companies. Customers of Tesco Mobile and giffgaff, two smaller mobile operators, were unable to connect fully as those services are based on O2&apos;s network. Transport for London, which operates the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme, said its bike terminals use O2&apos;s 2G network to process debit and credit card payments from the terminals. Only casual users, those who are after a one-off ride on a pay-as-you-go basis, are thought to have been affected by the Boris bikes blackout. The disruption hit more than 100 terminals across London on Thursday morning, but they slowly came back online as O2 fixed its 2G bug. There are more than 8,000 of the bikes and 570 terminals in the capital. O2 is yet to explain in detail what caused the disruption, other than saying that a network error affected the way mobile phone numbers connect to the system. It follows a number of other high-profile technical failures by vital services, notably the massive failed software update last month by NatWest. A spokesman for O2, which is the UK&apos;s second-biggest mobile network and is owned by Telefonica, was unable to say on Thursday morning whether it would offer compensation to the hundreds of thousands of customers affected.",

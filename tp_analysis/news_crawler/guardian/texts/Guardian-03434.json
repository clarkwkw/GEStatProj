    "text": "Fears are growing that a coalition pledge to enshrine increased aid spending in law could be quietly axed, amid signs that it has been dropped from the forthcoming parliamentary timetable. Several charities expressed concern that a law committing Britain to spending 0.7% of its income on international aid by 2013 is likely to be omitted from next month&apos;s Queen&apos;s speech, which sets out the government&apos;s legislative intentions for the year. Spending 0.7% of GDP is a long-standing UN goal, first mooted in 1970, and all three main UK parties have signed up to it. George Osborne, the chancellor, has allowed for the increase in his budget, from the present 0.54%, but without legislation the percentage could decrease in future budgets. Shadow development secretary, Ivan Lewis, has written to the international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, to remind him of the government&apos;s promise to protect the budget. He said legislation was now a matter of &quot;trust and credibility&quot;. Those against safeguarding it failed &quot;to demonstrate a commitment to social justice or recognise the tremendous results that UK assistance provides but they also ignore the fact that it is in Britain&apos;s national interest to support fragile developing states&quot;, he said. Any back-pedalling from the promise could be embarrassing for David Cameron when he has just scored a political coup, having been invited by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon to chair a new committee on development goals. The committee is tasked with reshaping new targets to follow the present eight millennium development goals, which expire in 2015. Many of them, including halving extreme poverty and halting the spread of HIV/Aids, will be missed, and the 0.7% pledge is crucial to reinstating credibility to a development timetable. The Oxfam health policy adviser Anna Marriott said legislation had to come at the earliest opportunity. &quot;This government deserves real credit for keeping promises  by increasing aid. But we are disappointed that ministers are delaying plans to give legal force to pledges.&quot; Unicef UK&apos;s executive director, David Bull, said it was vital the government kept its promise. &quot;Aid continues to be vital in transforming the lives of the world&apos;s poorest children. The coalition agreement included a commitment to put the 0.7% pledge into law. Many children still die unnecessarily. For their sake, it is vital that this promise is kept, whether or not it is explicitly stated in the Queen&apos;s speech.&quot; A Department for International Development spokesperson insisted a bill was ready. &quot;We will legislate when parliamentary time allows,&quot; he said. An NGO source said: &quot;My understanding is that the Tory backbenchers don&apos;t want House of Lords reform or foreign aid commitments, so putting both in the Queen&apos;s speech would be too much, even if it means missing the 2013 promise.&quot; But a source close to Mitchell insisted: &quot;There&apos;s no question of a coalition split here. The bill is ready to go, subject to parliamentary time and, in the meantime, we&apos;re meeting the coalition&apos;s promises on aid and pressing on with tough reforms to ensure maximum value for money for British taxpayers.&quot; But John Hilary, the executive director of War on Want, said the debate around targets was disingenuous. &quot;The government has bought aid agencies&apos; silence by agreeing to sign up to the 0.7% and whether it does or doesn&apos;t enshrine it in law, it has bought itself an easy ride.&quot; There was a sense of a lie being peddled about quick-fix aid when charities should be scrutinising the government&apos;s policies, rather than begging for cash, he said. &quot;What we should be pressing the government on is how its policies impact on developing countries, how it supports British businesses which cause harm or exploitation. It&apos;s high time so-called development agencies focused on development. We all know pouring in aid isn&apos;t going to bring about real change; it hasn&apos;t done for the past 60 years.&quot; A Labour party source said: &quot;After the debacle of the NHS reforms, if the legislation does not appear in the Queen&apos;s speech, people will conclude that the Tory party&apos;s claims to have changed were a pre-election con. &quot;This is a test of David Cameron&apos;s willingness to face down the rightwing of his own party. Before the election, he used the NHS and overseas aid to demonstrate the Tories had changed. Ensuring the legislation is in the Queen&apos;s speech is a test of his leadership.&quot; Sixteen countries are committed to meeting 0.7% by 2015, while Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden and Luxembourg have surpassed it.",

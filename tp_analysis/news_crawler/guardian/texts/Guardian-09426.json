    "headline": "Tuition fees: have increases left the UK government and taxpayer better off ?", 
    "text": "UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg recently apologised for promising to oppose any increase in tuition fees prior to the last election. Clegg explained that the fee rises  which have been blamed for a 30,000 fall in applications this year  were unavoidable in the current economic climate. So, how much money did it save the government to increase the fee cap to 9,000 per year? Not as much as you might think. In fact, recently published IFS figures estimate the total saving to the taxpayer of the reforms was around 760m. While that is a substantial amount of money, this represents just a 12% taxpayer saving on the previous system. Under the old university funding system, a large proportion of money going to universities came from the taxpayer in the form of the HEFCE teaching grant  money given to each university to teach its students. But by increasing tuition fees  money which also goes directly to universities  the government was able to reduce the HEFCE teaching grant without making universities any worse off. The result of the reforms was that much of the money that the government used to give to universities now comes from students (or rather from graduates, since tuition fees are paid after graduation) instead. The HEFCE teaching grant fell from 11,000 on average per graduate to a mere 460 per graduate in 2012, while contributions from graduates increased from around 17,000 to 26,850 (a 52% increase in graduate contributions). So, given the substantial saving in the taxpayer contribution to universities at the expense of graduates, why are the taxpayer savings not greater than 12%? Aside from the HEFCE teaching grant, the government also contributes to the higher education system through the system of student support. The government pays maintenance grants for poor students  which now amount to an average of 4,500 per graduate  and subsidises student fee and maintenance loans; for every 1 the government loans to students in the form of fee and maintenance loans, a certain proportion is never repaid and must be subsidised by the government. This is because fee and maintenance loans are offered on quite favourable terms  under the old system they were interest free, didn&apos;t have to be repaid until the borrower left university and was earning more than 15,000 per year. Even then they were only paid off at 9% of earnings above this threshold, and written off after 25 years. Under this system, the public sector subsidy on student support was estimated at 25%  in other words, for every 1 loaned to students for fee and maintenance loans, the taxpayer had to pay out 25p. Loan repayment terms are still very generous under the new system. Though an interest rate has been added, the repayment threshold and length of the loan have been increased. And because loans are even bigger than before (driven by the near-threefold increase in tuition fee loans), even more money will remain unpaid and have to be covered by the taxpayer. In fact, the subsidy increased to around 33p for every 1 loaned. The upshot is that increasing fees to 9,000 per year actually cost the taxpayer money. It&apos;s only after taking into account the reduced HEFCE grant that the government will eventually make a saving  about 2,500 per graduate, or 760m per year. So the taxpayer contribution to higher education is still substantial  amounting to around 18,000 per graduate  but this is now almost entirely made up of maintenance grants, and unpaid fee and maintenance loans. Given the continuing cost to the government of the higher education system, they may not be too concerned about the fall in student numbers this year.

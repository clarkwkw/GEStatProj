Question: This adorable Australian mystery bird has a strange behaviour that seems not to make any sense -- until you realise what it eats. What behaviour is that? Why does this bird show this behaviour? Do any other birds also have this behaviour? Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is an adult Australasian grebe, Tachybaptus novaehollandiae, in their bright breeding plumage. This small waterbird is placed into Podicipedidae; the grebes.  Like most grebes, the Australasian grebe is a poor flier and even worse on land due to its short wings and its legs being placed far back on its body. Here&apos;s a video of a preening Australasian grebe in Dryandra Woodlands State Forest that gives you a good look at its very short wings:             [video link]. Grebes have large feet with flat rounded &quot;lobate&quot; toes and small webs between their front three toes, which adapts them well to a life of diving and swimming underwater. In fact, they are excellent swimmers and divers, and when threatened, they typically sink out of sight underwater and then swim away undetected.  Interestingly, even the tiny hind toe has a small lobe. Recent experimental work has shown that these lobes act like hydrofoil blades on a propeller. Thanks to the wonders of convergent evolution, this character is shared with the totally unrelated bird, the extinct Hesperornithiformes, that lived in the Cretaceous. Grebes&apos; sinking ability is aided by their unusual plumage. It is dense and waterproof, and the underside of the feathers are at right-angles to the skin, allowing the birds to trap large air bubbles so they float. When grebes press their feathers against the body, these bubbles are released and their buoyancy is reduced. They sink. The Australasian grebe is common on fresh water ponds and small rivers or lakes throughout most of Australia, New Zealand and on the nearby islands. They eat small fish and aquatic insects. In winter, adult birds have dark greyish-brown upperparts and mostly silvery-grey underparts and a white oval patch of bare skin at the base of the bill when in non-breeding plumage. Breeding plumage is considerably brighter: the head is glossy-black with a rufous or chestnut stripe that extends from just behind the eye to the base of the neck, the eye is gold and the patch of bare skin at the base of the bill is pale yellow. Males and females look the same.  When breeding, grebes conceal their floating nests amongst reeds on the surface of the water. The chicks can swim at birth. A peculiar habit that grebes have is they eat their feathers and feed them to their young. Although it is not known with certainty why they do this, several hypotheses have been proposed, including; to prevent injury from swallowed fish bones; to assist with pellet formation; and to reduce their vulnerability to gastric parasites. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

    "text": "Google is marking Halloween with an interactive doodle that animates some spooky happenings on a street where assorted ghouls and creatures are brought to life by users clicking on four front doors. The inhabitants behind the doors, including a central one which is suitably numbered 13, double up to form the letters of the Google logo. They include a blue one-eyed octopus, which stands for &apos;G&apos;, a pair of red and yellow eyes which provide the two &apos;Os&apos; and a veiled ghost which forms the second &apos;G&apos;. A skeleton is the &apos;L&apos; while a smiley face that turns into a monster represents the &apos;E&apos;. An eerie soundtrack plays in the background, although those of a nervous disposition can turn the sound off. The Guardian has set up a Halloween Flickr group following on from the fun last year when readers posted pictures of their ghoulish gourds and creative costumes. To share your pictures, join the group here and upload your image to the group pool. Readers on Pinterest can also share a pin of their creation by including the hashtag #guardianhalloween in the description. The best will be collated in a Halloween pinboard.",

    "text": "For years, Electronic Arts&apos; Need For Speed franchise reminded one of the musical output of Simon Cowell: utterly lacking in merit and derided by critics, yet incredibly popular as a result of assiduously inescapable marketing. Then EA purchased Guildford-based developer Criterion, developer of the much-loved Burnout games, which turned its irresistible talents to 2010&apos;s Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, which finally brought some genuine classiness to proceedings, with the result that Hot Pursuit is still played today. Criterion&apos;s second bite of the Need For Speed cherry takes the name and vague format from 2005&apos;s Most Wanted but, as any gamer would hope, has more in common with Burnout. So to describe it as much-anticipated would be to understate.     Everything in Most Wanted is geared towards encouraging you to explore Fairhaven, which is fine, since it looks drop-dead gorgeous  even the grotty bits.    Luckily, Criterion has honed the art of making arcade-racers to such a rarefied level over the years that Most Wanted justifies the hype with almost contemptuous ease. It takes place in one of Criterion&apos;s famed American cities, Fairhaven, which is bigger and richer than any of its previous ones, with jumps galore, elevated freeway sections, docks that are basically sandboxes for hooligans and so on. Your overarching mission is to join the ranks of the 10 most-wanted street-racers in Fairhaven, then work your way up to being a four-wheeled public enemy number one. This is achieved by amassing speed points by winning races, achieving challenges and driving like a nutcase  pulling off drifts, slipstreaming, escaping the cops&apos; attentions, smashing billboards, passing speed-cameras at unfeasibly high speeds, to name but a few. Unusually, the game&apos;s array of incredibly desirable machinery, old and new, is unlocked from the moment you start the game, but there&apos;s a twist: you have to find it. Cars you can acquire are located at &quot;Jacking Points&quot; throughout Fairhaven, and when you come across them, you can simply jump into them.     Each car has its own set of races, and if you win them or come second, you don't just get speed points, but car upgrades.    Each car has its own set of races, and if you win them or come second, you don&apos;t just get speed points, but car upgrades like nitrous (always the prize for winning the easiest race on offer), off-road and racing tyres, lightweight and strengthened bodies, aero kits and much more. You can swap in upgrades according to the type of race. To race, you select one from a menu and the mini-map displays your route to its start  everything in Most Wanted is geared towards encouraging you to explore Fairhaven, which is fine, since it looks drop-dead gorgeous. It&apos;s grimy in places, picturesque in others, and will have you marvelling at how developers have got to grips with milking every ounce of graphics-processing power at this late stage of the console cycle. Stock races are point-to-point affairs with checkpoints delineated by white poles (the circuit-defining chevrons from Burnout are mostly absent). There are ambush races, in which you must escape from the cops as quickly as possible and circuit races that take place both on and off-road. Speed runs pit you against yourself, forcing you to achieve an average-speed target over each course (so you must avoid crashing or being taken down by the cops). Burnout&apos;s ability to perform take-downs (or be taken down yourself) is present and correct, and crashes are shown in spectacular glory, although unlike Burnout, you aren&apos;t rewarded for crashing spectacularly. Car handling gives you loads of feel, and there is a sense of realism in the handling, yet you would still describe it as arcade-style: braking into corners without lifting the throttle triggers massive (and unrealistic) drifts. The best races, though, are those in which you take on the Most Wanted drivers. They&apos;re satisfyingly long, and you&apos;re up against skilled drivers in very exotic machinery. And the police are on your case from the start, setting up roadblocks, calling in battering-ram SUVs and dropping tyre-shredders (luckily, you can drive through garages, instantly fixing your car and changing its colour).     Say hello to Fairhavens traffic police, the most cowboyish, persistent bunch you're ever likely to come across in a racing game.    Fairhaven&apos;s traffic police are the most persistent, not to mention cowboyish, on Earth, and they will gang up on you for the slightest driving-law violation, even if you&apos;re just indulging in some open-world cruising. Most Wanted is also gloriously meaty. It boasts an even more clever version of Autolog, the system which sets you challenges according to what your online friends have been doing (and more random ones even if you have no online friends). The multiplayer is great: setting up races against friends is a breeze, and it&apos;s incredibly easy to jump into sets of races with and against strangers: the game shepherds you to meeting points and has you doing imaginative things like surpassing a collective distance-target for jumps off the roof of a building. Criterion has done it again, setting a new standard for arcade-style racing games which won&apos;t be surpassed until the next generation of consoles has been on sale for a while. It actually leaves one feeling a bit sorry for Forza Horizon, which is a very good game, and infinitely superior to its predecessors. But Need For Speed: Most Wanted is, by whatever criteria you may see fit to apply, a great game.  Need For Speed: Most Wanted was reviewed on the Xbox 360",

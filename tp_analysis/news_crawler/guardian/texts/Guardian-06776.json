    "text": "Three activists were found guilty at Preston magistrates court on Tuesday on charges of aggravated trespass and assault after occupying a fracking rig in a Lancashire protest last year. In November 2011, Lauren Pepperell, Barbara Anne Cookson and Edward Lloyd-Davies of the Frack Off campaign group entered a test-drilling site owned by energy company Cuadrilla at Hesketh Bank in Lancashire. They occupied the rig and prevented it from operating. The three were arrested and charged with aggravated trespass. Cookson and Lloyd-Davies were also charged with assault. All three were today sentenced to two-year conditional discharges and a fine of 750 each. According to testimony from Cuadrilla, the 10-hour occupation cost half a day&apos;s work, and about 20,000 due to lost time. A month later another group of activists occupied the same site. Three people from that action have also been charged with aggravated trespass and are awaiting trial. The defendants in the current case argued that their actions were justified as part of the wider issue of climate change. &quot;If it wasn&apos;t for people putting pressure on like this, the issue would get no attention at all,&quot; said Pepperell. &quot;Big corporations are allowed to get away with destroying and polluting the environment and anyone who tries to stop them is just criminalised.&quot; A statement issued by Cuadrilla said: &quot;We note today&apos;s verdict and thank Lancashire constabulary for their help. We take the safety of our staff very seriously and we will continue to conduct our business in a safe and responsible manner. The verdict of assault passed today to two of the accused reveals the wholly unacceptable protest tactics of a tiny and unrepresentative minority. &quot;We will continue to engage with the local community in a straightforward and open fashion, explaining what we are doing, why and how, listening and responding to any concerns and outlining the benefits we believe a safe and well run operation can bring to the region.&quot; Some local residents supported the activists. Doreen Stopforth told the court that she had &quot;looked out of her window one morning, and there was the rig&quot;. She later told the Guardian: &quot;We&apos;ve lived here for 39 years and there was no notice or consultation at all. We walked down to investigate and eventually found a small A4 notice on a lamp post down a private road. They&apos;re putting up a wind turbine nearby and we&apos;ve had notice about that, so why not the drilling?&quot; During the trial the local council confirmed that no environmental impact assessment had been conducted as part of the application. &quot;Fracking&quot;, the process of fracturing shale rock by pumping water, sand and chemicals underground to release gas, has become increasingly controversial. A report by experts commissioned by Cuadrilla suggested two small earthquakes in Blackpool in 2011 were due to shale gas exploration. In his submission to the trial, John Broderick of the Tyndall Centre, one of the authors of a key report into shale gas, said he had concluded that &quot;exploitation of shale gas is incompatible with avoiding dangerous climate change&quot;. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency is currently carrying out an investigation into fracking. In the UK, the Department of Energy and Climate Change is reviewing the issue. The anti-fracking movement is gathering strength in both the US and the UK. On 8 July nearly 100 activists from Earthfirst!, the US environmental direct action network, blocaded a fracking site in Pennsylvania for a day. On Monday this week three activists were arrested during a protest in Ohio. There have also been anti-fracking demonstrations in Cape Town, South Africa, and in Wellington, New Zealand. In the UK last year Nathan Roberts became the first anti-fracking campaigner to be convicted, after he was charged with aggravated trespass for taking part in an banner drop from Blackpool Tower.",

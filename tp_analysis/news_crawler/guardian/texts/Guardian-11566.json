    "text": "   Inside the Brain, the Spring 2013 issue of Big Picture. Download the PDF.     Big Picture is a free educational magazine aimed at A-level teachers and students, published twice a year by the Wellcome Trust. The latest issue, which was written mostly by myself, has just been published and is now available online or for download as a PDF.  It&apos;s all about the imaging technologies used to study brain structure and function  techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electro- encephalography (EEG)  and how they are used in research labs and clinics.  The issue comes with a wealth of additional multimedia resources, including articles, image galleries, videos, animations and games. The Wellcome Trust has also developed an accompanying Big Picture app, which helps students explore the social and ethical questions about brain research and share their views with peers. Here&apos;s an online demo, which asks the question &apos;Is it OK to enhance brain function with cognitive enhancers?&apos; (I wrote the content for the app, too, and I&apos;ve also just written an article called &apos;The Neuroethics of smart drugs&apos; for the Dana Foundation.) The striking photograph on the cover of the magazine was taken by Robert Ludlow, a medical photographer at the Institute of Neurology, and won the 2012 Wellcome Image Awards. It shows the brain of an epileptic patient who was being evaluated before a neurosurgical procedure to remove the abnormal tissue causing the seizures.",

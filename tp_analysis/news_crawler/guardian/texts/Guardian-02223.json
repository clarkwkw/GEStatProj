    "text": "The official literacy target in primary schools should be raised, according to the chief inspector of schools, who warns that the current benchmark is too low to ensure success at GCSE. At present children are expected to reach &quot;level four&quot; in tests at the end of primary school. In English this means they are &quot;active&quot; readers who are capable of visualising the meaning of a text. They should also be able to write extended sentences and use commas. Hundreds of primaries are failing to reach the existing target, and those that have been underperforming for years face a change of management. The head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, will say in a speech on Thursday that schools should be more ambitious. He will say: &quot;It&apos;s important to note that even achieving the current benchmark at the end of primary school is no guarantee of success. &quot;Last year 45% of those pupils who just reached level 4c at the age of 11 did not achieve a grade C in their GCSE English exams. So one of the first questions we need to ask is whether the national end-of-primary-school target of level 4 is sufficiently high to provide an adequate foundation for success at secondary school.&quot; The latest league tables show that 1,310 primary schools in England fell below the expected standards in tests taken last May, while about 150 schools have been below the &quot;floor standard&quot; for five years. In his speech, the chief inspector will underline the extent of poor literacy: last year, 100,000 pupils did not achieve the expected literacy levels by the end of primary school. One in seven adults lacks basic literacy. An Ofsted report published on Thursday finds that since 2008, there has been no overall improvement in primary pupils&apos; English learning. The report notes: &quot;Many primary teachers  understandably, since most are not subject specialists  have a very limited understanding of the world of literature, including good-quality contemporary literature. &quot;For example, over half the teachers involved in the research could name only one, two or no poets at all.&quot; The lack of subject knowledge makes it difficult for them to identify more challenging books to study with older children, the report says. It also means they are less able to teach children grammar, or explain the difference between standard English and slang. Wilshaw is expected to say: &quot;There can be no more important subject than English. It is at the heart of our culture and literacy skills are crucial to pupils&apos; learning for all subjects. Yet too many pupils fall behind in their literacy early on. In most cases, if they can&apos;t read securely at seven they struggle to catch up as they progress through their school careers.&quot; Wilshaw is proposing ten steps to improve literacy. These include urging the government to raise the target for the end of primary school. He will also say that schools should report to parents on their child&apos;s reading age. From September, Ofsted will prioritise inspections of schools with the lowest achievement levels in literacy. Wilshaw will also place greater emphasis on inspectors hearing children read when they visit schools. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: &quot;We want to raise standards in English as a matter of urgency and we are currently looking at this as part of our review of the national curriculum. &quot;Having a strong grasp of literacy needs to start with the youngest pupils  which is why we are introducing phonic screen checks at the end of year 1. &quot;We want England to move back up the international league tables and for children to leave school with the knowledge that will stand them in good stead for their future careers and adult life.&quot;",

    "text": "I wanted to do something for Comic Relief. I have always endeavoured to show the humorous side of science in my myriad works, and rumour has it I sometimes succeed [citation needed]. Since the last time Comic Relief happened, I&apos;ve managed to obtain my own dedicated blog on the Guardian Science network, the one you&apos;re reading now (possibly by accident).  But despite having access to this ill-deserved moderately-high-profile platform, the question of how to use it to raise money for Comic Relief still remained. The general consensus seems to be that the things you do to raise money for Comic Relief should be a) challenging, and b) amusing, or at least an attempt at being amusing. This is tricky to manage in the Guardian Science section. For one, scientific literature on humour and comedy is relatively sparse, and what there is of it is, as you might expect, not funny at all.  Add to this the fact that writing a blog, although often tricky, isn&apos;t what most people would consider &quot;challenging&quot;. It can be, as demonstrated by the mighty Michael Legge&apos;s 25 hour non-stop blogging marathon earlier this week. But even if I were willing/able to attempt some ill-advised herculean blogging endurance test (which I&apos;m not), I&apos;m pretty sure the Guardian website (third most popular news site in the world as of June 2012) would not be keen on letting me abuse its resources to do it. So, I&apos;m going to do what any good scientist would when faced with a tricky problem. I&apos;m going to ask others for help. Science is invariably done best in collaboration, so here&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do. In honour of Red Nose Day&apos;s 25th anniversary, the first 25 people to sponsor me get to choose a subject. It can be anything you like as long as it&apos;s not a) offensive or b) illegal (I may be doing this for charity; the Guardian legal team is not). Once I&apos;ve got enough subjects, I&apos;ll do my very best to combine them all into a science blog and post it here on Friday 15 March, the day of Comic Relief. It will probably be the most incoherent, illogical and nonsensical science blog ever posted on the site (and that&apos;s saying something), but I&apos;ll be donating all the revenue I get via web traffic to the sponsorship total, so you can give money to charity just by reading it (although it may not be worth it). I may well fail in my attempt to combine 25 disparate subjects into a coherent science blog, but that should provide a good laugh at the very least.  Here are some of the rules of this bizarre challenge: 1. Here&apos;s my sponsorship page. The first 25 people to sponsor get to pick a subject I have to incorporate into the final blog. There is no minimum sponsorship required and it&apos;s first come first served. Once there are 25 subjects provided, you will be unable to make suggestions, but you can still sponsor if you wish. 2. If you donate, you can leave your name and the web address of anything you&apos;d like to have a link to (website, blog, twitter feed etc). You can remain anonymous if you wish, but if you donate too late to pick a subject, you can still get a mention in the final blog if you leave your details. 3. Suggestions and names/link details can be left in comments on the sponsorship page. 4. Anything deemed offensive or legally questionable posted as either subject suggestions or link requests will not be considered. So there we go. If the set-up is this confusing, imagine what the end result is going to be like.  Ah, science!  UPDATE: 25 people have now sponsored and provided subjects. You can still sponsor and get a mention, but no more subject choices will be accepted. Dean Burnett&apos;s sponsorship page is here. You can track his efforts to give himself brain sprain while doing this via Twitter, @garwboy",

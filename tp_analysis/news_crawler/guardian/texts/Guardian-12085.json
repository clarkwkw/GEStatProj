    "text": "Last year&apos;s Ninja Gaiden 3 enjoyed a mixed reception at best. With former series head Tomonobu Itagaki absent, it was perceived to have softened, been made more accessible, less demanding and, most sinfully, easier. In this enhanced Wii U version, super-ninja Ryu Hayabusa&apos;s globe-trotting battle against the Lords of Alchemy cult remains the same, but there&apos;s a distinctive spike in difficulty. Where players could formerly progress at a steady pace through button-bashing, Razor&apos;s Edge demands far more precision, timed defences against enemy attacks and lightning-fast retaliations. Extra modes, including the online Shadows of the World, and bonus missions for female ninja Ayane (among others) add considerably more playing time to the package. However, while the content is significantly improved, the Wii U gamepad often feels ill-designed for it. Touchscreen controls for special attacks or swapping weapons complement, rather than replace, the physical button commands, and reaching over to activate them feels less intuitive than hammering out a combo. The bulkier pad also proves less than ideal for the more challenging combat, meaning some will prefer to stick with the flawed earlier release.",

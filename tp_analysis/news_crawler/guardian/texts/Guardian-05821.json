    "text": "John Hilary has argued on this site that David Cameron seems the &quot;worst possible choice&quot; to join the UN panel on replacing the millennium development goals (MDGs). Although Hilary raises some valid points  not least the UK&apos;s opposition to the financial transaction tax  his position fails to recognise the opportunity Cameron&apos;s appointment presents. Cameron will co-chair Ban Ki-moon&apos;s panel at the same time as he chairs the G8 in 2013, when the UK is due to deliver its 0.7% aid promise, and when the country will co-chair the Open Government Partnership (OGP). For those of us in Britain who care strongly about tackling the injustice of extreme poverty, the prime minister will be in an incredible position, the opportunities inherent in which we must maximise. There are promising signs that the prime minister&apos;s appointment to these international roles could help to spur a final push to achieve the MDGs and set the tone for the next era of development, one that looks forward  for the first time  to the day when aid is no longer needed. Cameron is one of the few leaders set to keep his promise to increase spending on international aid to 0.7% of national income  and he has not shied away from defending this position, despite criticism in parts of the media. Of course, we have yet to see that commitment in legislation. On his watch, the Department for International Development&apos;s (DFiD) commitment to transparency and aid effectiveness has continued. One of this government&apos;s first acts was to introduce an aid transparency guarantee to provide taxpayers and aid recipients with more information about the use of UK aid. Cameron also successfully persuaded foreign governments to step up their support for childhood vaccines last year, and matched this with a significant pledge from the UK that will save 1.4 million lives in the next four years. When assessing Cameron&apos;s record on development, we can&apos;t ignore these actions. If we&apos;re asking what Cameron will bring to these new roles, it is not just his past record but his emerging vision about the future of development that deserves consideration. He speaks often about the &quot;golden thread&quot; that binds together three strands of effective development: the promotion of individual rights and freedoms; the fight against corruption; growth of the private sector. This implies a strong focus on jobs and justice, on growth with good governance. It risks being quite abstract, but here are three ways he can use his three roles to ensure the thread leads to justice for the poorest. First, as G8 chair the PM should build on the food security and nutrition initiative launched last week. Cameron has signalled his intention to do this with a hunger summit during the Olympics. His focus on growth and governance will be vital to the success of this plan. Such an approach would ensure that all promises  from African governments, as well as from donors and the private sector  are kept through transparent and accountable budgets. It would rigorously monitor progress towards the goal of lifting 50 million people out of poverty, and a further goal of beating back malnutrition. By focusing on growth, the PM can also respond to demands from Africa that we change the perception and reality of agriculture in the region, assisting its transformation from subsistence family farms to thriving family firms. Second, Cameron can work with his co-chairs, Liberia&apos;s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Indonesia&apos;s Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, to radically open up the process around the new MDGs. It&apos;s not the 1990s, when the original goals were devised. Increasingly, the world&apos;s poorest are able to chime in with their thoughts  so let&apos;s make sure they are asked about the new MDGs through a proper poll. Research suggests people living below the poverty line respond that they want jobs and justice. Cameron would do well to listen to them. If they are included in designing the new goals, those who were formerly marginalised will be in a better position to drive the whole process of development with dignity. Finally, Cameron should take advantage of the UK&apos;s position as co-chair of the OGP. With 60 countries already signed up to its bold agenda of making government better, its influence should not be underestimated. Unfortunately, the UK&apos;s stint as co-chair has got off to a shaky start with a slip-up on legislation to increase the transparency of the oil, gas and minerals sector. The UK is not fully supporting key details in the EU legislation to force extractives companies to make public what they pay to governments, such as the importance of ensuring payments are disclosed on a project-by-project level. Such detail is vital to allow citizens to hold governments to account for the wealth generated by natural resources in their countries. If governments are encouraged to promote transparent use of natural resources and public finances, it will bring forward the day when foreign aid is no longer needed. Here, Hilary is absolutely right to argue Cameron must not undermine developing countries&apos; ability to collect taxes and revenues from businesses operating within their borders. Cameron doesn&apos;t have a perfect record, but there are reasons to be optimistic that he will be able to use his international roles to deliver positive change for the poorest people. With these steps, Cameron&apos;s &quot;golden thread&quot; of development could lead to a new era of transparent and accountable financing for development, one in which all financing of the fight against extreme poverty  from foreign aid and natural resources revenues to national tax revenues and investment from businesses  is scrutinised equally for results for and by the poorest. The British prime minister has been handed three roles affording him unprecedented power in the fight against the injustice of extreme poverty. We must now make sure he lives up to his responsibility and rhetoric.",

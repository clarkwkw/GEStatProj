    "headline": "Poecilobothrus nobilitatus Glittering green fly", 
    "text": "Description A small, pretty fly with a lime green thorax. The male has conspicuous white wing tips. Ecology The male performs a courtship display where the conspicuously marked wings are raised and lowered, a bit like an airport marshaller guiding a plane to a parking spot with a pair of batons. Wingspan is directly related to body size, so the better (or bigger) the display, the healthier the male. Distribution Widely distributed.

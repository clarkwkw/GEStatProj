    "text": "The zealous guardians of the two small nature reserves near the school I teach in don&apos;t really want children to visit (Comment, 20 November). One will only allow groups of up to six, which is difficult to staff and timetable for a whole class, and in the other, we are only welcome if engaged in a &quot;learning experience&quot;. Children can&apos;t explore the hedgerows, run through the long grass or lie on their tummies by the pond unless being led by a teacher. The very land these people are so bent on preserving will have no meaning for the next generation if they have not been allowed to meet it on their own, childish terms, making their own &quot;learning experiences&quot;.Annabel GibbYork  Given the choice, young people will choose exploring, climbing, crawling and even drawing over sitting in front of a TV screen at home, and our education team sees 20,000 children a year given that opportunity. For some of these children, who learn about the birds, insects, snakes, plants and trees that live on the heath, their only prior experience of the natural world has been looking at it from a bus but we find they benefit socially, physically and emotionally from spending time outside and learning for themselves how to play in, explore and respect the natural environment. Ash dieback and oak processionary moth are major challenges for the UK&apos;s trees and a reminder of how valuable are our green spaces. Getting children switched on to the benefits of our great urban outdoors will inspire them to take up these challenges in the future.Jeremy SimonsCity of London Corporation Hampstead Heath management committee",

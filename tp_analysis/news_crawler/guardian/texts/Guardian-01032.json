    "text": "What youll learnEngineering degrees cover all things related to developing, providing and maintaining the infrastructure, products and services that society needs - from researching how to manufacture a product to building bridges and roads. Students will study all, or part, of the life cycle of a product, from conception and design to creation. Science and maths will be the core ingredients, but you will be required to be innovative and know how to use your creative flair within a legal and ethical framework, and in budget. You will specifically touch on geology and areas of construction, such as surveying. There is a heavy emphasis on maths in a civil engineering degree, so if you dont love the subject already, youll need to learn to. Taking into consideration environmental impact forms an important part of todays training. You will study the creation and maintenance of infrastructure - such as designing, building and maintaining roads, bridges, railway lines, energy systems, flood defences, water supply and sewage systems. It is a vital area of engineering - without civil engineers it would be much harder to get to work in the morning, travel to see friends, heat your homes or get clean water from the tap.  Its an extremely important field. The provision and maintenance of sustainable and efficient infrastructure is directly linked to economic growth - society, and indeed business, cannot operate without it.   interactive   How youll learnYoull learn through a combination of lectures, tutorials and workshops, as well as practical sessions in the lab or computer workshops. Most courses will encourage you to get hands-on experience by pursuing a project. Through this, youll learn the practical steps of taking your ideas from the drawing board to the real world. Youll learn how to solve problems and overcome obstacles, particularly when it comes to considering the social and ethical difficulties your work could create. Engineering will involve plenty of teamwork, so youll acquire the ability to argue your ideas, analyse those of others and work towards a common goal. Most courses have strong links with industry, so theres a chance that you might work on real-world problems or complete work placements as part of your course. What are the entry requirements?Entry requirements vary. Russell group universities will require maths, and in many cases, physics. Further maths, chemistry, biology, computing or computer science, design technology or geography could also prove useful.   interactive   What job can I get?Theres a high employment rate for civil engineers. You might find a job in a consulting or contracting engineering firm, or in a construction company. Some graduates work in a local authority or in central government. Because of the practical nature of the degree, you will have the tools to pretty much get on with the job straight away. Civil engineering skills are highly transferable and some graduates move into other fields that require project management skills.",

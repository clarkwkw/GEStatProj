Another expert, however, said Microsoft needs to keep up with the technology Joneses, and is certainly able to do more than one thing at a time.  That fence sure is comfy. Study: many searchers choose Google over Bing even when Google&apos;s name is on Bing&apos;s results &gt;&gt; Search Engine Land  In a recent study by SurveyMonkey examining SEO assumptions, respondents were given two search result pages, one with a page header labeled &quot;Google&quot; and the other with a page header labeled &quot;Bing,&quot; and asked which page of results they preferred. Even when the page header labels were swapped, more users preferred the Google search results. Of 641 survey respondents, 379 participants received a survey asking which of two search result pages they preferred. One page of results for the term &quot;file taxes&quot; included true Google results and the other page included true Bing results. The Google page was chosen by majority of the respondents.

The changing web platform landscape: more fragmentation? &gt;&gt; Adobe Digital Media Blog  In this new web platform landscape, what about Adobe&apos;s contributions to open source browsers? What impact does additional browser fragmentation has on Adobe&apos;s efforts? Adobe contributes to standards in open browser implementations for many reasons. One of them is that our new generation Edge tools use a &apos;web design surface&apos;. For well over a year now, we have chosen to use the Chromium Embeded Framework (CEF) to provide this &apos;web design surface&apos;. So naturally, we will contribute to Blink since it is now the core engine that powers CEF. Another reason for contributing to open browsers is to accelerate the availability of new features on the web. This is why we collaborate with Mozilla on a number of standards and contribute code to Gecko (like this patch on masking for canvas). And this is why we will also contribute to WebKit, in addition to Blink, now that the two are separate projects.  Singapore&apos;s NFC sign-ups are &quot;slow&quot; - report &gt;&gt; Mobile World Live  The rate at which mobile subscribers are signing up for NFC-based services in Singapore is &quot;slow&quot;, according to a report in the Straits Times. Since last August about 15,000 users have upgraded to NFC-based SIM cards that enable mobile payments, sources told the publication. Singapore has adopted a model whereby the country&apos;s three mobile operators  SingTel, M1 and Starhub  have built a shared NFC infrastructure with partners in a government-backed approach.Although the underlying infrastructure is shared, the operators offer competitive retail services which they launched last summer. Of the 15,000 figure, around half paid to upgrade their SIM cards to NFC, while the rest were given the cards as part of promotions.

Taiwan probes Samsung &apos;dirty tricks&apos; vs HTC&apos; &gt;&gt; AFP  Taiwanese authorities said Monday they had launched an investigation into allegations that South Korean tech giant Samsung hired students to post malicious comments about local rival HTC online. &quot;The case was set up last week after we received complaints,&quot; Fair Trade Commission spokesman Sun Lih-chyun told AFP. He said the probe would look into allegations that Samsung engaged in false advertising and that if the allegations were upheld, Samsung and its local advertising agent could face a fine of up to Tw$25 million ($835,000). Complaints emerged this month, with internet users alleging that Samsung, through its local agent, had hired students to write online articles attacking HTC and recommending Samsung cellphones, the United Evening News said in a statement on its Facebook page, www.facebook.com/SamsungTaiwan, Samsung Taiwan said it regretted &quot;any inconvenience and confusion from the Internet event&quot;. &quot;Samsung Taiwan has halted all internet marketing such as posting articles on websites,&quot; it said. Samsung was fined Tw$300,000 by the commission earlier this year for a misleading advertisement about the camera functions on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Y Duos GT-S6102, according to Taiwan&apos;s state Central News Agency.  Gosh. iPhone 6 &gt;&gt; Marco.org Marco Arment, Instapaper developer, on naming:   A year later, when Apple did release a model named &quot;iPhone 5&quot; that was far better than the 4S and had an external redesign, the inertia of Apple pessimism was so strong and the press had become such petulant children about Apple products that they shat all over it even though it was a huge update that gave them everything they asked for, plus more. Now, Apple pessimism is even stronger. No matter what they release and no matter how well it sells, they won&apos;t win over the press, the pundits, the stock market, or the rhetoric. Not this year. They could release a revolutionary 60-inch 4K TV for $99 with built-in nanobots to assemble and dispense free smartwatches, and people would complain that it should cost $49 and the nanobots aren&apos;t open enough.  You built what?!: A tractor for the apocalypse &gt;&gt; Popular Science  Seeking a fresh start, [Marcin] Jakubowski bought 30 acres of Missouri farmland and a tractor. Life in relative seclusion proved uneventful until, one day in 2008, his tractor broke down for the second and last time, spurring him to start an open-source industrial revolution. To Jakubowski, the tractor seemed designed to fail. Why should he sink more money into fixing it or buy a replacement? He wanted a simple and useful machine, and one he could repair and upgrade on the fly. &quot;It boiled down to lower cost in the long run,&quot; he says. Jakubowski built the first LifeTrac, as he calls his DIY tractor, in three months for $6,000about $30,000 less than a comparable mass-produced model. Seeing room for improvement, he built a second prototype in just six days. He posted his progress on the tractor and other machines to an online wiki, which attracted followers, who suggested their own design tweaks. Some even visited in person to help with builds  and Open Source Ecology took off.  (Thanks @HotSoup for the link.) Code Hard or Go Home &gt;&gt; Hypercritical  Some people wonder how Google can possibly have any power in the Android ecosystem if the source code is free. Facebook Home has been cited as an example of Google&apos;s ineffectualness. Look at how one of Google&apos;s fiercest enemies has played it for a fool, they say. Google did all the hard work, then Facebook came in at the last minute and co-opted it all for its own purposes. But look again at the graphs above. Now imagine similar graphs for the Android source code. Any company with Android-based products that wants to be truly free from Google&apos;s control has to be preparedand ableto match Google&apos;s output. Operating systems don&apos;t write themselves; platforms don&apos;t maintain themselves; developers need tools and support; technology marches on. It&apos;s not enough just to just fix bugs and support new hardware. To succeed with an Android fork, a company has to drive development in the same way that Apple did when it spawned WebKit from KHTML, just as Google is doing as it forks Blink from WebKit.

Animoca: Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab 2 line and the Kindle Fire family are still the most popular Android tablets worldwide &gt;&gt; Android Police  According to the firm  which distributes games and entertainment apps  the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is the top Android tablet with 11.8% of its network, followed closely by the 10.1 model of the same line. Following that is the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Fire HD which collectively make up another 12.4% of Animoca&apos;s users. All told, before we get to the fan-favorite Nexus 7, a whopping 37.3% of the market has already gone to Samsung and Amazon (the former of which has plenty more share with other, less popular devices). So, what&apos;s the deal? Those of us who live in the Nexus bubble would assume the Nexus 7 [with 3.8% of the Android market] would be the most popular, right? Well, funny story. As of right now, Google&apos;s seven inch slate is available in just ten countries. Only five of those have the 3G variant available. Granted, this only examines Play Store availability, but the offerings are still pretty sparse.  &quot;All data obtained from individual users of Animoca games worldwide who used Google Play and who played an Animoca game on a tablet device between February 18 and March 20, 2013.&quot; Sample size: 978,000.

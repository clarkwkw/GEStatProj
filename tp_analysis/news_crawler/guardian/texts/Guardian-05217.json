    "text": "    This week&apos;s element is indium, which is represented by the symbol, In, and the atomic number, 49. It is a soft, malleable, lustrous silvery-white post-transition metal.    Indium, so named for the colour indigo, which is the brightest line in its atomic emission spectrum, is one of the rarest elements on earth. It was discovered in a sample of zinc, and industrial quantities of indium are purified from some zinc, tin and lead ores, many of which are found in Canada and China. Interestingly, indium was found in pumice ejected by the Indonesian volcano, Krakatoa, when it erupted explosively in 1883, shortly after indium&apos;s initial discovery. Indium plays no known biological role in any living thing, but it is a toxin that may be absorbed through the skin. It causes damage to the kidneys, liver and heart. Indium alloyed with gallium or with tin (indium tin oxide; commonly known as ITO) are important to industry because they combine three unusual characters: they &quot;wet&quot;, or bind to, glass; they are transparent; and they conduct electricity -- features that make these alloys a key component of solar panels, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and touchscreens that are incorporated into flatscreen televisions, computers and other electronic gadgetry.  In this short video, our favourite chemistry professor tells us a little more about indium:             Visit PeriodicVideos&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  One last peculiar feature of indium is its vocal nature. When bent, it emits what is described as a &quot;cry&quot; (tin also does this). Some people describe it as a high-pitched scream. However, I think this sound is more like a faint crackle, but you be the judge:             Visit bhadeshia123&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  Source: USGS report: Indium.

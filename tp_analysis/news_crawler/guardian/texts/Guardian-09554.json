    "text": "Public opposition to the use of animals in medical research is growing and trust in both scientists and the rules governing the controversial practice is falling, new government-funded research shows. More than one in three people (37%) now class themselves as &quot;objectors&quot; to the practice. Their number has been rising steadily since the 29% recorded in 2006 and 35% seen in 2010, though is still lower than the 39% found in 2002, according to the latest research into public attitudes on the issue by Ipsos MORI. Objectors either do not support the use of animals in experimentation because of concern for animal welfare (32%) or believe the government should ban experiments on animals for any form of research (21%), or both. They are more heavily female (41%) than male (33%) and more likely to be those aged 15 to 24 (55%) and also those in the lowest socio-economic class ranked as DE (51% compared to 23% of ABs). That hardening of attitudes is part of what Ipsos MORI called a &quot;significant&quot; shift away from people endorsing the need for use of animals in such projects. While 85% of the 1,026 Britons aged 15 and older questioned &quot;conditionally&quot; support the practice, that is down from the 90% found in 2010, according to the poll, which the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills paid for. Among those, the proportion backing the use of animals provided it is for medical research has fallen from 76% in 2010 to 66%, with 16% disagreeing. Approval is also down among those who &quot;unconditionally&quot; accept such experiments. Those agreeing that animal experimentation does not bother them or they support it for all types of research when there is no alternative, or both, have fallen from 60% to 55%. The poll&apos;s findings also show that: &quot;In 2012, the public are less trusting of scientists not to cause unnecessary suffering in the animals involved (47% now, 54% in 2010), but are also less alert to the possibility of experiments being needlessly duplicated (51% now, 61% in 2010).&quot; While 54% trust the government&apos;s inspectorate and 53% think Britain&apos;s rules governing animal experimentation, 43% do not trust the regulatory system  down from 56% in 2010. But overall 40% said they wanted to know more about animal experimentation before forming a view. The findings have prompted scientists, medical research charities, drug firms and universities to pledge to be more open about the use of animals in experiments in a bid to gain more widespread public support. Understanding Animal Research, which supports &quot;humane&quot; use of animals in biomedical research, points out that &quot;over the last 40 years every Nobel prize in physiology or medicine bar one has depended on work using animals.&quot; Forty-one organisations, including Cancer Research UK, the Academy of Medical Sciences, Universities UK and the Medical Research Council, have agreed a &quot;declaration on openness on animal research&quot;. That will see them &quot;taking part in an ongoing conversation about why and how animals are used in research and the benefits of this&quot;, for example in the search for treatments for cancer, dementia and heart disease. An ensuing concordat will detail as yet undefined moves to make use of animals more transparent, though a major public awareness campaign looks likely. Professor Sir John Tooke, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said they were &quot;concerned&quot; at the poll&apos;s results. Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said that, while two-thirds of people still accepted the use of animals for medical research, the 10% should be &quot;a wake-up call&quot;. Britain&apos;s life sciences community need to be &quot;more forthright about the fact that without animal research, the bio-pharmaceutical sector cannot continue to innovate new treatments&quot;, he added. Sir Mark Walport, head of the Wellcome Trust, Britain&apos;s biggest charity, denied &quot;complacency&quot; among scientists had led to falling public support. He blamed a continuing &quot;environment of intimidation&quot; which, at its most extreme, constituted &quot;terrorism&quot;, he said. Whitehead said crashing of websites and other illegal tactics had deterred some people involved in conducting or helping animal experimentation. The poll also found that 9% believe it is acceptable for protestors to occupy research facilities or disrupt firms providing services to such research centres, 8% see roadblocks as acceptable and 2% and 1% respectively see destroying property and physical violence in the same light. David Willetts, the science minister, confirmed that talks are going on with airlines and ferry companies about resuming the import of some live animals which are specially-bred overseas for use in trials into conditions such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease. &quot;The government is committed to working to reduce the use of animals in scientific research, but we do recognise that there remains a strong scientific case for the careful regulated use of animals in scientific research and that this does play a role in ensuring new medicines are safe and effective&quot;, he added.",

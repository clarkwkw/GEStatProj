    "text": "One year after drought and famine killed tens of thousands of people in east Africa, relief agencies are warning that poor rains, a lack of funds and conflict could again cause food shortages and hardship among people ill-equipped to deal with another season of hunger. In Somalia, where famine was declared last July, thousands of people are still on the move, fleeing violence, searching for assistance, or avoiding Islamist militants who may want to recruit young men. For some people, constant movement has become a strategy for survival. Poor and late seasonal rains could lead to small harvests in some parts of the Horn of Africa, while aid agencies say funding shortfalls are limiting their ability to help those already in need, and those who may require help in the coming months. During last year&apos;s drought, hundreds of thousands of Somalis fled into neighbouring countries. Around 160,000 came to the world&apos;s largest refugee camp in Kenya&apos;s Dadaab, pushing the population to around 465,000. Rising numbers and a spate of bombings and kidnappings, which forced many relief agencies to reduce their activities, mean basic services at the camp have been strained, and the situation could get worse. On Thursday, eight aid agencies working in Dadaab, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Care, warned that if a funding shortfall of $25m is not covered, vital services could run out in two to three months, affecting at least 200,000 people. The agencies called on the international community to examine new long-term solutions for the camp, warning that funding shortages could worsen insecurity in an area that has seen a significant increase in violence since Kenyan troops crossed the nearby border into Somalia last October to pursue al-Shabaab militants. &quot;If children are not going to school and if people do not have proper shelter and other services, this has the potential to fuel further militarisation, violence and instability,&quot; said Stephen Vaughan, head of Care Kenya. Funds from international donors and individuals allowed aid agencies to send thousands of tonnes of food aid to Somalia last year, but the humanitarian community was also criticised for failing to heed early warning signs that a crisis was in the making. There are fears now that more refugees may arrive in Dadaab and other camps around the region if harvests are poor in Somalia, or if conflict intensifies. The USAid-funded famine early warning systems network (Fewsnet) said in mid-June that crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity were expected to persist (pdf) through at least September in parts of the Horn of Africa after mixed and below-average rains between March and May. It said that in parts of Ethiopia&apos;s SNNPR region, the north-eastern highlands and southern Somalia, emergency food aid needs would peak in July and August. It also warned that a very poor harvest after the long rainy season  from mid-June to mid-September  was expected in south-eastern Kenya and the coastal lowlands. &quot;Poor and very poor households are reportedly turning to distress coping strategies such as distant labour migration and withdrawal of children from school to engage in labour,&quot; according to Fewsnet. An Oxfam spokesman in Nairobi said rains in arid parts of northern Kenya had been relatively good this year, with reasonable amounts of pasture and water. There are pockets where rainfall was below average, but overall the situation is more positive. However, people in these areas, including in Turkana and Wajir, are still in need, with malnutrition rates at emergency levels, partly because of a chronic lack of basic services. In Somalia, Fewsnet said poor harvests were expected in parts of Middle and Lower Juba, Gedo, Bakool, Bay and Hiran due to poor rainfall and pest infestations, with food prices also expected to rise until the next harvest, due in August. Somalia generates the third highest number of refugees in the world (pdf), after Afghanistan and Iraq. There are nearly a million Somali refugees living in the region. But a durable solution to the Somalia conflict still seems a long way off. The current transitional government is due to cede power soon to a new parliament, which will elect a president on 20 August. However, the UN-backed process has been fraught with delays and accusations of foul play by political leaders. Al-Shabaab do appear to be on the back foot as the African Union&apos;s AMISOM forces and Somali troops push deeper into their territory, but the militants still hold the southern port city of Kismayo, and harry their enemies with gun-and-bomb attacks across the country. Given that a short-term solution to the conflict is unlikely, some aid groups say new ideas are needed for camps like Dadaab. &quot;Refugee camps are only temporary solutions and the situation is increasingly untenable,&quot; said Nigel Tricks, head of Oxfam in Kenya. &quot;Funds are needed now to save lives, but we can&apos;t keep pumping money in year after year while the camp keeps getting bigger. A change in approach is urgently needed. However, right now, the world has an obligation not to turn its back on Dadaab,&quot; he said.",

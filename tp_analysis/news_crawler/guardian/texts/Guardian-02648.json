    "text": "All of Tanzania&apos;s primary schools are to receive textbooks to be paid for by BAE Systems under a memorandum of understanding signed by the Tanzanian government, BAE and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) on Thursday. In all, BAE will pay 29.5m plus accrued interest for educational projects in Tanzania, following a settlement between the defence contractor and the SFO for concealing payments in connection with the sale of an air traffic control system to the east African country in 2002. Textbooks will be purchased for all 16,000 primary schools in the country, benefiting 8.3 million children. &quot;Having a textbook alone will not improve the quality of education, so funds will also be used to provide all 175,000 primary school teachers with teachers&apos; guides, syllabi and syllabi guides to help improve their teaching skills,&quot; the SFO said in a statement. &quot;Up to 5m will be spent on the purchase of desks to benefit primary school children living in nine districts where the need for investment in education is considered greatest.&quot; BAE was fined 500,000 in 2010 for concealing payments of $12.4m to Sailesh Vithlani, a marketing adviser in Tanzania, in connection with the radar deal. The company agreed with the SFO to make an ex-gratia payment equivalent to the size of the contract to the Tanzanian people. MPs on the international development committee last year strongly criticised BAE for dragging its feet over the payment. BAE wanted the payment to be described as a &quot;charitable contribution&quot; to Tanzania in negotiations over the drafting of the memorandum of understanding. The military radar deal went through just weeks after Clare Short, the development secretary at the time, had negotiated a large increase in aid to Tanzania to fund universal free education. Tanzania had no air force at that point and was receiving debt relief. GDP per head was just 465. Worried that the extra aid she had negotiated would be immediately swallowed up to pay BAE, Short attempted to block the deal, but it went ahead after Tony Blair, the prime minister at the time, intervened. The SFO began an investigation into BAE Systems in 2004, prompted by allegations over the al-Yamamah defence contract with Saudi Arabia. The SFO investigation broadened into contracts between BAE and a number of other countries (including Czech Republic, Romania and South Africa). The SFO investigation in connection with Saudi Arabia was discontinued in December 2006 on grounds of national security. In February, BAE finished settlement negotiations with the US department of justice in relation to contracts with Saudi Arabia and central and eastern Europe, and with the SFO in relation to the Tanzania contract. Following Thursday&apos;s memorandum of understanding, international development secretary Andrew Mitchell said: &quot;The British government has been helping identify the best way for BAE&apos;s settlement money to be spent in the interests of Tanzania&apos;s poorest people  I am pleased that all parties have now signed the memorandum of understanding and urge BAE to make their payment as soon as possible.&quot; The Department for International Development said the entire process will be rigorously and independently monitored and audited on behalf of the four signatories to ensure the money is used solely for the benefit of the Tanzanian people. BAE said the money had left its account. &quot;We are glad to finally be able to make the payment to the government of Tanzania and bring this matter to a close,&quot; the company said. &quot;We are grateful to DfID for their work in agreeing the memorandum of understanding with the government of Tanzania.&quot;",

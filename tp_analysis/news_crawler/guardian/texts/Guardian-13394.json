    "text": "Google&apos;s hardware arm, Motorola Mobility, is to slash 1,200 jobs in the latest round of redundancies at the struggling manufacturing business. The layoffs represent 10% of Motorola&apos;s workforce, and come on top of the 4,000 jobs lost in August as Google seeks to return the business it bought in mid-2011 to profitability. &quot;These cuts are a continuation of the reductions we announced last summer,&quot; a spokeswoman for the company said. &quot;It&apos;s obviously very hard for the employees concerned, and we are committed to helping them through this difficult transition.&quot; The redundancies will affect workers in the United States, China and India. At the end of 2012 Motorola had 11,113 employees. In the third quarter of last year it suffered an operating loss of more than $500m, followed by a loss of more than $350m in the fourth quarter. Motorola once dominated the phone business, with models such as the Razr gaining a worldwide following, but it was left behind by the technological revolution that transformed mobiles from devices for making calls to pocket-sized personal computers. An email sent to staff this week and seen by the Wall Street Journal said &quot;while we&apos;re very optimistic about the new products in our pipeline, we still face challenges  our costs are too high, we&apos;re operating in markets where we&apos;re not competitive and we&apos;re losing money.&quot; Google has transferred senior executives, including former Europe and Americas executive Dennis Woodside, to run the business, acquired for $12.5bn (9.6bn). Those remaining are reported to be working on a device called the &quot;X Phone&quot; that could become the unit&apos;s flagship device.",

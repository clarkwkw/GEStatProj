    "text": "One of the first contracts for the clean-up of the Fukushima nuclear power plant has been awarded to EnergySolutions, a US-UK firm that is decommissioning 22 nuclear power stations in the UK. EnergySolutions will be charged with decontaminating the seawater that was used to cool the reactor as it went into meltdown, in the world&apos;s worst nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl accident in 1986. About 125,000 cubic metres of seawater  enough to fill 60 Olympic swimming pools  was used in an attempt to cool the reactor during the accident, and is now in storage. The clean-up contract is thought to be worth between 20m and 30m. The contaminated water contains as many as 60 different types of radioactive nuclides, which must be removed before the water can be returned to the sea. When processed, the level of nuclides in the water will be undetectable. EnergySolutions is in charge of decommissioning the UK&apos;s Magnox reactors, an early generation form of nuclear power that is now obsolete. The Fukushima nuclear incident, which occurred just over a year ago, followed the flooding of the plant after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan and killed nearly 20,000 people, did not result in any direct fatalities. However, the meltdown prompted several governments  including Japan, Germany, Switzerland and Italy  to reconsider their commitment to nuclear power.",

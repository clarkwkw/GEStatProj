    "text": "Veteran British developer Jeff Minter is known for his slightly surreal, psychedelic games, and the quick and easy distribution offered by Apple has seen him develop a succession of quality titles, of which the latest Five A Day (App Store, 1.49, Llamasoft) is no exception. At heart, it&apos;s a simple shoot &apos;em up  a bullet storm game, where the player&apos;s spaceship fires a stream of projectiles in the direction you&apos;re facing. However, this is what Minter terms a &quot;fruit &apos;em up&quot;. Enemy ships trail strings of fruit, which must be collected by blowing foes out of the sky. These fruits then act as a destructive tail to use against the bosses  in the style of a Tron lightcycle. Worlds come five levels at a time  and you must end each one alive and with some form of organic treat. Hence: Five A Day. The neon visuals and amusing fruity facts at the end of each level make for an enjoyably fresh experience. Total War Battles: Shogun (App Store, Creative Assembly, 4.99), meanwhile, offers more long-term entertainment, a stripped-down version of the PC real-time strategy behemoth. The complex stats beloved of fans have been removed to make for easier mobile gaming, but the tactical battles remain, with buildings and units needing to be carefully positioned to come out on top. Different combat types are introduced gradually and the tutorial does a fine job of initiating those unfamiliar with the series. While the skirmishes are much shorter, the campaign provides plenty of missions nicely segmented for gaming on the move.",

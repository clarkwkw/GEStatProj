    "text": "As the recently appointed pro vice-chancellor for engagement at the University of Central Lancashire, my role is pretty varied. I have regular meetings with people ranging from academics, journalists, politicians and chief executives. Just recently I met with the commissioner of the NHS to discuss UCLan&apos;s MBA in health before going on to meet the director of a major manufacturer about the need to address the skills gap for engineers and scientists, which is acute, particularly in Lancashire  the UK&apos;s main manufacturing region. Liaising with industry professionals is paramount for higher educational professionals to ensure our teaching meets the demands of industry and that we offer talent with real world skills. At UCLan, we have worked with the police service and aviation industry to develop a degree in airport security management  the first in the UK. At a time when border controls are under increased scrutiny, this course will ensure our graduates are prepared for the evolving security landscape. Research collaboration is an important pillar in our engagement strategy, but so too, is developing and nurturing the next generation of entrepreneurs. Our Northern Lights business support initiative has seen a 24% increase in the number of graduate startups developed in the last 12 months. Also, we equip our students with enterprise and business know-how to be effective in the real world of work. But I want to build on this work with an Institute of Innovation and Enterprise, supported by networks of entrepreneurs to really bring the best out of our students. I hope to address the needs of entrepreneurs in general, and females, in particular, who tend to find it harder to access the finance and resources they need to get off the ground. And I am also keen for UCLan to take advantage of the latest developments in the digital communication and creative industries, which are two subjects I am personally very interested in. Business engagement isn&apos;t always about big headline partnerships  although they are not to be scorned. Last month, a report from IPPR North, Beyond Bricks and Mortar: universities&apos; role in building regional economies, discussed how universities can help drive local economies. The report offered some interesting insights into how universities can support local business and we will be looking to build on some of its recommendations. We are fortunate in that we are so closely intertwined with the local community. Other universities perhaps aren&apos;t so embedded in their local environment, but my advice to them is to reach out to local business to contribute to innovation and enrich the economy, as well as strengthen the opportunities to retain graduates in the region. The key to successful partnerships is ensuring it is mutually beneficial for both parties. For example, our relationship with female entrepreneur, Kirsty Henshaw, means she is able to run her Worthenshaws business from UCLan&apos;s Preston incubator. The business support from UCLan and the web skills from our graduates are invaluable to her business and in return she offers mentoring sessions and inspiration to our budding entrepreneurs. As I hope you can see, mine is a challenging role. My advice for anyone embarking on a similar position in higher education is to be receptive to new ideas within the university to make sure you can capture the new ideas that could help open doors to new partnerships. Engagement is not a static affair, managing multiple stakeholders with competing priorities is a challenge. Universities, as well as businesses, are complex international organisations. Being an effective communicator is vital  as is being able to respond quickly to new opportunities when they present themselves, which they will. These tips are essential to ensure innovation, entrepreneurialism and engagement become embedded within the fabric of your institution. If universities and businesses aren&apos;t talking, then a wealth of opportunities are being missed. It is essential to enjoy the challenge. If we get it right, engagement is vital for universities, positively affects the businesses we partner with, and ultimately, enriches students&apos; experience.

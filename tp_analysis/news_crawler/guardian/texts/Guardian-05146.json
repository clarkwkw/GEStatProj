    "text": "A new study published in Nature has found that the world&apos;s largest mountain chain, running from the Himalayas to Tian Shan on the border of Kyrgystan and China, has not experienced any net loss of ice over the past decade.  This came as a surprise to glaciologists who had thought that melting in the Himalayas and nearby peaks was making an appreciable contribution to sea level rise. Why the reassessment? Here&apos;s how our story on the study puts it:  The reason for the radical reappraisal of ice melting in Asia is the different ways in which the current and previous studies were conducted. Until now, estimates of meltwater loss for all the world&apos;s 200,000 glaciers were based on extrapolations of data from a few hundred monitored on the ground. Those glaciers at lower altitudes are much easier for scientists to get to and so were more frequently included, but they were also more prone to melting.  Leo Hickman&apos;s Eco Audit column is asking what this reappraisal means for scientists&apos; understanding of the effect of climate change on other glaciers around the world. Also, between 2.10pm and 3pm, glaciologist was Prof Jonathan Bamber, the director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre, will be live on the site answering your questions about the implications of the study.

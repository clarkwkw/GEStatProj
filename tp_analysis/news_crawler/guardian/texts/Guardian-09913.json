    "headline": "A smartphone for Christmas: Samsung or Apple?", 
    "text": "My son recently bought a Google Nexus 7 tablet and my wife was highly impressed. I thought that was Christmas sorted, but she says a smartphone would suit her better as the bottom-of-the-range Android she uses is struggling to get by. I thought I could stretch to buying her the hardware and she could negotiate a SIM-only contract when the time came.I&apos;m not entirely clued up on phones but I&apos;ve narrowed it down to a fight between an Apple iPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy S III as I know she&apos;s been impressed with both of these.She wants a phone, camera, Facebook, email and shopping. Are these as good as they get?Paul If your wife had a particular interest in smartphones then she would probably have stated a preference. If it&apos;s your job to choose, then I&apos;d go for the cheapest, closest upgrade.  I&apos;m basing this advice on personal experience. My wife resists change: she&apos;s sticking with Windows Vista and an old Nokia, despite my upgrade attempts, because they still do everything she wants.  If it came to a straight fight between the Apple iPhone 4S and the Samsung Galaxy S III, then the Galaxy S III would win on having better technology while the iPhone 4S would win for having a better ecosystem, in terms of apps and accessories. In hardware terms, the Galaxy S III has a much bigger and better screen than the iPhone 4S (4.8in v 3.5in), and the screen has a higher resolution (720 x 1280 pixels v 640 x 960 pixels). The S III also has a faster processor (quad-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A9 v dual-core 1GHz Cortex-A9), twice as much RAM (1GB vs 512MB), and better battery life. Despite all this, the S III is thinner (8.6mm vs 9.3mm) and lighter (133g vs 140g) than the iPhone 4S, and cheaper (385 at Amazon.co.uk vs 449 from Apple). The Galaxy S III also has many features that all iPhones lack. These include a standard microUSB port that supports USB On-The-Go and charging, NFC for contactless payments, a free FM radio, Adobe Flash support, and a choice of colours: red, blue, brown and grey, as well as black and white. Of course, it&apos;s unfair to compare this year&apos;s Galaxy S III with last year&apos;s iPhone 4S, and Apple has recently launched the iPhone 5. This has a bigger 4in screen with a higher resolution of 1136 x 640 pixels, and a much faster processor, so it comes closer to the S III. However, the iPhone 5 also has a new Lightning connector that is different from previous models, takes a new kind of nano-SIM, and comes at a very hefty price: 529 from the Apple Store. The Galaxy S III&apos;s numerous features appeal to technology geeks, but your wife isn&apos;t one. It would be perfectly reasonable for her to prefer an iPhone for other reasons, such as ease of use or the choice of apps. (Although Android now has roughly as many apps as the iPhone, the iPhone apps are often better.) However, she is already an Android user and doesn&apos;t appear to need any particular iPhone-specific apps, so I&apos;d suggest sticking with Android.  But I also suspect that she doesn&apos;t really need a Galaxy S III, and that either last year&apos;s Galaxy S II or the Galaxy Nexus would be acceptable alternatives.  The Galaxy S II has a smaller 4.3in screen, but it&apos;s still big by smartphone standards. Obviously it has a slower processor (dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A9) and lacks advanced S III features such as LTE (4G) and NFC support, but it still has the microUSB port, microSD card slot, and FM radio. The major drawbacks to the Galaxy S II are the limited screen resolution of 480 x 800 pixels, and probably an old version of the operating system, Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread). You should be able to update an S II to version 4.1 (Jelly Bean), but you can&apos;t do anything about the screen resolution. The advantage of buying the S II over the S III is that it saves about 105. At the time of writing, an S II costs 280.60 at Amazon.co.uk. (I&apos;m quoting Amazon for consistency but you can shop around for deals.) Perhaps an even better alternative would be the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which has a 4.65in screen that shows 720 x 1280 pixels. In brief, the Nexus has the same processor as the S II, and the same screen resolution as the S III, though with a slightly worse camera (5MP vs 8MP). Being a Google Nexus, it ships with a clean version of Android 4, without Samsung&apos;s TouchWiz front end. And while it&apos;s an upgrade on the S II, it currently costs slightly less at Amazon.co.uk: 275. Find out the name and model number of your wife&apos;s Android phone, then go to the GSM Arena website and click the Compare button. Search for and select your wife&apos;s phone and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and check the line-by-line comparison. Do not buy the Nexus unless it offers a faster processor, a bigger screen and more on-screen pixels than her current smartphone. However, if your wife&apos;s phone is bottom-of-the-range, as you say, then it should offer a worthwhile upgrade. Whether the Galaxy S III is worth the extra 110 is a matter of opinion. You could take the view that it&apos;s well worth an extra 1 per week over its two-year lifespan, or that 275 is more than enough to pay for a smartphone. Ask your wife, and see what she thinks.",

    "text": "Don&apos;t think of Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion as a mere handheld companion to Epic Mickey: The Power of Two, which hits the Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3 this November. Instead, think of it as a long overdue sequel to Castle of Illusion, the lavishly crafted Sega game from 1990. In truth, of course, it&apos;s both of these things, retaining the paint and paint-thinner mechanics of Warren Spector&apos;s series, and the delicate 2D art and side-scrolling action that made the famous mouse&apos;s 16bit incarnations such wonderfully sumptuous charmers. Power of Illusion&apos;s shaping up to be far from your average 3DS tie-in, in other words  nostalgic and creative by turns. The plot, such as it is, sees Mickey exploring the shifting chambers of the Castle of Illusion on yet another quest to save Minnie; it&apos;s just an excuse, and a fairly bare-bones one, to bottom-bounce your way through decades of classic Disney fare. Early levels channel Peter Pan, for example, sending you racing over the midnight skyline of a sleeping London, leaping from chimney pots to spars of cloud, and eventually heading on to the jungles of Neverland. A few minutes later, Aladdin gets his turn, with stages set in the streets of Agrabah, where pendulum blades swing from awnings and good old quicksand is on hand to keep you moving along at a decent clip. It&apos;s all gloriously pretty, using the stereoscopic 3D in smart, understated ways, but that&apos;s only half the game - the top half, as it turns out, since a jab of the 3DS&apos; touch screen allows you to pause the action and meddle with the environment.      This is where the paint and paint-thinner come in, as you erase junk that&apos;s blocking Mickey&apos;s path, and draw in ledges that will help him over long jumps. It&apos;s tightly controlled, with the interactive pieces shown in ghost form on the bottom screen, but there&apos;s a pleasant arcade flourish to things, too, as you&apos;re graded on how well you match the outline to add or remove each item.  By the second or third level, you&apos;ll be switching between screens every ten seconds, adding cannons that will propel Mickey right across the map, and removing hazards as well as simple obstacles. On paper, it might threaten to break the flow of the game, but in reality in merely builds the rhythm: this is a puzzler as much as a platformer, and it encourages you to use both logic and timing. If any of this screen-swapping stuff sound vaguely familiar, it&apos;s because the team at Dreamrift, who are responsible for making Power of Illusion, include veterans of EA&apos;s wonderfully deranged Henry Hatsworth DS game, which let players blend together the mechanics of a platformer and a match-three puzzler to synapse-frying effect. Hatsworth was known for its awkward difficulty spikes, incidentally, but if anything Mickey seems surprisingly tooled-up for his adventure, facing off against a selection of enemies with whirlwind and jumping melee attacks, as well as paint and paint-thinner ranged weapons. He&apos;s also got a handful of sketches he can employ on each level, which act a little like special moves. One might conjure a chest filled with power-ups, while another might grant him temporary invincibility. Some of them even pile on the cameos, plucking Scrooge McDuck right out of the old Capcom Duck Tales games and sending him pogoing across the landscape on his cane. It&apos;s a lovely aside, and it feels entirely appropriate, too. Epic Mickey&apos;s a game caught in ceaseless orbit around the ancient lore of Disney&apos;s films and theme parks. Surely it&apos;s only fitting that the 3DS instalment draws on the company&apos;s rich history in games, too?  Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion is released in the UK on 3DS on 23 November",

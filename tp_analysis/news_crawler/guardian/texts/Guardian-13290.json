    "text": "Your correspondence about school governance (Letters, 5 March) was headlined &quot;School governors&apos; arrangements ripe for review&quot;. The Commons education select committee is already carrying out such an inquiry and the evidence gathered from a large range of organisations is surprisingly consistent. There is already much flexibility that schools can use to set their governance arrangements and no one disputes the need to have skilled people undertaking this critically important role. However, most governors want induction training for new recruits to be mandatory  it is a nonsense that this is a challenging role and yet doesn&apos;t require a proper introduction. This is a real test for ministers who espouse the advantages of local decision-making and freedoms; yet they seem to be surprised  and sometimes downright peeved  when governing bodies are not universally eager to give up their freedoms to a sponsor organisation, but want instead to strengthen their own partnerships with other local schools. The government decided to give governing bodies more discretion and it must now trust us to take decisions that are in the best interests of the young people in our schools. That&apos;s why we volunteer; governors are driven by moral purpose and do not require payment to do the right thing.Emma KnightsChief executive, National Governors&apos; Association  Vic Goddard of Passmores academy rightly says that creating for-profit schools will be &quot;taking money out of the sector&quot; (Education, 5 March), but he does not go far enough. Educational, medical, arts and sports charities all subsidise projects in schools, including visits of professionals, campaigns, events and visits outside school grounds. Why should they continue to spend their own charitable funds on profit-making enterprises? It has already been shown that many charities will not spend their resources in private prisons, but will charge the full recovery price of any activity. Most charitable trusts will not grant funds to profit-making bodies, so raising money for development or infrastructure will become more difficult. Any loan to a school which is also a business would be made by a body which expects its own cut in the form of interest or other profit. If a school is for-profit, how can its parent-teacher association keep its charitable status? And will parent and community support  in terms of volunteering and financial donations  be sustained if they know that the proceeds from the school fete might end up in a numbered bank account in Switzerland? Even the richest public schools in the land have charitable status  I cannot imagine any of them giving it up in favour of a for-profit model. Overall, it is a very, very bad idea.Catherine RoseDirector, Catherine Rose&apos;s Office Ltd  George Monbiot relates how &quot;With threats and bribes our schools are forced to be &apos;free&apos;&quot;, while you report in the same issue &quot;Schools budgets could face cuts as the coalition row over spending escalates&quot; (5 March). So it&apos;s predictable that private investors could step in as the saviours of state schooling when  not if  the schools budget is cut. Our new book, The Great Reversal, reveals Michael Gove proposing for the Conservatives&apos; 2015 manifesto that private firms be allowed to run state schools for a profit. He is supported in this by the Bright Blue group, in which higher education minister David Willetts is a leading luminary, since universities and colleges could go the same way when their funding runs out. Some, eg Central Lancashire, are already preparing to do so.Professor Patrick Ainley Dr Martin AllenUniversity of Greenwich",

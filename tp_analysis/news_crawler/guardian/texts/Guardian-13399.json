    "text": "Leading heritage organisations have won a high court battle against plans for a windfarm they warn will result in substantial harm to a heritage area &quot;of national significance&quot;. English Heritage and the National Trust say the case has national implications. They supported East Northamptonshire district council&apos;s successful legal bid to block proposals submitted by West Coast Energy for four 300 feet (91 metre) turbines on farmland at Barnwell Manor in Sudborough. The manor is owned by the Duke of Gloucester, the Queen&apos;s cousin, who is not directly involved in the challenge. Mrs Justice Lang ruled at London&apos;s high court today that the decision to give the go-ahead was legally flawed and must be quashed. Maf Smith, the deputy chief executive of industry trade body RenewableUK, said: &quot;It would be wrong to suggest that any kind of precedent has been set on this occasion, as each windfarm application is considered on a case-by-case basis. &quot;The fact that this application went to the high court shows that, at times, decisions are finely balanced and difficult to reach. &quot;The very same high court judge, Mrs Justice Lang, upheld applications for two windfarms in Norfolk in January  even though campaigners against renewable energy had tried to cite heritage issues in that particular case. So any attempt to claim that one single judgment sets an unchangeable pattern is incorrect. Any case can go either way, depending on the exact circumstances.&quot; The director-general of the National Trust, Helen Ghosh, said: &quot;Lyveden is a remarkable building with a very particular spirit. We are delighted that our visitors&apos; experience of its beautiful setting is now one step closer to being safeguarded. &quot;Clearly every legal case is different, but this sets an important marker in the defence of the historic environment from inappropriate development.&quot;",

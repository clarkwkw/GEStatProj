    "text": "     Nipped fingers and handfuls of guano will be the order of the day for wildlife rangers on the Farne Islands as they embark on an epic census on Friday to discover whether puffin numbers have plummeted after a year of extreme weather. The 10 National Trust rangers living on the islands must dangle their bare fingers down 60,000 puffin burrows in the next two months to determine whether breeding pairs have fallen after the worst puffin &quot;wreck&quot; for 66 years.

Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/PA    The wreck in March, which saw 3,500 birds wash up dead along the north-east coast of Britain, was caused by icy easterly winds. It followed a summer when the puffins on the archipelago off Northumberland were flooded out of their underground homes, with more than 40% failing to breed. &quot;We&apos;re very concerned,&quot; said David Steel, head ranger on the Farne Islands. &quot;We were very optimistic until last summer [2012] when we had a very wet summer and breeding success was poor. Then in March [2013] we&apos;ve had this other extreme weather that actually killed quite a lot of puffins.&quot;     In March, 3,500 dead puffins washed up along the north-east coast of Britain.

But that figure was a 30% fall from the high of 2003, raising fears that the extreme weather and warmer seas brought about by climate change may be affecting the puffins. The birds spend winter floating on the North Sea, and feed by diving for sand eels. But in stormy weather the water becomes too turbid to detect their prey. Warmer sea temperatures may also be driving the sand eels further north.     Farne Islands.

The &quot;wreck&quot; killed the old, sick and young but wardens have reported good numbers returning for the breeding season. Puffins have flourished on the Farnes thanks to the National Trust&apos;s careful management of the 40,000 visitors who take boat trips to the islands each year  and the absence of ground predators. There are no foxes or rats, although wardens are monitoring this carefully after a ship ran aground on the islands in March.     Counting puffins is undertaken by carefully reaching into each burrow with a bare hand.

The amount of bites and scars they are going to have will be interesting.&quot;  National Trust puffin webcam   View 2013 Puffin seabird wreck in a larger map ",

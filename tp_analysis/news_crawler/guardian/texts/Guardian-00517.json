    "text": "Over the past two weeks, we&apos;ve heard various experts&apos; thoughts on what will shape development in 2012. We asked our readers what they think will define the year. Here&apos;s what they had to say. IanAldridge, in the UK We saw the Arab spring all over the news last year, but what does this really mean on a global scale? I think 2012 could see ushered in massive political change, not just in revolutionising Arab states but across the globe. The realisation that we are not &quot;slaves to the machine&quot; and that in fact governments should be working for the people will hopefully lead to greater social welfare for the masses, and minimise mismanagement by governments. It&apos;s not just in Middle Eastern nations either. Political change is itching for its beginnings across parts of Africa. Take Zimbabwe, for instance, where Tsvangirai&apos;s MDC is finally starting to make some real progress towards change and Mugabe&apos;s regime, although still very much present, is seemingly declining. In addition, we&apos;ve seen disenfranchised social groups in western countries fight back, from the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) protests  that are now a global phenomenon - to the London riots, and sooner or later governments are going to recognise the need for change. The potential for global political change in 2012 presents plenty of issues for &quot;developing nations&quot; as well as &quot;developed nations&quot;  from tackling the bankers to renovating education and healthcare systems. But the promise of change and striving for global political and economic reformation, as well as closer union, following the recessions and failings of recent history can surely be seen as beneficial on the world stage  albeit a small step forward on an exceedingly long road. TracyS, in the UK What will most affect the lives of poor people in 2012? Well, that depends where you live. And who lives around you. And what else you&apos;ve got going on in your life. (One which you do have, even though the World Bank has classified you as poor, thus rendering anyone incapable of thinking of you in any other way.) It&apos;s almost unbelievable that we still ask questions like this. Perhaps the biggest challenge for poor people in 2012 (and beyond, unfortunately) will be the persistent tendency of those working in a now massive development industry to need big solutions, defining issues, key challenges. What for? The public? The media? The people signing off on the budgets? Less so for the people who are affected, because their lives  like everyone&apos;s lives  are profoundly more complicated than one big issue and one big solution. We remain almost pathologically bound to this need to have clear universal challenges and clear universal solutions. After all, they make it possible to devise policy, and we all know the world would end without policy. First, it was the state, then it was the market. We had mass excitement about the potential of access to credit. The era of good governance. This is not to say that these ideas have had no positive impacts  most things have some positive impact in some places. Unfortunately, too often it seems as if the biggest challenge for poor people  everywhere  is the way people think about them. A big mass of people under the poverty line who are all affected by the same thing, and who all need the same thing. Oddly enough, that is never an idea which challenges the fundamental structures of the global political economy. aliceodile, in the UK 2012 will be defined by the battle against the resource curse, which has kept so many in poverty. Natural resource wealth  if properly managed  is one of the most important sources of income for developing countries. In 2008, oil and mining exports in Africa were worth nine times more than aid. With a mining commodity boom in full swing and growing emphasis placed on countries mobilising their own tax base, 2012 is the year for countries to ensure the best for their massive, but finite natural resources. Already, the upcoming elections in Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been dominated by the question of which candidate will best be able to manage their natural resources. In a post-Gaddafi Libya, in a post-independence South Sudan, the question on everybody&apos;s lips is how to ensure the fair and transparent management of natural resources. Last year&apos;s protests  which will continue to resonate throughout 2012  share the principles inherent in responsible natural resource management: an end to corruption, an end to disempowerment and an end to wealth entrenched in the hands of a few. Furthermore, there are two crucial pieces of legislation that could change the game in 2012. Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank law in the US, which has been passed but has yet to be put in force, requires extractive companies to be more transparent in their payments to governments. Newly-proposed EU directives on transparency and accounting will oblige companies to publish their payments to the governments where they operate. This information will give citizens the tools necessary to hold their governments to account. They will be able  often for the first time  to know exactly what their government has received and to ensure the money goes towards schools and hospitals rather than Malibu mansions and yachts. If 2011 was defined by the demand for greater accountability and empowerment, 2012 will be judged by how the world reacted to this call. WehYeoh, in Australia I have spent the year living in and visiting some of the poorest parts of rural China. I spent a memorable train ride talking to an elderly Chinese couple for several hours. While they could not speak a word of English, and my Chinese was passable, we managed to have a fairly in-depth conversation about their lives and opinions. At one stage, the husband, who was in his late 60s, mentioned that media control in China was too strong, so that people could not get on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube  and at this stage he revealed the only three English words in his entire vocabulary. I realised very quickly that access to information is critical for people living in developing nations. This man had shown me that you cannot write off people&apos;s desire to access information which is available elsewhere. I think that was a crucial turning point for my time in a country where censorship is so strong, because he demonstrated that you cannot pull the wool over people&apos;s eyes and expect them to remain silent. Similarly, on a global level, we have already seen that the spread of information is crucial to changing the lives of many people in the developing world, through the use of social media during the Arab spring. We&apos;re seeing mobile phone technology as an important method of getting information out in the health sphere. And, with a focus on education in development, what we&apos;re ultimately seeking is improved access to information. I think this is a trend that will continue into 2012. Free access to information brings equity with it, and that is something we are becoming more aware of on a global scale. MelissaJulian, in Brussels Changes on the African continent and in the EU have occurred at a dramatic pace in recent months. The underlying shifts arising from these changes and the evolving global and EU internal context are affecting many of the agreements and policy instruments linking the two continents. In Europe, the financial crisis raises uncertainty about the strength of the EU&apos;s foundations. Already, the effects of budget tightening are visible in EU development assistance. EU external policy is undergoing a reorientation. It will place more emphasis on promoting &quot;European values&quot;, such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The shift will become increasingly tangible in 2012. In Africa, a very different context is emerging. A sense of Afro-optimism is clearly discernible. The political transitions initiated in North Africa continue to inspire others abroad, and there is promising new momentum for regional integration. Democratic transitions are still fragile, but they bear real promise for improved governance, democracy and accountability. Africa&apos;s new partners have given it added leverage in international negotiations, also reinforcing the continent&apos;s self-confidence. Africa could well maintain its current rate of growth, thanks to improved macroeconomic management, investment inflows from emerging economies, and high prices in some raw materials markets. However, some of the fastest growing sectors are poorly linked to the rest of society. There are still many fragile states with poor levels of governance and widespread structural poverty. The slow progress towards the millennium development goals (MDGs) testifies to the difficulty of transforming economic growth into sustainable development. In 2012, the triangle of EU values, EU interests and a more self-reliant Africa opens possibilities for a number of scenarios. Whether the overall goal of advancing Europe&apos;s interests is reconcilable with the values that the EU is committed to pursue is a question repeatedly asked.

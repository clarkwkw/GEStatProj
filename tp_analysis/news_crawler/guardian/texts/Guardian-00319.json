    "text": "What do you wonder? That is the question the Science Museum has been asking for many months now, in posters, celebrity videos and in online images. Its been part of the museums strategy to ramp up excitement around its new Wonderlab gallery, a space full of interactive science exhibits designed to inspire children. But what many have been wondering is how Statoil, a major oil and gas company with plans to drill up to seven new wells in the Arctic, was allowed to become the gallerys title sponsor? Welcome to Wonderlab  the Science Museums latest ethical contradiction.   Related: Science Museum condemned for oil company sponsorship    The museum has attempted to defend its decision to work with Statoil. In response to a Freedom of Information request, it highlighted that Statoil is a legally operating company in the UK. The trouble is, we live in a world where legal, at least at the corporate level, does not always align with ethical. When Statoils business plan goes against both the overwhelming evidence on climate change and the targets agreed by world leaders in the Paris Climate deal, it seems bizarre that the companys activity is still deemed acceptable, especially by a museum of science. The research organisation, Oil Change International, recently crunched the numbers underlying those targets signed in Paris. Their conclusion? That if we are to meet a 2-degree, let alone a 1.5-degree temperature target, then No new fossil fuel extraction or transportation infrastructure should be built.  In Australia, Statoil is still considering plans to drill a series of ultra deepwater wells in the Great Australian Bight  an internationally recognised whale sanctuary  despite the decision this week of its strategic partner, BP, to pull out. The two companies had previously joined forces to host a grants scheme for community groups in the region. While those accepting grants undertake important work for their communities, the scheme itself represents a very cheap way for multinational oil and gas companies with big budgets to effectively buy favour among key stakeholders. Statoils sponsorship of Wonderlab comes from exactly the same corporate social responsibility playbook.          Protestors talk about Statoils sponsorship Of the new Science Museums new Wonderlab Gallery.    The companys sponsorship of Wonderlab may look like a generous gesture from outside but in reality, Statoil is buying a social legitimacy it does not deserve  and it is particularly sinister to purchase that legitimacy at the expense of young people who will inherit a world with an unstable climate. This is an attempt to associate the future of science and technology with fossil fuels at a time when society and policy makers have finally accepted that that it is not compatible with a sustainable future and a stable climate. As the impacts of climate change intensify and the world shifts away from fossil fuels, the Science Museum will look ever more out of touch with the words the Statoil gallery emblazoned upon its walls.

The Science Museum has previously had sponsorship deals with a range of unethical sponsors, from arms companies such as Airbus, to other fossil fuel companies such as BP and Shell. When Shells influence over the Science Museums climate science gallery was unearthed last year following Freedom of Information requests, the museums director, Ian Blatchford, sought to defend the museums engagement with fossil fuel funders. He wrote When it comes to the major challenges facing our society, from climate change to inspiring the next generation of engineers, we need to be engaging with all the key players including governments, industry and the public, not hiding away in a comfortable ivory tower. In reality, Blatchford is the one in the ivory tower  and not just because of the museums ties to Statoil. Wonderlab replaces the museums Launchpad gallery, a hub of interactive science exhibits designed to engage and inspire children. But unlike its predecessor, Wonderlab comes with an entry charge. Earlier this year, the science communication academic Dr Emily Dawson noted that charging for the museums most popular childrens gallery sends a clear message that science is for some families, but not for all. Thus Wonderlab represents a science communication mess as well as an ethical one. While the museums decision to offer free school visits will allow some children from disadvantaged backgrounds the opportunity to experience Wonderlab, Dawson argues that it is not enough to use school visits as a panacea for exclusive practice. Research recently undertaken by the Wellcome Trust showed that likelihood of visiting a science museum or centre is related to social class. Entry charges are not the only obstacle in the way of public access to science, but perhaps the most symbolic for a major cultural institution - particularly where the primary audience is children. Museums clearly do face difficulties in a period of spending cuts, but the Science Museum seems dogged by poor decision making in this area. Young people should not pick up the bill for government cuts, nor should they encounter science branded by a company that is not genuinely invested in their future. It is perfectly reasonable to question the supposed generosity of this multi-billion dollar oil company. Why did the Science Museum decide that, despite going to an unethical sponsor with an image problem for funding, it still needed to introduce an entry charge? A petition drawing out the connection between these two issues  access to science and access to oil  has already gained over 41 thousand signatures, and the numbers continue to grow. This is a stark signal of just how out of touch the museum has become - its time to think again. Dr Chris Garrard is a composer, researcher and activitist at Art Not Oil",

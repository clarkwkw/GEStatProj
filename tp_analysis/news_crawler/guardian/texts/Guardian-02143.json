Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 1 January 2012 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D7000    Question: This Chinese mystery bird species is strongly sexually dimorphic. Can you tell me what are the differences that exist between males and females in this species? Why do these differences exist? Can you tell me which sex the mystery bird is? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is a juvenile pied harrier, Circus melanoleucos, an Asian raptor that is part of the family Accipitridae. The pied harrier is placed into the genus, Circus, along with 14 of the 17 harrier species. (Two other harriers are in the genus Polyboroides, the harrier-hawks, restricted to the Afrotropics, whilst the one remaining species is placed into monotypic genus, Geranospiza.)  The genus name, Circus, comes from the circling movements that adult birds make when courting.  The pied harrier is strongly sexually dimorphic, with adult females being larger than males, and with both sexes showing strong plumage colour differences. This difference in plumage colour and pattern indicates that females choose their mates based on their plumage pattern, at least in part.  Pied harriers are migratory, breeding in steppes and nearby wetlands stretching from the Amur valley in eastern Russia and north-eastern China to North Korea, and wintering from Pakistan to the Philippines, hunting above rice paddies and marshes. When hunting, harriers fly low over open fields and grasslands with wings angled up into a &quot;V&quot; shape, typically referred to as a dihedral shape. They prey mostly on rodents, lizards, frogs and small birds.  Adult male pied harriers are pale grey with a black head, mantle, back, upper breast and tail coverts and a long silver-grey tail. In flight, the primaries are black above and below, and the black &quot;c&quot; shaped band across the upper wing coverts contrasts sharply with the silvery-grey wings.  Here&apos;s a nice video of an adult male pied harrier, hunting (filmed in Goa, India, in 2005, uploaded 9 April 2010):            Visit upnorthandwild&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  The adult female has brown upperparts and buff-coloured underparts with brown streaks, white thighs, pale underwings with a darker broad trailing edge, long brown tail with darker brown barring, a pale brown face and a white rump patch. The juvenile looks similar to an adult female but has brown underwings and contrasting buff-coloured &quot;spectacles&quot; around its eyes, as visible in this photograph.  This video gives a brief look at a hunting juvenile pied harrier (filmed at Chuping, Perlis, Malaysia on 17 Jan 2010; uploaded 19 January 2010):            Visit digdeep1962&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].

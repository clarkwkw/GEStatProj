    "text": "The New York Times journalist involved in a war of words with US electric car company Tesla Motors over how far its new $101,000 luxury car can go between charges range has hit back over claims he deliberately let the car run out of power. The journalist John M Broder drove the Model S car from Washington DC to New England for a review published last week, in which he recounted having to have the car taken away on a flatbed truck because the car&apos;s battery had run flat, despite a network of fast-charging points designed to make the trip viable. The review sparked a furious response from Tesla&apos;s chief executive, Elon Musk, who subsequently published data logs from the car which he said showed the car &quot;never had a chance with John Broder&quot;.    NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max &amp; took a long detour.&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 11, 2013   But in a blogpost late on Thursday, Broder launched a defence of his review, in which he said he had not set out to &quot;sabotage&quot; it. He denied having deliberately run the battery down by driving &quot;in circles for over half a mile in a tiny, 100-space parking lot&quot; as Musk had claimed, but said he was driving around in the dark looking for a Tesla charging point which was &quot;not prominently marked&quot;. However, Broder was unable to explain why he had claimed to have set the car&apos;s cruise control at 54mph when Tesla&apos;s data logs showed he went &quot;65mph to 81mph for a majority of the trip.&quot; &quot;I do recall setting the cruise control to about 54mph,&quot; Broder wrote in his post, &quot;[but] I cannot account for the discrepancy.&quot; The story also took on a new twist on Thursday as journalists from CNN retraced Broder&apos;s route successfully, saying they had 96 miles of range left on the car&apos;s battery at the end. The car is rated as having a 265 mile range between charges, and the Tesla network of fast-charging points are spaced every 200 miles.    We made it!!1am, but here! @teslamotors S made it with @peterdrives + @jerharlancnn 96 miles to spare! twitter.com/AbigailBassett&mdash; Abigail Bassett (@AbigailBassett) February 15, 2013   Tesla and the NYT&apos;s row has echoes of a BBC Top Gear episode where Jeremy Clarkson drove another Tesla electric car, the Roadster, and showed it running out of power in a race. It led to the company sueing the BBC over the &quot;faked&quot; episode.",

    "text": "Great things were expected. In the run up to E3, there were strong rumours that Microsoft would be unveiling the successor to the Xbox 360. This was followed by speculation that Sony&apos;s hand would be forced and that a PlayStation 4 announcement would be reluctantly cobbled together. It seems now that, unless one of the manufacturers is about to pull off the greatest sleight of hand trick in gaming history, we&apos;re unlikely to see a new generation machine from either. In hardware terms, this leaves the cavernous E3 stage to be dominated by Wii U, Nintendo&apos;s latest grab at the ever-more-difficult-to-define mainstream gaming sector. With its unusual tablet-based GamePad controller and improved IBM multi-core processor, we can expect a neat box of fun, with some cool interface ideas  which will probably be portrayed best by first party titles like New Super Mario Bros Mii, Pikmin 3 and a possible Zelda. It will be interesting to see which third-party publishers clamber aboard the Wii U bus: although Ubisoft is always a sure thing (Assassin&apos;s Creed III is being converted) and we know EA is lining up a couple of titles (Fifa 13 among them). I&apos;m not sure we can expect Black Ops II to be coming over, though. The least we&apos;re hopping for from Nintendo&apos;s conference on Tuesday is a release date, price, some tech specs and some decent launch titles  although it seems the emphasis will be very much on the latter. There&apos;s also the 3DS to support, with Paper Mario, Luigi&apos;s Mansion 2, another Zelda game and Kingdom Hearts 3D all expected to figure. Meanwhile, Sony has its own handheld to support at the show - and lots of pundits are expecting a Vita price cut announcement from the company&apos;s conference on Monday evening. As for games, we know that Call of Duty and Killzone are coming to the device, but what else? Assassin&apos;s Creed 3 is expected in some form  rumours suggest a dedicated spin-off from the main console release is possible. That certainly worked with Uncharted. As for PlayStation 3, the stars are going to be Naughty Dog&apos;s apocalyptic adventure, The Last of Us, and the mysterious new announcement from Heavy Rain creator Quantic Dream. Over at Microsoft, the big games will be Halo 4 (especially its multiplayer mode) and Forza Horizon, the spin-off title being developed by Leamington Spa&apos;s own PlayGround Games. It also looks as though People Can Fly, the developer behind the monstrously under-rated Bulletstorm, are unveiling a Gears of War prequel. After that, we can expect lots of new Kinect titles, and a few fresh content deals with big video-on-demand suppliers. I&apos;m also hoping for a couple of left field XBLA titles to steal the show, a la Limbo a from 2010. The Massively multiplayer battle arena game, Guardians of Middle Earth, which ties in with the forthcoming Hobbit movie, may well attract some interest. And will Microsoft be able to resist at least teasing the next gen Xbox? I doubt it. Among the major publishers, Activision has Black Ops 2, of course, as well as Skylanders Giants; EA will show Fifa 13, Dead Space 3 and Crysis 3; Bethesda has the fascinating stealth game, Dishonored; and Namco has its big new Star Trek title. Warner has just announced Lego lord of the Rings so we can probably expect that. Ubisoft will be showing more of Far Cry 3 and Assassin&apos;s Creed III. On PC, the big titles will be the likes of Elder Scolls Online, DayZ, SimCity and Planetside 2. There are also lots of big free-to-play and MMO publishers at the show this year, while Nvidia is revealing new hardware, including its intriguing new GeForce GRID cloud-based graphics platform.  Theme of the show? Hmm, the calm before the storm, perhaps? There are a lot of titles here that we knew about last year, and a similar sense of stasis from Sony and Microsoft, who have current hardware to push, and perhaps a certain hesitancy about kickstarting a nightmarishly expensive new console generation. Microsoft is up soon though. The battle is about to commence.",

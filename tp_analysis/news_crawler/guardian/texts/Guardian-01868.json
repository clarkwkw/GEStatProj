    "text": "Apple has acquired US apps discovery startup Chomp for a rumoured $50m (32m), as it looks to make it easier for iOS users to find the best iPhone and iPad apps. The news was broken by TechCrunch, which claims that &quot;Apple has bought the Chomp team and technology and plans to use both to completely revamp App Store search and recommendations&quot;. Its story gave no figure for the deal, but Bloomberg has since claimed that Apple paid around $50m for Chomp. Apple has confirmed the acquisition but not the price, with spokeswoman Amy Bessette telling Bloomberg: &quot;We buy smaller technology companies from time to time and generally don&apos;t comment on our purposes or plans.&quot; 9 to 5 Mac has also followed up, claiming that Chomp chief executive Ben Keighran now works for Apple&apos;s iTunes marketing team, while chief technology officer Cathy Edwards is a senior iTunes engineer. At the time of writing, neither had updated their LinkedIn profile accordingly though. Chomp launched its iPhone app in January 2010 as a way for iPhone users to write short reviews of their favourite apps, and then browse a feed of other people&apos;s recommendations. By August of that year it had 400,000 active users, and had added a focus on search. At the time, Keighran described it as the most personalised way to search and browse for apps, adding that: &quot;Apple is insanely excited about this.&quot; The acquisition should help Apple with one of its key challenges: helping iOS users discover apps at a time when there are more than 550,000 available in its App Store. Buying Chomp can also be seen as a vote of no confidence in Apple&apos;s existing Genius technology, at least in the sphere of apps. Originally developed to provide iTunes music recommendations based on people&apos;s existing collections, Genius for apps was introduced in September 2009, suggesting new apps based on previous individual downloads and purchases. Expect Chomp to drop some of its non-iOS services quickly. In March 2011 it launched an Android version of its app, while in September that year it started working with US mobile operator Verizon Wireless on recommendations for its Android app store. It remains to be seen what will happen to Chomp&apos;s standalone iPhone app, although the most likely bet is that it will be pulled from the App Store at some point, before reappearing at some point as an Apple app.",

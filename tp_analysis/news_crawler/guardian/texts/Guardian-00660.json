    "headline": "A challenge to Christopher Booker: try Decc's future energy calculator properly", 
    "text": "Everyone loves a good conspiracy theory. Indeed, some media columnists and commentators seem to make a living from promoting them, and none more so than those prolific scribblers on the climate-denying far-right. Last weekend&apos;s column by the Telegraph pundit Christopher Booker was a glorious textbook example, and especially ironic because the target of his ire  the Department of Energy and Climate Change&apos;s (Decc) new 2050 pathways energy calculator  is in reality a rather interesting and innovative effort at open-minded policy-making, as Damian Carrington wrote recently, and as Booker might have discovered for himself had he bothered to investigate it properly. The irony is particularly clear because Booker&apos;s central complaint is that the Decc 2050 calculator is not sufficiently transparent, and supposedly includes various nefariously hidden assumptions about the relative costs of clean energy and efficiency as compared with fossil fuels. But the truth is that the 2050 work is probably the one of the most open and transparent pieces of policy-making ever undertaken by the British government, where every cost assumption  rather than being shadily hidden  is in fact explicitly described in an open-source wiki which everyone can challenge and contribute to. Booker&apos;s misunderstandings, like his commentary in general, are not original  in this case they come second-hand from the former Ukip press officer-turned-blogger Tim Worstall, whose complaint on the Adam Smith Institute blog is entitled &quot;Perhaps Decc would like to do their sums again&quot;. Worstall&apos;s problem is that he &quot;can&apos;t find the price assumptions they make&quot; about the future costs of fossil fuels. He laments: &quot;I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t find it, just can&apos;t find it at all.&quot; He therefore conspiracy theorises that &quot;the calculation isn&apos;t presented to us&quot; because &quot;we might find that renewables aren&apos;t really an option that anyone would go for.&quot; Whoops. Worstall&apos;s conspiracy evaporates when one discovers that he has simply not clicked on the correct link on the Decc website. To understand the underlying cost assumptions  and tweak them as he wishes  all Worstall has to do is to click on the link to the 2050 web tool on the 2050 pathways calculator page, which would take him to a standard calculator layout with all the options set at the default lowest setting (little energy efficiency, hardly any renewables/nuclear, growth based on fossil fuels, etc). This is what I call the Booker Plan, because it increases greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2050 by about 100 million tonnes per year  in other words it pretends that climate change does not exist, and continues business as usual. So, I hereby challenge Tim Worstall to select an energy pathway of his choice (the Booker do-nothing option is fine) and then click on the link at the top left (&quot;See implications&quot;) and then choose &quot;Cost sensitivity&quot;. Doing so would take him to a page with all the cost assumptions laid out in a table, where anyone can change the default setting to either today&apos;s cost or cheaper (where costs of gas, renewables, nuclear and so on are either assumed to be the same in 2050 as they are now or to get less expensive). Also  if one goes so far as to click the link called &quot;see assumptions&quot;  you can, er, see the assumptions for each fuel source or policy measure. This, if you believe in an open-source approach to data, is where things get interesting. Each cost assumption has its own page (here&apos;s an example for nuclear), with graphs of different estimates from different published sources, and links to those sources and their explanations. If you don&apos;t like the sources, you are able to suggest your own  this is, to the best of my knowledge, the first time that the UK government has opened up its policy-making process to a wiki format. All you have to do  come on, Tim  is register as a user, and then you can add your own data source, providing it is from a reliable source in the published expert literature. Another Booker misunderstanding  that renewables are somehow &quot;contrived&quot; by Decc to appear half as expensive as fossil fuels  also originates with Tim Worstall, though in a different blog post. Thanks to the open-source nature of this whole exercise, you can look at the offending cost-optimising &quot;MARKAL&quot; pathway on the Decc 2050 website, and confirm for yourself that actually it has fairly low selections for renewables  including &quot;no significant solar PV capacity&quot;. All this shows in reality is that energy efficiency is the cheapest way of reducing emissions, which most of us already knew. Incidentally, Friends of the Earth have created their own proposed 2050 pathway, as have I. Theirs includes lots of wave, wind and energy efficiency, and mine  which I of course consider more realistic  has lots of nuclear, less efficiency and wave power but plenty of offshore wind. I also let people live in warmer houses with the thermostat set to 20C, as mine currently is (no, I don&apos;t want to wear another jumper). Both scenarios are equally valid because they add up to an 80% emissions cut by 2050 (in line with UK law as per the Climate Change Act), because their energy-use numbers add up, and because their assumptions are open and transparent. Crucially, this transparency aspect includes their cost assumptions. My pathway comes out a tiny bit cheaper than Friends of the Earth&apos;s despite all the nukes, I am glad to say, but no doubt we could find plenty to argue about in terms of the underlying assumptions. If I tweak their pathway to make solar PV and wave the same price in 2050 as today (assuming, therefore, no cost-reducing innovation), I can inflate their costs still further. If they retaliate by making future nuclear reactors the same price as todays, they win the costs battle. Either way, it is all out in the open, and we can have the argument on the basis of data and real numbers, rather than ideology and assertion. Once again, I invite everyone  solar industry insiders, climate sceptics, everyone  to construct their own pathways. It&apos;s easier than you think. Then compare costs, and assumptions, and emissions. If you think future costs are inherently uncertain (which I do) then click the &quot;uncertain&quot; tab and have the block colours replaced by shaded error bars. None of us really know much about the future. But if we can base today&apos;s policy decisions on what data we have, from the best possible sources, and have as wide a supporting debate as possible in an open-source way, then perhaps we can get beyond the energy culture wars.

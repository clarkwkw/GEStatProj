    "text": "The story of the Chagos islanders&apos; treatment at the hands of the UK government is one for which I am ashamed to be British. It is a story of deceit and tragedy that has been described by some as the darkest day in British overseas policy. It has transfixed me for over a decade and shaken my very principles on conservation and democracy. It is a story of deceit that has left thousands of British refugees living in misery for the last 40 years, exiled from their island home by a conniving and unrepentant government. I have been involved with the plight of the Chagos islanders for a decade, since I became one of a handful of people to illegally visit some of the islands within the atoll. It was eerie walking through the ghost towns. They were frozen in time. The vegetation had smothered many of the buildings, choking the stones in the graveyard. The sunlight streaked through the stained glass windows of the church and the small copra factory remained largely intact. I was horrified to find dozens of international travellers living among the ruins while the islanders themselves remained pariahs, exiled by their own government. Why were these itinerant travellers allowed to stay? Over the years I have got to know a number of Chagos islanders living in forced exile in Manchester, Crawley and in refugee camps in Mauritius. They have little voice, money nor political clout. The case is currently waiting to be heard in the European court of human rights and should come up later this year. Last year I went to a cultural day in Crawley library. Hundreds of Chagossians attended with photos, paintings, diaries and food that represented their dying culture. &quot;We have one dying wish,&quot; said an elderly Chagossian, still traumatised by her forced exile, &quot;to set foot on my island and clear my husband&apos;s grave. Then I can die happy.&quot; As we have seen in recent years, revolution comes from the people, for the people. It only takes a few of us to create a tide of change. In Britain, we all share the guilt over the treatment of these islanders, but we also have the power to change history. We owe it to the Chagos islanders to ensure they have access to the most basic human democratic right, to go home. In April 2010, the UK established a marine nature reserve around the archipelago. According to a cable released by WikiLeaks, a Foreign Office official &quot;asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago&apos;s former residents&quot;, or &quot;man Fridays&quot; as the Chagossians were called. This month, I attended a champagne party to celebrate the Chagos MPA, as the reserve is known. It was a far cry from the wretched situation of the exiled islanders desperate for the right to return home. The marine protectorate is undoubtedly important for conservation science but at what cost? Here, conservation has created refugees. I have had meetings with the Foreign Office and with William Hague and have been campaigning in Washington for an audience with Hillary Clinton to try to right a terrible wrong. We fight tooth and nail to save animals from extinction. Do we not owe it to people to do the same? We cannot let this people and their culture die out.",

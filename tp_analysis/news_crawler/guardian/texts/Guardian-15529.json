    "text": "I&apos;ll deal with &quot;fast fashion&quot; here (the high street&apos;s focus on volume, speed and relatively low cost), because most of us don&apos;t wander around in haute couture. The catch-all term encompasses garments that cost the same as a posh packet of crisps through to upmarket brands that cost a hundred times more. Will moving a few rungs up the fast-fashion price ladder guarantee ethical apparel? In short: no. Not when it comes to the fate of garment workers. The Rana Plaza complex collapsed on 24 April with a death toll of more than 1,100 people. It&apos;s important to remember that Primark, the king of low-cost fashion, was just one of the brands in the frame. Inventory for Benetton and Mango was also found in the factory and those brands are at notably higher price points. Figures from the textile workers&apos; unions in Bangladesh show that doubling the wages of a garment worker in Dhaka would add just 2p to the cost of a T-shirt bought in the UK. So why aren&apos;t brands doing this? The truth is they are either unwilling to or don&apos;t have sufficient control. Western brands use teams of buyers to negotiate with factories and don&apos;t take responsibility for the wages. Instead they negotiate a &quot;freight on board&quot; price  which includes trim, assembly of garment, packaging and delivery. The only price they have specific knowledge of is fabric. The teams negotiate with suppliers on an overall price. The factory then assumes responsibility for paying its garment workers. Unravelling this takes some doing. We do not know how much profit the suppliers make, the size of their orders, what they pay the factories, or what bosses pay their workers. UK academic Doug Miller, who specialises in workers&apos; rights in the fashion industry, has identified several flashpoints in the way brands outsource production. These include buyers who place huge orders in factories without accurately assessing the time needed to make the garment or the efficiency of the factory. The result is that the capacity of the factory is over-estimated and the garment worker is set up to fail. It is time for brands at all price points to open up about costings and take responsibility for paying a living wage. Their action on this, signing up to collective action such as the Bangladesh Fire and Safety Accord, and working with unions on the ground, tells you more than the price tag. Green crush Students love a field trip, and Essex University&apos;s marine biology department has raised the bar, or perhaps submerged it. Students attended their lectures 18 metres underwater at Wakatobi Marine National Park in Indonesia. Professor David Smith used specialised audio equipment  including ahydrophone (underwater microphone)  to teach them about the impact of climate change on coral reefs as they see it with their own eyes. Greenspeak: Industrial organic {in&apos;dstril :gnik} noun Organic fruit and veg grown on large undiversified farms for corporations. For some people, this indicates the hijacking of organic by agribusiness. A local farmer with ruddy cheeks and a pitchfork is no longer a given.

    "text": "It&apos;s May and the end of first year is fast approaching. With new acquaintances and relationships, essay deadlines and exams, it&apos;s hardly surprising that your first year as a student flies by. You begin the year telling yourself  it&apos;s fine, I&apos;m only a fresher. There&apos;s loads of time to get a good grade, build up a CV and become an excellent job applicant. No need to worry. First year is about finding your feet and getting to grips with a new-found independence. There were times when I wanted to go home straight away. I wasn&apos;t sure how I was going to cope with everything  what was I expected to know, how would I be assessed? Adjusting to student life isn&apos;t easy. Perhaps that&apos;s why some choose to leave university altogether. Just over 8% of university students dropped out in the year 2009-10, a rise from 7.9% in the previous year. Evan Drake, a law student who is to graduate this summer, explains that first year can be an overwhelming experience. &quot;The independence is frightening to begin with, exciting once you get used to it and then burdening when you look to the future. It does, however, toughen you up.&quot; But what happens when you&apos;re no longer an innocent fresher? When do you need to start preparing for the future? &quot;You&apos;re here to build a backbone for yourself comprised of skills, networks, knowledge, ambition and direction,&quot; says Evan Drake. Otherwise, you risk wasting your time and money. And this doesn&apos;t mean non-stop study, says Lucy Waldron, a third-year law student. Although working hard has always been on her list of priorities, she says: &quot;The importance of becoming involved in sports clubs and societies should not be underestimated.&quot; Thinking, &quot;I&apos;ve got into university, I have made it,&quot; is silly and nave  being accepted is only the beginning. My first year as a law student has been jam-packed, with studying, friends  and the odd trip home. But I wish I&apos;d spent more time getting to know my flatmates earlier in the year. Only after the Christmas break did we start to spend more time together  now we are friends and not just people who share a kitchen. How was your first year at university? And what are your resolutions for the next one?",

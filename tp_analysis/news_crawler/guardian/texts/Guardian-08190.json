    "text": "Universities have been forced to lower their offer grades in the frantic rush to fill places this summer, and now many vice-chancellors say this was the most &quot;chaotic&quot; and &quot;uncertain&quot; admissions round they have ever experienced. Elite institutions are slamming the government for failing to predict what looks like a dramatic fall in the numbers of top students in the system. Many universities  old and new  have struggled to meet their recruitment targets, and experts warn that some less popular subjects could face the axe. This year, two key policies came on stream at the same time: fees of up to 9,000, and a free market for the very best students, with universities able to recruit as many applicants with grades of AAB upwards as they could attract. Institutions were vying to win more of these students in order to make up for government cuts to their numbers earlier this year. However, early signs are that only a tiny handful of elite institutions have managed to expand. At the top end of the sector, where universities usually have more trouble choosing between students than finding enough of them, institutions, including some of the big northern civic universities, have been hit especially hard. And last week the University of Southampton, a member of the elite Russell Group, revealed that it was 600 students down on last year, having failed to recruit enough AAB students. In an email to all staff, the vice-chancellor, Don Nutbeam, described this as &quot;a wake-up call for the entire university community&quot;. The vice-chancellor of another top research university tells a story that is echoed by many similar institutions: &quot;All of our standard offers were AAB or higher, but we had to drop one grade for some subjects and two for others.&quot; Meanwhile, there are reports that some newer universities have reduced grades to as low as two Ds to boost recruitment. Data confirming the number of students enrolled at different universities is not usually released by Ucas until December, but an update released a week after results day reveals total accepted applicants down by almost 30,000 on last year. One exasperated university head says: &quot;This new admissions environment is not stable, it is not linear, it is, in the real sense of chaos theory, a chaotic environment with all sorts of unintended consequences.&quot; Privately, many VCs report that applicants seem to have underperformed on their predicted grades more than in previous years. And, crucially, selective universities say that the number of students with AAB upwards was noticeably lower. This has come as a real shock. A Westminster source says the data the government was working with was seriously misjudged. &quot;Hefce were asked by the department to predict how many AABs there would be in the system. They looked historically and predicted a 5,000 increase. The reality was more like a 5,000 decrease, which then becomes an effective deficit of 10,000 anticipated AAB students.&quot; One reason for this is that for the first time in two decades the number of students gaining the top grades at A-level did not rise this August. In total, 26.6% were awarded A or A*, a fall of 0.4 points compared with last year. Behind the scenes, leading universities are accusing the government of failing to see the writing on the wall. The head of one top university says: &quot;What this shows is a lack of coordination in government. There were a smaller number of A grades at A-level this year, but the really big question is, did the schools department know this was going to happen and did they tell the universities department?&quot; Yet the small percentage drop in top grades does not explain everything. Another vice-chancellor of a selective university says: &quot;There is a general mystification among admissions professionals about where all these AABs have gone. They seem to have evaporated into thin air.&quot; One theory doing the rounds is that predicted grades for many students were wrong. Experts say this could have been because marking has changed, or because teachers nudged up predictions for borderline cases, knowing that many universities were desperate for extra AAB students for policy reasons this year. The head of one research institution where lots of students with offers didn&apos;t get predicted grades says: &quot;Long before results day, our admissions people said they&apos;d got the impression that teachers were over-predicting grades this year. You can see why. Once you predict an AAB you put a student in a position where any university they apply for might give them an offer.&quot; But Matthew Andrews, registrar at Oxford Brookes University and chair of the admissions practitioners group at the Academic Registrars Council, refuses to believe teachers would play games with grades. He says: &quot;When applications were being written I&apos;m not sure that many people outside the HE sector were aware of the intricacies of the AAB market.&quot; Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the modern universities group million+, which has opposed the AAB policy from the outset, argues that introducing two big recruitment policy changes at once was never going to be a success. &quot;We warned the BIS select committee that the first year of higher fees would be challenging for everyone, and that ministers should pause their ambitions to incentivise the market in student numbers. MPs agreed with us, but by ignoring their advice, the government added an extra layer of unpredictability to the difficulties which already exist in making admissions stack up into a sensible equation.&quot; This year even elite research-intensive universities, including Warwick, Leeds and Durham, were forced into clearing to find extra students. However, Andrews says that a lot of the students counted by Ucas as eligible for clearing haven&apos;t materialised. He explains: &quot;There are some views that this year students applied and it was only afterwards that they really understood the cost and whether they wanted to go to university.&quot; Even universities that have fared reasonably well overall say some subjects have seriously underperformed, notably the humanities, social sciences and modern languages. Some vice-chancellors admit they are thinking hard about whether they can continue to prop up their ailing language courses. Paul Webley, director of the School for Oriental and African Studies, says: &quot;Nationally there has been a huge drop in non-European languages. The difference for us is that these languages are at the core of what we do, so unlike other universities we can&apos;t simply decide to stop doing these things because the numbers are low.&quot; Mike Kelly, professor of French at the University of Southampton and director of the UK Subject Centre for Languages, is pessimistic about what this means for the future. &quot;Some of the universities that have been struggling with languages will be tipped over the edge,&quot; he says. &quot;The real worry is the availability of courses for people who study close to home. There are already very few post-92 universities offering language degrees. If you take Cambridge out of the equation, the east of England is now a total desert.&quot; Most universities can afford to take a knock on numbers this year, with revenue streams such as international students to cushion them and funds in reserve, but they are looking at the next few years with trepidation. Understandably, some say that after the unpredictability of this recruitment round, making calculations about next year will be even harder. One vice-chancellor says: &quot;No one will trust predicted grades. No one will trust anything any longer.&quot; Another concludes: &quot;It is hard to say whether all this pain will be worthwhile, because we don&apos;t yet know whether we&apos;ll be coming out into a future where everything is better. &quot;What I do know is that this is the worst level of uncertainty that I have seen in my 30 years in education.&quot;",

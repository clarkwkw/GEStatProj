    "text": "When the creative powerhouses that are Studio Ghibli and Level-5 collaborate, expectations are high. The former is the animation house behind films including Spirited Away and the latter is an esteemed games developer responsible for the Professor Layton series. Happily, sprawling role-playing game Ni no Kuni is a superb creation, where the player guides the hero, an ordinary boy named Oliver, as he sets out on a dimension-hopping quest to save two intertwined realms. Ni no Kuni, like Ghibli&apos;s finest output, is gloriously animated and set in a distinct universe alive with detail. The orchestral score and character design in particular are a highlight and as a window to escapism, it offers access to a land that is charming but never maudlin, suitable for adults and youngsters alike. But it won&apos;t be for everyone. Like many Japanese RPGs, mechanically Ni no Kuni is an intricate beast, where convoluted combat systems and much virtual conversation dominate the action. Level 5 has succeeded in making the game particularly accessible, even for RPG newcomers, without diluting what defines the genre, but be warned: to get the most from this outstanding and exceedingly lengthy release, an immense commitment is needed.",

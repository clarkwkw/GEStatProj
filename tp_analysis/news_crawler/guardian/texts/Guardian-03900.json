    "text": "Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Rights Human rights abuses have the stereotype of being seen to happen in some far flung corner of the world, or else occur in some kind of hidden underbelly of society. Yet they can, and do, occur almost literally in our back gardens. Flamenco dancing as we know it owes much to the Gypsy and Roma community. Django Reinhardt was a Belgian Sinto Gypsy and one of Europe&apos;s first great jazz musicians. Gypsy culture is built upon strict codes of cleanliness learnt over centuries of life on the road. Concepts such as mokadi and mahrime provide strict guidelines, detailing, for example, what objects can be washed in what bowls. And Gypsies have been present in Britain for at least 500 years. Yet so many still seem to think of them as an invading, uncivilised, dirty force, setting out to wreck people&apos;s livelihoods and their cultures. Evidence would seem to suggest that the attack comes from the opposite direction. Programmes such as Big Fat Gypsy Weddings have been criticised by people such as Roma author and teacher Dr Ian Hancock, and in the words of filmmaker Yale Strom: &quot;When entertainment of any kind feeds the public&apos;s false stereotypical image of a particular ethnic, religious or racial group it only reinforces ignorance.&quot; This is exactly what such programmes do. More than this, one of the many victims of the cuts was the maintenance of official Traveller sites in Britain. But the main issue concerning the abuse of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller rights should perhaps be the common source of these abuses  a lack of knowledge and understanding from childhood about this culture. Casual racism and name-calling may not seem to be such a major abuse of human rights, when far more dramatic horrors occur all over the world. But it is still abuse. And it is right in front of us, in a so-called civilised society. A Children&apos;s Society survey in 2007 found that eight out of 10 Gypsy and Traveller children have suffered racial abuse and almost two thirds have been bullied or physically attacked. Terms such as &quot;pikey&quot; fall frighteningly easily from the lips of otherwise amiable people. And if cultural conception of an entire culture is affected by programmes and myths which seem to focus on the worst, it does not look as though either understanding or acceptance is going to make any headway. An old Traveller woman and her husband come to our village sometimes, to sharpen blades in return for old clothes. Doors and windows shut in their faces, like something out of Victor Hugo&apos;s The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The Nazis killed about 25% of European Roma. Of slightly less than a million before the war, up to 220,000 were killed. Yet as a culture we are developing. For the first time in British history, the March 2011 census acknowledged Gypsy, Roma and Traveller as a separate ethnic group. Perhaps equality is not too far away.",

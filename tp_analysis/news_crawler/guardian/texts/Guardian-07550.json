    "text": "    Historically, insect collecting was (and still is) a widespread and very popular educational hobby. But the earliest insect collectors weren&apos;t professional entomologists -- they were hobbyists.    Herman Strecker was a sculptor who lived in Pennsylvania from 1836 to 1901. But his art was not what gave him lasting fame. Instead, it was his hobby. Beginning when he was a teenager, Mr Strecker collected and studied butterflies and moths. Swapping specimens with scientists and specialists around the world brought him into contact with some of the most notable people of his day, such as Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia. Although considered an amateur by today&apos;s standards, Mr Strecker named and described 251 different species of butterflies and moths, mostly in a book he illustrated and published in parts from 1872 to 1900. By the time he died, Mr Strecker had amassed the largest and most important collection of butterflies and moths in the Americas, comprising more than 50,000 specimens. In 1908. the Field Museum in Chicago purchased this collection along with several thousand letters between Strecker and other leading naturalists of the day. In this interesting video, Collection Manager Jim Boone tells us a little about the history of the moth and butterfly collection held by the Field Museum in Chicago and shows us some its most interesting specimens.

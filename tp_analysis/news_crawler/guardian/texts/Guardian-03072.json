    "text": "The recent high winds sadly battered the blossom on the fruit trees; the damsons, not so far forward as some other trees, suffered least, and the beautiful wild cherries were, perhaps most damaged. But wind is not the only enemy of young shoots and flowers. A visitor to Colwyn Bay noticed that the ground beneath one horse chestnut was littered with fresh shoots, each carrying leaves and spikes of flower buds. At first, he blamed the wind, but closer investigation showed that the destruction was actually being continued, and that the destroyers were squirrels. I have before me a number of these shoots, and all have been attacked in the same way. From the base of the flower stalk, for about an inch and half to two inches, the fleshy inside portion, or &quot;wood,&quot; has been scooped out, leaving only a strip of skin, but the flower spike and tuft or two of leaves have been dropped untouched. Evidently the squirrel knows the sweetest tit-bit, and throws away the rest; it reminds one of a child eating from the top of cake and leaving the remainder.  BRITISH HERONRIES - Mr Frank Bonnett writes from Mockbeggar Reading: - Would you be kind enough to make public my willingness to send to anyone interested a copy of my list of British heronries revised to date? I would again ask all correspondents sending particulars of heronries to state the number of nests occupied, age of heronry (if known), and whether the colony is increasing or otherwise.",

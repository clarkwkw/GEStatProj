    "text": "Journey has won this year&apos;s GameCity prize. The downloadable PlayStation title, in which players control a mysterious character on a quest through a haunting desert landscape, beat six other shortlisted titles to claim the award.  The prize was judged by a panel of writers and broadcasters from outside the games industry, including Lord Puttnam, comic book artist Dave Gibbons, Financial Times journalist Lucy Kellaway and DJ Jo Whiley. The aim of the annual competition, which takes place as part of Nottingham&apos;s GameCity festival is to highlight interesting titles and to encourage debate and discussion about the state of game design.  &quot;All of the Jury commented on the art direction in particular, the extraordinary sense of size and scale it portrayed,&quot; said Lord Puttnam. &quot;Whilst it was a short game, it was in no way small. It&apos;s a focused, detailed piece of work - challenging you to measure it in terms other than just the length of gameplay. One of the jury commented that it was like a favourite place, a walk in the country, that she would love to go back and revisit&quot;. Created by US developer thatgamecompany, Journey was released on Playstation 3 in March and drew widespread critical acclaim for its beautiful visuals, haunting soundtrack and elusive, thought-provoking design. It beat other well-receieved titles such as Proteus, Mass Effect 3 and Fez. Commenting on the win, the creative director of thatgamecompany, Jenova Chen said: &quot;I really like the goal of GameCity, to get people to notice games and talk about games, particularly for people who don&apos;t encounter many video games in their daily life. Thatgamecompany has always focused on making games for everyone, so it&apos;s nice to see GameCity recognize our game and give us an award. In the end, we believe that games are a mature media that deserve to be enjoyed and loved by everyone, by people&quot;. Journey joins last year&apos;s victor Minecraft and the offbeat duo have set a tone for what some have referred to as gaming&apos;s answer to the Turner or Booker prizes. The GameCity festival continues until Saturday with a range of talks, showcases and evening events.",

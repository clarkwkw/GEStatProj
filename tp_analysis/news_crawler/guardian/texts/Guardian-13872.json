    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Gears Of War has a formula and Judgement isn&apos;t going to mess with it: one of your ludicrously proportioned musclemen kicks open a door to find a room littered with waist-high barriers; aliens with guns arrive; using the barriers as cover you shoot them all into meaty chunks before moving on. Although this was in place for previous instalments it&apos;s never felt as rigid as it does here, though there are novelties, including sections where you place gun turrets to help defend fortified positions  a feature that transfers nicely to multiplayer. It&apos;s great fun while it lasts, but both Judgement and Aftermath (an extra, unlockable mini-campaign) feel less like a full game and more like a slightly extended piece of downloadable content, offering more of the same before suddenly ending without fanfare or ceremony.",

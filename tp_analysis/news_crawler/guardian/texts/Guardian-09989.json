    "text": "Every morning, mile upon mile of women stream along Dhaka&apos;s roadsides, heading towards the city&apos;s garment factories. This urban workforce is now the largest contributing group to Bangladesh&apos;s vital export economy. In a country with more than 4,000 factories  which now relies on the ready-to-wear garment industry for 80% of its export income  women have become a powerful economic force. About 1.5 million women are employed as garment workers, and their labour has allowed the Bangladeshi garment industry to compete seriously in the global market. Employment in the export-oriented garment industry, and in other industries such as electronics manufacturing, has directly opened up the labour market for poorer sections of the population, most notably young rural women with limited local employment options. For many of these women, a move from the country to the city has brought an economic independence that would have been almost inconceivable to earlier generations. Their migration has been one of the most visible signs of the rapid urbanisation in Bangladesh, where the urban population is growing by roughly 6% year-on-year and 28% of people now live in cities. The total urban population is expected to reach 50 million by 2015. Many women are contributing to the family and national income for the first time. Money is returning to the countryside as women working in the cities send remittances to their families. At the same time, urbanisation is slowly changing women&apos;s status as their economic role becomes more established. &quot;The mass migration of largely very poor women from the countryside to the cities to work in industries like the garment sector is seeing a cultural shift start to take place,&quot; says Fayaz Ahmad, a senior manager at ActionAid Bangladesh. &quot;It [Migration] is helping raise the status of women in their families and home communities because they are becoming visible earners. Urbanisation has brought different opportunities to women and, as a result, the idea of girls getting an education and having jobs instead of getting married early is growing. The idea that women can be police officers, doctors, drivers is slowly taking hold.&quot; Yet even as urbanisation has galvanised women&apos;s march towards greater economic freedom, the equality and safety of Bangladesh&apos;s new workers are still major issues. In the garment industry, women are an easy target for exploitation and discrimination. With an average age of 19, usually unmarried and with little education or training, many women enter urban employment with a comparative disadvantage in terms of pay, working conditions, the possibility of promotion and even getting paid for overtime. They earn 60% of the salary of male colleagues. According to a 2003 report (pdf) by the Centre for Policy Dialogue and UN Population Fund, there is a clear link between the increased sexual harassment of Bangladeshi women and their improved economic status, increased mobility and newfound visibility away from the home. A 2011 War on Want report (pdf) on the Bangladesh garment industry found that 297 out of a total of 998 women workers interviewed reported unwanted sexual advances, while 290 said they had been touched inappropriately. A further 328 reported &quot;threats of being forced to undress&quot;, while almost half said they had been beaten and hit in the face by their supervisors. Sexual harassment of women on the street and in urban schools is on the increase, according to Bangladeshi NGO Brac, which in 2010 launched Mejnin, a project to tackle the increasing harassment of women and girls. Mejnin now works with 20,000 adolescent girls of school age in Dhaka. At a school on the outskirts of Dhaka, a Mejnin counsellor is running a session for 14- and 15-year-old girls. She says instances of sexual harassment are increasing rapidly in urban areas, where there are few legal or other support structures for adolescent girls. Teachers in this secondary school have seen girls dropping out of class because they are harassed on their way to school. Some parents are keen to marry off their daughters early as a way to protect them. &quot;Many of these girls come from very conservative and rural families and this is a huge problem for them,&quot; says Safiqul Islam, director of the Brac education programme. &quot;We&apos;ve found that the harassment has increased as communities have become more fragmented.&quot; He says problems arise as people move from towns and villages where everyone knows each other into urban centres where traditional community support structures simply don&apos;t exist. &quot;At the same time, it still isn&apos;t normal to see large numbers of girls out on the streets without male relatives,&quot; he says. &quot;To some extent, our society is still catching up to the changes that urbanisation has brought.&quot; Back at the school, 14-year-old Tahmina Aktar offers her own solution to the problem of harassment. &quot;We have to learn how to be strong and that we have equal rights to be on the street as men,&quot; she says. &quot;One boy was giving me big problems on the way to school, so one day I turned round and told him I would punch him in the nose if he talked to me that way again. He stopped after that.&quot;",

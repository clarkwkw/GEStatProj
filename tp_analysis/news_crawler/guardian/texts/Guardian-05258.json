    "text": "Adults and children are being urged to take part in what is set to be the UK&apos;s largest beach clean-up, as a leading conservation charity warns of the long-term risk to marine life from the huge volume of litter swamping the oceans and being washed up onto shores. Plastics make up over half the rubbish retrieved, and pose the biggest single threat to wildlife such as turtles, fish and seabirds  and the volume of plastic bottles and tops, bags and ropes has increased by 135% since records began in 1994, according to the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). The charity launched a regular annual weekend beach clean in the same year  the so-called Beachwatch Big Weekend  but this year is teaming up for the first time with retail giant Marks &amp; Spencer to oversee organised litter-picking sessions at 150 beaches across the UK at the end of May. It hopes that the current record turnout of 5,000 people could be even bigger as a result of the new collaboration. MCS warns that litter is swamping our oceans  where it is largely unseen  before being washed up on beaches. MCS measures it by density, last year reporting nearly 2,000 items of rubbish for every kilometre of beach. New figures are due to be published on 22 March. An MCS spokesman said: &quot;It kills wildlife, looks disgusting, is a hazard to our health and costs millions to clear up. According to last year&apos;s Beachwatch report, over half of all litter found was found was made of plastic, which may take thousands of years to fully break down and generally doesn&apos;t leave the marine environment. &quot;Marine wildlife gets entangled in litter and accidentally ingests it. Turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and the bags block their stomachs, often leading to death from starvation. Seabirds mistake floating plastic litter for food, and over 90% of fulmars [a species of seabird] found dead around the North Sea have plastic in their stomachs.&quot; The May clean-up is part of M&amp;S&apos;s environmental initiative Plan A, which saw a 5p charge introduced for plastic bags in 2008, cutting use by 80% and raising over 4 million for charity. As an incentive, customers who register in advance for the clean-up will receive a money-off M&amp;S voucher and a free M&amp;S lunch on the day. Free beach activity packs can be downloaded for children, and at six larger beaches  including Heacham in north Norfolk, Hazelbank near Belfast and Cramond near Edinburgh  there will be a free barbecue and kids&apos; games. Marc Bolland, chief executive of M&amp;S, who will be helping out at Heacham, said: &quot;We rely on our beaches as places to have fun and relax and we rely on our seas to provide us with fish for us to eat, yet we pollute them by allowing them to become landing points for all sorts of rubbish. We hope that as many beach cleaners  big and small  will come down to our beaches. Together we can make a real difference, and encourage the next generation to care passionately about protecting our beaches and seas for the future.&quot;",

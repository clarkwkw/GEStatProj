Here&apos;s our plan; we&apos;d like you to come along for the ride. But if you choose not to, we won&apos;t hesitate to leave you behind.&apos;&quot;  Post-SOPA: the path forward for addressing piracy &gt;&gt; Ars Technica A long read, but worth chewing over in full:   &quot;These measures won&apos;t put an end to online piracy; to do so, you would need a &apos;Net so architected around control and authentication that it would hardly resemble the &apos;Net we have today. Can a plan on the lines proposed cause the jolly pirates running The Pirate Bay to scuttle their boat? Possibly not. Will it provide a simple way to take down specific live streams of sporting events in real time? No.&quot;  The story behind Rupert Murdoch&apos;s rants about Google and SOPA &gt;&gt; Forbes  At one point, according to sources with knowledge of the events, the presenter [at CES] was explaining the different ways to find content within Google TV: You can go through a &quot;Shows and Movies&quot; app that catalogs offerings from Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, etc., or else you can use standard browser-based Google Search. Murdoch asked what would happen if he were to search for a particular blockbuster film, and the presenter explained that the results would be the same ones you&apos;d find in any Google search. Including links to content-pirating sites? Murdoch pressed. Yes, unless those sites have already been removed from search results in response to takedown requests, the presenter confirmed.   Murdoch took exception to that answer. Then he took to Twitter.   Given his existing antipathy to Google, unsurprising. Why the video pros are moving away from Apple &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  &quot;Which came first: Apple&apos;s creative pro market shrinking, which might have led to dramatic changes in Final Cut Pro; or Apple&apos;s cavalier attitude toward legacy features, which might have frightened video editors? According to the professionals we spoke to, there was already signs of an industry shift to Avid before FCPX came along, but Apple still had a very loyal and dedicated user base that it&apos;s now turning away from.   &quot;&apos;The perception here is that Apple is more concerned with selling iPads and iPhones than they are with the people who have stuck with them since the 90&apos;s, the professional editors and VFX people,&apos; said Jude Mull, who works at a post-production facility in Hollywood that processes and digitizes some of your favorite TV shows.&quot;   Final Cut Pro X is looking for professionals like iMovie 8 did for amateurs - a refit too far. Professionals have alternatives, however - such as Avid. Grooveshark subpoenas Digital Music News for confidential whistleblower Information &gt;&gt; Digital Music News  &quot;Grooveshark attorneys are now exerting heavy legal pressure on Digital Music News, with the goal of outing a very problematic whistleblower. Just this weekend, our offices received a mountain of subpoena paperwork from Grooveshark attorneys McPherson Rane LLC, a Los Angeles-based firm headed by celebrity lawyer Ed McPherson. The aggressive and broad-reaching subpoena is designed to force the disclosure of the identity of the anonymous whistleblower&quot;.   That would be the commenter who alleged last October that Grooveshark employees are assigned a predetermined amount of material to upload - perhaps illicitly - to the site. If something &quot;known&quot; gets removed from the site, the commenter said, the internal task is to re-upload it. Digital Music News is resisting. Grooveshark, meanwhile, is being sued by all the major record companies. Tell Gove what you think (the easy way) &gt;&gt; Emma Mulqueeny  &quot;This is a very important consultation and opens a whole new door to open education and should not be ignored. But the consultation is in the formal format and requires you to answer specific questions, and not see what anyone else has said.   &quot;So, Craig Snowden @CraigSnowedIn, a 17 year old developer from Scotland who answered a twitter call to open the consultation, popped it into Google docs.   &quot;In Google docs you can read and comment, and see others&apos; comments, and properly understand what this might be saying.   &quot;Now, this is not the formal process, but there is no reason why the comments cannot be fed into the formal process and I will volunteer to do that.&quot;   All of a part with the Guardian&apos;s Digital Literacy campaign - get stuck in. iPad still on top as tablet competition heats up &gt;&gt; Boy Genius Report  &quot;While the iPad&apos;s lead in the tablet market is obvious, it&apos;s becoming more clear there&apos;s strong competition for market share below it. The Amazon Kindle Fire represented an average of 2.4 ad impressions on Chitikas network for every 100 iPad impressions, but RIM&apos;s BlackBerry PlayBook wasn&apos;t far behind; it viewed an average of 1.8 ad impressions for every 100 iPad impressions on Chitika&apos;s mobile ad network.&quot;   Wow, that sounds incredible! Really hotting up! Chitika&apos;s graph for tablet ad impressions, this time WITH the iPad... &gt;&gt; Flickr Oh, OK then. We&apos;ll stop doing the BGR links now. Did Google-run computers taint rival mapping project? &gt;&gt; CNET News  &quot;Google had this to say about the OpenStreetMap incident: &apos;The two people who made these changes were contractors acting on their own behalf while on the Google network. They are no longer working on Google projects.&apos;   &quot;And a source familiar with Google&apos;s actions said the two were terminated because they used Google&apos;s network for unauthorized activity, which is against Google&apos;s rules, not because of what they actually did on their own initiative.&quot;   So yes, they were people working for Google. But they weren&apos;t doing this for Google, if that&apos;s clear. They weren&apos;t &quot;Google-run computers&quot;; they were Google-briefly-employed staff.

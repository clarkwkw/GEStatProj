    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Despite being almost destroyed during its development, with a clone by a rival developer released months earlier, Ridiculous Fishing is a work of perfection. It&apos;s divided into three phases. First, you cast your hook into the sea, letting it drift downwards, tilting your iPhone to avoid fish, crabs, squid and the game&apos;s catalogue of made-up ocean fauna (the geometric graphics are witty, even rather chic). Then, once you&apos;ve caught something, your lure rises back to the surface, and this time your job is to hook as much as you can. And at the surface, your fish are catapulted into the air, where you shoot them to pieces, earning money only when each has been blasted to a fine crimson pulp. Ridiculous, yes, but also astoundingly compelling, especially when you start spending money in the game&apos;s shop, buying longer fishing lines, more powerful guns and electrical goods to stun your prey should you touch a fish on the way down. Brilliantly realised foolishness.",

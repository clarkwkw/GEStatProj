    "text": "Dr Suwan Jayasinghe discusses his work at University College London, where his team is engineering at the cellular level to create tissues that will one day repair or replace whole organs. Dr Jayasinghe will be one of the speakers at the Electromagnetic Field festival, a science and tech camp that runs from Friday 31 August to Sunday 2 September at Pineham Park, Milton Keynes. Aleks Krotoski from our sister podcast Tech Weekly meets one of its founders, Jonty Wareing.  Also on the show: Professor Polly Roy from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine talks about her decades working to build synthetic versions of the Bluetongue virus, which affects cattle and sheep. She explains how techniques for synthesising viruses can not only lead to vaccines for protecting animals but also have profound implications for combating human pathogens.

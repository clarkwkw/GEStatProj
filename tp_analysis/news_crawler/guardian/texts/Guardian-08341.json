    "text": "The first clue is a large round hole at ground level in the hedge separating a ploughed field and a beech wood. The second is a neat pair of latrines  badgers are organised creatures that take their bathroom breaks seriously. A quick scramble through the brambles and the sett is found. It&apos;s a yawning hole in a sandy bank, partly hidden by ferns. &quot;I love the entrances, some of them are so grand,&quot; says Kayleigh. &quot;It&apos;s amazing to think of the creatures living underneath us. This is gorgeous.&quot; But this is no carefree nature trek. Kayleigh and her four companions are here, on Wednesday, on serious business: to map out the setts within the badger cull zone so that if  or when  the shooting begins, activists know where they need to be to make the job of the marksmen just about impossible. &quot;We plan to be here with loudhailers, bright lights, high-visibility jackets. They want to try to do the cull quietly. We aren&apos;t going to let them,&quot; says Kayleigh. Reluctantly, she admits the task is tricky. The cull zone is hundreds of square kilometres of fields, woods, hills and valleys in Gloucestershire and Somerset. &quot;But I&apos;m confident that we&apos;ll get enough people out to find out where the culling is taking place and stop it,&quot; she says. Kayleigh (she does not reveal her full name) seems to be right that something big is stirring in the countryside. It is no surprise to find that people like her  a veteran of the last badger culling during the Krebs trials which ran from 1998 to 2008  are involved. Nor that groups such as the Hunt Saboteurs Association are calling on members to take direct action. But there also seems to be a growing swell of anger from the sort of people who might normally be content just to sign a petition or write a letter to a newspaper. These people, too, seem intent on heading out into the country to take part in disrupting the culls. People from all corners of the UK have promised to be there, at the sites, to stop the shooting. Campaign leaders are trying to set up temporary campsites in the cull zones and are also asking sympathisers to open up spare rooms in their homes to protesters. It also seems clear from the excellent information the activists have that some local farmers and possibly even civil servants opposed to the cull are doing their bit to help by leaking information. &quot;We&apos;re getting interest from people who haven&apos;t been involved in animal rights or activism before,&quot; says Kayleigh. &quot;They see this cull as morally wrong and illegal and are determined to help stop it.&quot;            For now, it is all about careful preparation. Groups and individuals are organising themselves, many under the banner of Stop the Cull, which uses the website badger-killers.co.uk. They are laying down stocks they might need, from loudhailers (and vuvuzelas, the horns that made such a racket at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa) to fireworks and high-powered flashlights. And they are carrying out the painstaking process of making sure they know the location of the setts. As the activists carried on their work a couple of carloads of people set out on reconnaissance in the Somerset part of the zone. Fortified by juice and Bourbon biscuits, Kayleigh and the team start out on a little-used footpath passing through a boggy wood. Three of them, experienced badger trackers, dart off in all directions looking for runs that will lead to them to setts. Two are new to the game and, patiently, are taught what to look out for  small but clear paths through the undergrowth, snags of fur on fences, those tell-tale latrines. They are also told how to spot evidence that other humans have been looking for setts. Kayleigh says that in readiness for the cull, surveyors have been leaving strands of barbed wire in the woods intending to snag badger fur so they can track the animals. Activists are also told to look out for rocks or stones that seem out of place; the cullers have been planting peanuts, which badgers love, to get the animals used to moving through areas where the marksmen can lie in wait. The group finds footprints in a muddy bank, but they are judged to be deer. The wood doesn&apos;t feel &quot;very badgery&quot;  a little too damp  so the group tramps through a field up to higher, more promising ground. This is Lara&apos;s first taste of activism. A volunteer at a rescue centre, she is absolutely opposed to the cull. &quot;Rather than just sitting around and moaning about it, I wanted to do something to help,&quot; she says. &quot;If the cull happens I will be there with these guys.&quot; Ken, a young care worker who helps elderly people, says that he grew up in a village in Wiltshire and grew disillusioned at the methods farmers were using. &quot;It seems to be all about shaping the countryside not to protect it but to maximise their profits,&quot; he says. Like Lara, he vows to be out at night when the cull begins, doing all he can to stop it. &quot;I&apos;m still hoping it won&apos;t come to that but I will be back here if it does.&quot; As the team climbs the field they mark down badger runs through the hedges on an Ordnance Survey map. They are keeping everything on paper, fearful that if the information is put on to a computer it could get into the wrong hands and be used by those who wish badgers harm. They exchange stories about badgers  how some of the creatures&apos; runs have followed the same routes for centuries, how rows of cherry trees sometimes mark the boundary between clan territories because the fruit-loving animals mark out the edge of their areas with their latrines, depositing the cherrystones to root. The discovery of a sett in the beech wood is the highlight of the day. But then comes a low point. A stinking badger corpse lies just 100 metres from the sett, a spent shotgun shell beside it. &quot;That brings it home to me how important it is to be involved,&quot; says Lara. A question people such as Lara and Ken will have to face is how far they will go to save the badgers. Kayleigh is coy when asked if she was one of those who cut through traps during the Krebs trial. &quot;Maybe,&quot; she says. She is relaxed at the idea of the names, addresses and phone numbers of those involved in the cull, from politicians to those organising the shooting, being published. &quot;They are involved in something illegal. Why should their identities remain secret?&quot; Kayleigh also says she is not bothered if more hardline campaigners carry out criminal acts such as sabotaging bank machines of supermarkets that do not come out against the cull, as one group has threatened to do. &quot;I won&apos;t be losing any sleep over that.&quot; By late afternoon the group calls it a day and head home. Some have long journeys ahead of them. All vow to return this week or at the weekend  and be ready when the shooting begins.",

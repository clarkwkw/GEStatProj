Click here to view Assassin&apos;s Creed III: Liberation takes place in New Orleans, joining its console-based big brother in revolution-era America and featuring the series&apos; first female protagonist Aveline de Grandpr. As well as the usual climbing and stabbing skills, Aveline also dons disguises: as a slave she blends in with labourers; as an assassin she&apos;s better in combat; and as a lady she can charm or bribe guards. Disappointingly, the game usually railroads you into choosing one outfit, leaving you simply to get on and slit a few throats. There&apos;s a bit of the bayou to explore, though not a lot to do, and things suffer when the action gets intense. Still, Liberation looks beautiful on the Vita.",

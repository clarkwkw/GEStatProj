    "text": "Your progress report on Michael Gove&apos;s education policy (The school revolution in England, 11 April) spends a huge amount of column space on the achievements of just two schools. It would have been just as easy to praise the achievements of community and voluntary schools that have improved as much as Harris Norwood. Although the article recognises some issues, such as concern over exclusions, it leaves the reader with the sense that Norwood and Barnfield are typical products of Gove&apos;s policies and that there is no other route to improvement. With a different selection of examples, you could present a quite different picture. Take John Paul II in Wandsworth  improving just as fast but with only one-third the number of more able pupils. Or St Paul&apos;s Way in Tower Hamlets, improving nearly as fast with four times the number of pupils receiving free meals. Neither is an academy. What the article should have been doing is looking at serious statistical evidence which now shows clearly that in 2011 the status of the school made no difference to pupils&apos; achievement when you look across the whole school system. It should also have looked at National College research which shows that schools in academy chains actually have less freedom, not more, about what and how they teach. The tragedy is that arguing about structures is a complete red herring and is distracting us from trying to understand what it is that successful schools of all kinds do to make a difference.John BoltLondon Your special report features Moorlands school in Luton, which has been a successful crammer for the independent schools in Bedford for many years. Your article unfortunately neglects to add that, since September, the pupils&apos; parents no longer have to pay the annual fees of 6,500, yet the headteacher, Andrew Cook, has stated that class numbers will not exceed 18. So taxpayers will now fund a private school&apos;s selective intake; just one of Gove&apos;s many &quot;vanity projects&quot;, part of a 337m spend on academies and free schools in the past 18 months.David BexonDunstable, Bedfordshire Referring to his research findings regarding academies under Labour, Stephen Machin points out that &quot;over an eight-year period, we found improvements in the quality of the intake and in GCSE performance&quot; (Stop twisting our research for your purposes, 10April). He does not elaborate on what he means by &quot;improving the quality of the intake&quot;, but seems unintentionally to have endorsed one of the fundamental flaws and injustices of the English education system. Academies under Labour had a freer hand in selecting their intake. Gove academies have an even freer hand. Improving a school&apos;s performance by improving its intake does not improve the education system  it simply makes it easier for a school to appear good in league tables. To improve educational outcomes for the whole school-aged population requires an approach that ceases to treat children as market commodities for competing schools, but focuses on supporting and encouraging the teaching profession to share best practice towards teaching all children what they are entitled to learn. The academies programmes, whether New Labour or the coalition variety, cannot do this.Keith LichmanSecretary, Campaign for State Education Peter Wilby is right to point out the potential long-term dangers of Gove&apos;s headlong rush to turn schools into academies (Teachers get angry every year. Now it is time to listen, 9 April). What he omits to mention is the current issue of funding for academies. The Department for Education forecasts that, between 2011 and 2013, it will allocate just over 1bn to academies in addition to their normal funding. To fund this, 415m has been top-sliced from local authority budgets, causing them to make significant cuts in services. This still leaves 600m unaccounted for. Has this allegedly impoverished government really got sums like this stashed away to pander to one minister&apos;s obsession? Most schools converting to academy status have in effect been bribed to do so. In a time of limited resources it is understandable that they want to grasp whatever money is up for grabs, but as a coherent and equitable policy for funding schools it is nonsensical.Peter DownesVice-president, Liberal Democrat Education Association Peter Wilby points to Gove and his fellow ministers as the &quot;guilty men&quot; fostering the breakup of the state education system. But there are many other guilty men and women  those collaborating headteachers who have willed the end of local democratic involvement in education by taking the 30 pieces of silver offered as an inducement to take up academy status.Professor Colin RichardsSpark Bridge, Cumbria In Fiona Millar&apos;s article (Time to debunk some myths about schools, 10April), she states that the only party that is publicly committed to reintroducing a schooling that stamps the majority of children as failures aged 11 is Ukip. It is also supported by the Democratic Unionist and the Unionist parties, and this ensures that selection and rejection thrives in Northern Ireland. About 70 Northern Ireland schools (both Catholic and Protestant) continue to select children, despite the stated wish of the Sinn Fein minister of education. Many of us agree with the new chief inspector&apos;s comment that &quot;we don&apos;t want a secondary modern school, we want a comprehensive school&quot;. However, over here, wedon&apos;t have that choice.Kevin ScallyDrumman Heights, Armagh Fiona Millar is absolutely spot-on to draw attention to the gap between the closure of Hackney Downs school and the foundation of Mossbourne Community academy. It is quite wrong to assume the former school  which gave us kidney transplants, atomic scientists and Harold Pinter (by way of example) was a bad school. It had been manipulated in its decline by many vested interests. All Mossbourne has done is to reinstate the values for which HDS (founded by the Grocers&apos; Company) was once a byword. Hackney Downs 1876-1995: The Life and Death of a School, by Geoffrey Alderman, just published, makes this very clear.GL WatkinsWhittlebury, Northants Professor Machin says that the secretary of state is using the data on academies started by Labour (203) to make the case for the 1,432 new academies (Stop twisting our research for your purposes, 10 April). This is wrong. The way statistics are selected should be a question of fact, not convenience, even for ministers. Michael Gove has his own agenda. In Sheffield, for example, the results for 5+ GCSEs at grades A-C range from 30% for Park Wood academy and 35% at Newfield school to 69% for High Storrs and 75% for Silverdale. This reflects the social mix of schools, since it is well known that Sheffield is one of the most socially divided cities in England, with very affluent areas to the south-west. Defining a school as an academy will not change that and neither will it help the examination performance of its pupils much (as evidence has shown). What is now on offer is extra money for high-performing schools to become academies, so that the private sector can move in. So governors at Tapton school said that if the school became an academy, this would attract an extra 750k in funding, an offer they could not refuse. The secretary of state has arranged it that the governors make these decisions, not the parents or teachers, and therefore the vocal opposition of parents at, for example, Bradfield school was ignored. If the governors don&apos;t have the right sort of views, as in Downhills school in Haringey, they are sacked and replaced by governors who favour the private sector. The new academy system is a tool to wrest schools from local council control and make education a marketplace with winners and losers. We should support all our children in our schools and not turn schools into a business.Dr David DrewSheffield The current education secretary&apos;s plans seem to be borne out of desire to turn the education system back 30 years where schools were simply exam factories with little regard to children&apos;s wellbeing. Children have very different learning styles, with some being suited to examinations and others benefiting from assessment through coursework. Coursework allows children to show sustained academic achievement in a less pressured environment than exams. Last year YoungMinds&apos; helpline for parents took more calls than ever before from parents concerned about their child struggling from exam stress. Michael Gove&apos;s reforms will only exacerbate children&apos;s stress levels as their futures are decided in a few hours in an examination hall. More children struggling with stress can only lead to more children developing mental health problems. The purpose of schools should be as much about measuring academic attainment as about nurturing children through their most turbulent years and providing them with support to develop emotionally. Recreating a purely exam-based system will place large numbers of young people who can&apos;t manage exams under increased stress. It will also mean less young people passing exams with the resultant loss of self-esteem and confidence, risking increases in uncertain futures, decreased wellbeing and mental health problems.Lucie RussellDirector of campaigns and policy, YoungMinds The negative effects of the Gove school revolution are now coming to the surface (Editorial, 10 April). The speedy passage of the 2010 Academies Act allowed Michael Gove to avoid comment over the implications. The seductive promise, implicit in the Blair academies, of higher GCSE results from autonomous schools and a lack of scrutiny of how these schools worked was enough to create a wall of silence over the academy and free school project. The press largely ignored both the evidence of increased social segregation in the US and Sweden, and the dictatorial implications of a centralised power system which has become dogma for all parties. But at least Labour did respond to criticisms that money was becoming alarmingly difficult to trace in the academy system by publishing the accounts. The 2011 act contained a clause which ended this, by making the accounts secret due to the academies becoming &quot;exempt charities&quot;  exempt, that is, from publishing their accounts. The relevant body, the Charity Commission, has now removed from its records the accounts of all existing academies going back to 2005. Mr Gove appears aware that while education may be a minority interest, taxpayers may be concerned by the failure of their money to reach the children academy and free schools are supposed to be educating. For these and other reasons, critics of the academy and free schools policy are now calling for a royal commission on educational reform, to scrutinise the changes before they cause irreversible damage.Trevor FisherStafford Your story (Half of free schools opening this autumn have no premises, 13 April) didn&apos;t present a complete picture. The proportion of free school proposers which so far have confirmed sites is higher this year than it was at the same time last year. In September 2011, 24 free schools opened successfully in just over a year from the programme being opened up in June 2010. That compares with the three to five years it typically took to open new schools in the past. Of those 24, the great majority are already oversubscribed, some of them many times over. There is no reason to believe that this year the pattern will be very different. Yes, finding sites in some parts of London is difficult, but across the piece I am glad to say that we are continuing to support parents to open schools in record time  and at a lower average cost than under the Building Schools for the Future programme.Jonathan HillParliamentary undersecretary of state for schools, House of Lords",

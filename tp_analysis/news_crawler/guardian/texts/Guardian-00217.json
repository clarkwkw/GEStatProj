    "text": "Jenni Murrays recent suggestion ofanalysing pornography in the classroom might raise some eyebrows, but with up to 60% of young people using porn to teach themselves about sex, shes right that schools should not ignore it (Opinion, 17 October). The accessibility and lack of boundaries around pornography leave our children at risk of seeing confusing or upsetting images. Myths around dominance/submission, consent and sexual norms can skew ideas about relationships and gender, and unrealistic comparisons can damage body image. A school working with parents to promote healthy relationships and internet safety should certainly support its pupils to make sense of porn, offering practical help to encourage positive choices online and offline. Teaching about healthy relationships, consent and online safety begins in kindergarten, laying the foundations for the time when these topics become intertwined with pupils developing sexuality. As they mature, pupils benefit from a safe space in which to discuss broader questions. What pressures exist when consideringa sexual relationship? What activities are you more likely to meet in a porn film than in real life? What are the different views found in society relating to pornography? What messages might porn give us and how might our relationships be affected? Schools should be seeking to empower young people to navigate todays challenges. That includes understanding what porn is not: a manual for meaningful relationships.Sarah GriffithsHead of wellbeing, Dulwich College  Join the debate  email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",

    "text": "Meaningless statistics are everywhere these days. Whether it&apos;s self-selecting samples in surveys, or incomplete data just not showing you what you need to know, they&apos;re all over the place. They&apos;re the fructose syrup of news: they might make a story look fascinating, but in fact they&apos;re empty.  Here&apos;s the latest one. Carphone Warehouse says that the Galaxy S4 has generated more than four times as many pre-registrations as its predecessor, the Galaxy S3. To be precise, it says, 446%. Here&apos;s the money quote: &quot;in the first three days since announcement the S4 has received four times as many customers registering their interest than did during the SIII pre-reg phase.&quot; OK! There&apos;s a statistic. First of all, though - is it fourfold, or 446%? After all, 100% more is twice as much. Unless it&apos;s saying that the demand is 446% of the year-ago period. Here&apos;s the regulation quote. Graham Stapleton, the retailer&apos;s chief operating officer, said: &quot;The vast number of pre-registrations we&apos;ve had for this device is evidence how hot the Galaxy S4 is going to be. The launch event in New York clearly captured the imagination of many of our customers - acting as the driving force for the busiest pre-registration period we&apos;ve ever seen.&quot; Now, what does it actually mean, in terms of anything that matters? &quot;Pre-registration&quot; sounds good - except what is it? According to CPW, it&apos;s &quot;people expressing interest in being told more about the phone&apos;s pricing when that&apos;s available&quot;. Here&apos;s the pre-registration page.  It&apos;s emphatically not a &quot;pre-order&quot; - which is someone saying they want to buy the phone once it goes on sale. (Interestingly enough, CPW issued a press release last September saying that the iPhone 5 had the highest number of pre-orders it had ever seen for any phone ever in its history. It didn&apos;t say whether those translated into sales.) But hang on - why &quot;pre-registration&quot;? What&apos;s &quot;pre&quot; about it? Surely it&apos;s &quot;registration&quot; - people are registering their interest. And the page itself calls it &quot;registration&quot;, not &quot;pre-registration&quot;. The phone isn&apos;t yet on sale, and there isn&apos;t a tariff yet, but that&apos;s why people are registering their interest. They&apos;re not &quot;pre-registering&quot;. That would be the step before registering. They&apos;re  registering. In large numbers, it would seem. (Let&apos;s drop the &quot;pre-&quot; stuff. Pre-registrations are registrations, pre-orders are just orders made slightly early. They&apos;re orders all the same.)  How large, though, in actual numbers? And how does it compare to other brands and handsets, such as the HTC One, or the iPhone 5?  Also: how many registrations typically convert to orders? All of them? Half of them? 10%? Having a comparison of how many registrations turn into orders, and how many orders there were for the iPhone 5 and how many registrations there have been for the S4 would give a useful comparison of how the two phones are selling at their peak. Alas, that would count as useful information rather than a meaningless statistic. We did ask CPW. Answer came there none. So all we know is that interest - but not money down on the counter (orders aren&apos;t yet open yet for the S4) - is much higher than a year ago.  That definitely reflects Samsung&apos;s heightened presence in the smartphone market, which has grown dramatically in the past year. But as for useful comparisons of one device&apos;s potential sales with another? Not there. The smartphone business, and technology generally, abounds in these sort of not-quite-useful numbers; and you can tell how useless they are because when you ask for more detail, nothing happens. When you ask for comparative detail, you get none. It&apos;s just another meaningless statistic to ingest before realising that it&apos;s totally empty of actually useful information. And why write about it? So you know to watch out for empty stats like these, and to enquire further. There&apos;s little enough solid data out there. Let&apos;s not make it worse.",

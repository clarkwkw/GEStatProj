    "text": "It seemed risky after a summer of rain, wind and gloomy skies to return for an autumn break to a spot high up, a mile or so from Land&apos;s End, across bare and windswept Mayon Cliff. But there was sunshine every day and winds were modest. Happy surfers were riding the white crests down at Whitesand Bay, and the backdrop of the Minack theatre, whose rocky auditorium looks more spectacular each time you see it, was blue sky and smooth, sparkling water. Our way there was through gentle, wooded dells, close to Lamorna Cove, notable once for smuggling, but in modern times for its colony of artists. Next day, walking the steep lanes of Mousehole, and watching the busy scene at Newlyn harbour, we were more aware of some of the hard realities of Cornish life, the toil and danger of those who go to sea, and the history of shipwrecks, storms and Spanish raids. Those Mousehole and Newlyn scenes were familiar, but a mile east of Penzance, and a little way inland, looking down on Mount&apos;s Bay, we found somewhere entirely new to us, a sheltered, south-facing valley landscape of some 20 acres, thought once to have been a vineyard for the monks of St Michael&apos;s Mount. Called Tremenheere after the family that owned it for 600 years, it was bought in 1997 by Dr Neil Armstrong, whose vision is to make from its naturally generous features (warmth, shelter, opening vistas and wonderful soil) what its literature fairly describes as an arcadian space. Sculpture combines with the shape of the land and the skilful plantings to make the modern Tremenheere garden, and if you lift your eye at the right moment from streams, exotic foliage or stone feature, it is drawn through a gap in the screen of mature oak and beech to the bay and the sea and the sharp-edged silhouette of the mount itself.",

    "text": "You don&apos;t have to be blessed with the gift of prophecy to predict the UK headlines this time next week. Every year, GCSE and A-level results are greeted with claims of record attainment, falling standards and, that favourite tabloid phrase, &quot;dumbing down&quot;. Universities, meanwhile, agonise about how they can distinguish between large numbers of graduates with identical results, and report that even the highest grades don&apos;t necessarily mean a student is prepared for university study. Every education secretary is required to have something to say about all this, and Michael Gove duly jumped into the debate with a variety of proposals  notably, in a letter to Ofqual, that universities should have a direct influence over the content of A- levels. The idea was greeted with some caution by universities, understandably so  taking responsibility for A-levels is no small task. But it does constitute a major opportunity for universities, schools and students. University of the Arts London is one of a handful of UK universities that has its own awarding body. That means we award our own degrees, but we also do more than that. We design, assess and award a range of pre-19 qualifications delivered at more than 40 schools, colleges and universities. This is an incredibly powerful way for a university to influence pre-19 educational quality and to have a direct effect on what and how young people learn. It means we can develop qualifications that ensure students are thoroughly prepared to study arts and design at university because we know exactly what that study involves. Although we are a specialist institution, we share the common concerns of the sector about pre-19 education: that students come to us under-prepared for self-directed study and that they struggle to research and evaluate their own ideas  and ideas of others. But through qualifications such as our new Level 3 diplomas in art and design, we can tackle this head on by designing qualifications that are in tune with the art school ethos. That of learning through exploration, encouraging students to own their own academic development by trying things out, learning from mistakes and changing their minds. We design our qualifications in collaboration with colleges, universities and employers to ensure that we are addressing the education and employment needs of our sector. A second great advantage of university awarding bodies is that we can make assessment work much better for teachers, lecturers and students. At UAL, our partner schools, colleges and universities are subject to strong upfront quality assurance, which means that once they become part of the &apos;club&apos; we know we can trust them. Our assessment is tough but it is less frequent than that of traditional awarding bodies, and is conducted by expert staff who go and visit centres, reducing the assessment burden on teaching staff and freeing up their time for student contact. Third, and absolutely vital, is the issue of widening participation. I don&apos;t accept charges that universities aren&apos;t taking access seriously, and I agree that we cannot be held responsible for failures earlier on in the education system. But that doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t take an interest in that system and try to shape it. This year, for example, UAL Awarding Body is launching a broad one year arts and design programme for students with two to five GCSEs  the cohort at the greatest risk of becoming NEET (not in education, employment or training). This will get them to a level 3 qualification: A-level, BTEC or our own Level 3 diplomas. There is no reason why this couldn&apos;t be replicated for STEM or the humanities. All my experience tells me that university involvement in pre-19 education is a win-win venture. Designing an A-level? Bring it on.

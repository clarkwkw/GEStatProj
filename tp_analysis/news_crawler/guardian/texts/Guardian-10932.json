    "text": "   Screengrab of new comments Photograph: guardian.co.uk    We now have a new-look comment platform on our site, which has already been rolled out on the Guardian&apos;s environment, student, sport and culture pages. The main difference is that replies to a comment will be indented underneath the original comment. This should make it easier for users to scan the overall comment thread and focus on the parts of the discussion that are of interest, leaving space for others to join the wider discussion below. Another change is that you will have to hover over an individual comment to recommend, share or reply to it. The &quot;Guardian pick&quot; badge has changed from a grey box to an orange ribbon, and we have moved the comment box to the top of the thread to encourage people to respond directly to the article. The new comment thread has been developed through consultation with readers  we have run users&apos; panels and live tests on our site. There is more on the changes to the site in the FAQs, but we also invite you to leave your feedback in this thread. What do you think works? What needs improving? We look forward to hearing your thoughts. And please continue to join us to discuss some of the world&apos;s most important issues on comment threads, our Talk points, on Facebook and on Twitter.",

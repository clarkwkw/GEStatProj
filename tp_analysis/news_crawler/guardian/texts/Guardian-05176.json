But maybe you are wondering how your child can help the Royal Aociety choose the 2012 winners of their award. Well, wonder no more because the Royal Society is asking for your help!    The Royal Society, the UK&apos;s national academy of science, is inviting after-school reading groups and science clubs, youth book clubs and other interested youth groups to help them select the winner of the 2012 Royal Society Young People&apos;s Book Prize. This prize celebrates the best books that communicate science to young people up to age 14. These books are either factual or fictional stories intended to make science exciting to kids. An adult judging panel is selecting the shortlist of six finalists from recently published books that communicate science to young people. After this shortlist has been chosen, groups of young people will be invited to discuss the books and collectively select the winner. Participation is open to any youth group that is able to read, discuss the shortlist and recommend their choice for who should win. Selected youth groups will receive a complete set of the six shortlisted books to read and discuss before voting for their favourite book. Each group&apos;s votes will be sent to the Royal Society, who will tally them and announce the prize winner in late 2012. Seventy-five groups will be selected to receive a complete set of the shortlisted books for free; but if your group isn&apos;t selected to receive a set of books, you can still participate if you&apos;re able to buy the books yourself.  Applications must be received by Monday 30 April 2012. Learn more about the rules for participating in this prize. If you are a parent, teacher or other responsible adult, you can register your youth group to participate here. (Please note that participation is open to groups only and applications from individuals cannot be accepted.)  Previous prizewinners have included How the World Works by Christiane Dorion &amp; Beverley Young (2011), Can you feel the force? by Richard Hammond (2007) and Horrible Science: Really Rotten Experiments by Nick Arnold and Tony de Saulles (2004). You can view the complete list of prize winners here. The Royal Society Young People&apos;s Book Prize did not take place in 2008 - 2010 due to funding issues but restarted in 2011 thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientistevil google+: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

    "text": "The eastern side of Portland was sheltered, even on a windy day, with views of cliffs gently stretching away. The calm was in contrast to the buffeting we had received standing on the exposed Atlantic edge of the island, where the landscape fitted the customary descriptions of Portland as bleak and treeless. With its geology and centuries of quarrying Portland is, of course, where most buildings are made of the one material. We passed old houses made in the characteristic sturdy, low style with severe stone porches, proof against any weather. But as the ground sloped away on the sheltered side, there was a change; we came to a balmy, wooded area, with mown lawns and cedar trees, a little enclave with a character anything but bleak, and more like that of Torbay than of the coast we had just left. Here, some of the buildings, like the pastiche, castellated Pennsylvania Castle built between 1797 and 1800, had their own distinctive style and taste. The Portland museum is housed in two picture-postcard, 17th-century cottages attractively gabled and thatched, with a warm and welcoming look. One was adopted by Thomas Hardy as the home of Avice in his Portland novel, The Well-Beloved. A lane beside the museum leads to where steps go steeply down to Church Ope cove, a quiet inlet protected from the wind, said to have been used by smugglers but now a place of recreation; we looked down on bathing huts and small boats. Above the cove are the ruins of St Andrew&apos;s church scattered among the debris of successive landslips, but much higher again and close beside us, towering above the beach, was a rocky bluff on top of which stand the sheer walls of the ruined Rufus Castle. The original was said to have been built for William Rufus, the son of William the Conqueror. It peers out over the sea with a field of vision that no invader could have escaped.",

    "text": "Ambitions to eradicate world hunger will not be realised if aid for basic nutrition remains at only 0.4% of total official development assistance (ODA), according to the research group Development Initiatives (DI). Even though nutrition aid is rising, it remains far below what is needed, the DI report says. The World Bank estimated in 2010 that an increase of $10.3bn in annual resources would end undernutrition. But since these estimates, basic ODA for nutrition has increased by only $139m (90m), according to DI. The research group acknowledges, however, the difficulty in identifying aid for nutrition. Programmes in health, agriculture or education can have an important impact on nutrition, but the nutrition components are hard to identify and measure. For example, more than 3,300 aid projects reported to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2011, valued at $1.4bn in total, had nutrition components, but were not recorded as nutrition ODA. DI notes that at aggregate level, funding for nutrition is targeted at the 36 countries where 90% of stunted (low weight to height) children live. However, the distribution of aid among those countries does not reflect regional or national need. South Asia received 28% of all ODA for basic nutrition, although it represents 56% of the global gap in funds. India, which has most of the region&apos;s stunted children, receives comparably low levels of nutrition ODA. Projections suggest that the number of undernourished people will fall by only 82 million by 2050 if current commitments are met, leaving 766 million people undernourished. Combating hunger and malnutrition is the centrepiece of the If campaign, launched by a coalition of 100 UK NGOs and faith groups in January. Campaigners are lobbying David Cameron, the UK prime minister, to use Britain&apos;s presidency of the G8 this year to push hard on ending hunger. The British government and the Children&apos;s Investment Fund Foundation will co-host a high-level meeting, Nutrition for Growth: Beating Hunger through Business and Science, in London on 8 June, coinciding with an event in Hyde Park organised by the If coalition. The meeting will bring together business leaders, scientists, government representatives and civil society groups to make commitments to tackle undernutrition in some of the poorest countries. A separate report from the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) thinktank stressed the importance of smallholder agriculture in improving food security and reducing undernutrition. The report said empowering female farmers through legislation on rights and education, promoting home gardens and small-scale livestock rearing, and complementary programmes in health, water and sanitation would improve the lives of smallholder farmers. Steve Wiggins, co-author of the report, emphasised the importance of the public sector. &quot;We need a reasonably effective state pointing in the right direction,&quot; he said. &quot;We are not going to remedy this with nicer businesses. Nestl can do things with dairy supplies  that is part of the picture  but businesses are not going to put in the water [infrastructure] and educate girls. Businesses can help at the margins, but it needs public sector responsibilities.&quot; Wiggins pointed to the success of the Shouhardo programme in Bangladesh, run by the NGO Care between 2006 and 2010, funded by the US government&apos;s Food for Peace programme. Shouhardo covered 400,000 households in the most marginal areas of the country, the seasonally flooded Haor lands, the Charlands (sand and silt islands) of the big rivers and the coast  all highly vulnerable to river flooding, cyclones or both. In four years, the programme reduced stunting among children aged between six and 24 months by 16 percentage points despite hardly any improvement nationally. Female empowerment was the strongest single determinant of success, according to ODI, but it was the programme&apos;s combination with mother and child healthcare, sanitation, agriculture and fisheries that made it so effective. Shouhardo&apos;s success suggests that significant progress can be made on underlying factors such as female empowerment, ODI said. By contrast, the influential Scaling Up Nutrition framework focuses on highly targeted interventions such as micro-nutrient supplements and therapeutic feeding, on the grounds that tackling the fundamental problems of poverty, access to food, health and sanitation would take too long.",

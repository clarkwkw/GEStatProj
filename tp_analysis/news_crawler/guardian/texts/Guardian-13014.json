    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Crysis 3 puts you back in the alien-DNA-enhanced nanosuit of the Prophet, a man beset by strange visions as well as a tasty suite of abilities including night vision, brief invisibility or invincibility and the capacity to hack enemy hardware. You&apos;ll need all these skills in the fight against the mega-corporation Cell and its gun-toting lackeys, and the squid-like alien Ceph. New York 2.0, a decaying city under an impervious dome, is utterly gorgeous  a real rather than metaphorical urban jungle  with broken skyscrapers merging with steamy rainforest. The characters too not only have stunningly realistic facial animation, but are well acted, believable people. Working through the game&apos;s exquisitely designed spaces against seamless enemy AI is never less than utterly absorbing.",

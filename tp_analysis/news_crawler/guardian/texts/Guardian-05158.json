    "text": "Direct electrical stimulation of a specific part of the brain can enhance spatial memory in conscious neurosurgical patients, according to a small new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The research suggests that an experimental technique called deep brain stimulation could help patients with memory impairments, such as those with Alzheimer&apos;s disease.  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical technique involving the implantation of thin wire electrodes into the brain. In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the technique as a treatment for Parkinson&apos;s Disease, and more recently, a number of clinical trials have shown that it effectively alleviates symptoms of bipolar depression, too. Nanthia Suthana of the Cognitive Neurophysiology Laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles, and her colleagues performed the study in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who were being evaluated prior to having the seizure-causing brain tissue surgically removed. During such evaluations, the patient remains conscious and can report back to the surgeons, who can therefore electrically stimulate the brain to identify and delimit the abnormal tissue, while also identifying nearby tissue that performs important functions and must be spared.  Seven such patients had the DBS electrodes implanted for between 7 and 10 days, in the hippocampus or the adjacent entorhinal cortex, which connects to the hippocampus via the perforant path, or both. These structures are located on the inner surface of the temporal lobe and are involved in spatial memory and navigation.  During these long pre-surgical evaluation periods, Suthana and her colleagues asked them to play a video game involving a spatial learning task in which they had to drive a taxi through a virtual environment, learn various landmarks within it, then find their way around it again afterwards to drop passengers off at one of six locations.  Each patient repeated this four times, navigating to all six locations in a random order each time. The electrodes were switched on at certain times while they navigated to specified locations, and this was done consistently during the first three trials. In this way, some of the patients received stimulation of the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex only while navigating to locations 1, 3 and 5, while others received it only while navigating to locations 2, 4 and 6. During the fourth trial, no stimulation was applied, and the researchers tested the patients&apos; memory for all six locations by measuring the length of the path they took to get there. DBS applied to the entorhinal cortex significantly enhanced the patients&apos; spatial memories when compared to stimulation of the hippocampus or none at all. Six of them took shorter and faster paths to the locations they had learned during stimulation to the entorhinal cortex, recognizing the landmarks more readily, and even finding shortcuts, to navigate the required routes more quickly.  Since this effect occurs during the learning phase, it seems that electrical stimulation of the entorhinal region facilitates encoding of the spatial memories, and the researchers suggest that it does so by resetting low frequency theta oscillations, which optimizes memory formation by synchronizing electrical activity of the cells needed. But it&apos;s not clear if electrical stimulation would have the same effects on other types of memory. Previous studies have shown that direct stimulation of the human hippocampus has detrimental effects on memory, but these new results identify the entorhinal cortex, and possibly the perforant path, as potential targets for memory enhancement. It was a small study so the findings should be interpreted with caution, but they could have clinical applications if confirmed.  The inner surface of the temporal lobe is the first part of the brain to degenerate in Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and this is accompanied by an inability to find one&apos;s way around, which is the first behavioural manifestation. The new study suggests that deep brain stimulation targeted to the entorhinal cortex or perforant path could ameliorate these memory deficits, but this, too, will need to be tested.

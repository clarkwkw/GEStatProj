London Games FestivalWhen: 27 Sept - 28 OctWhere: various venues, LondonWhat: There&apos;s still time to enjoy this month-long celebration of gaming, taking place throughout the capital.

GameCity 7When: 20-27 OctoberWhere: various venues, Nottingham city centreWhat: The annual games event that I will go ahead and call &apos;utterly unmissable to anyone who has even glanced with ardour at a video game&apos; is now a week-long odyssey, taking in the usual selection of inspiring talks, indie game expos and amusing evening shenanigans. Gamesblog will there too, albeit in a reduced capacity, hosting one of seven different mornings at the Broadway Cinema cafe. I&apos;ll also be taking part in the Friday evening event, &apos;Reads like a seven&apos;, which also features fellow Guardian writers Christian Donlan and Simon Parkin!

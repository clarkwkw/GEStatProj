    "text": "I have lived in or near the same small village for over 65 years. I have watched jackdaw numbers grow from eight or nine pairs around the village to mobs of well over a hundred birds (&apos;Alarming&apos; loss of garden birds, 28 March). The reason is that they are no longer being shot by farmers and landowners, who saw them, with most of the crow family, as pests. These birds are prolific nest robbers, taking both eggs and chicks. On many occasions I have watched helplessly as all sorts of birds, from thrushes through to finches nesting in our garden have had their eggs and young taken. This is often done in the early morning by as many as half a dozen jackdaws raiding together. We used to have a dozen or more nests around our garden. We now watch as the odd wood pigeon, dove or blackbird tries to nest and hatch their eggs, but always with the same result.Rowland KnightWalgrave, Northamptonshire ",

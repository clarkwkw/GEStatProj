    "text": "Among the myriad ways in which social media are touching our lives are changes in the relationship between scientists and citizens, in both directions. My recent New to Nature about a wasp named after Lady Gaga resulted in tens of thousands of website hits within 24 hours. And now a citizen scientist&apos;s photograph of a beautiful green lacewing posted to a photo-sharing website has resulted in the description of a new species. Evidence of the new status of Semachrysa jade are fairly technical and primarily of interest to devotees of lacewings including details of wing venation, coloration of the head and wings, and a tuft of setae and shape of abdominal sternite seven. It is noteworthy, although not yet biologically significant, that S jade most closely resembles Semachrysa wallacei and that both are known only from females. It is interesting, too, that the specific epithet jade refers both to the lovely green colour of the insect and the name of the daughter of Dr Shaun Winterton, senior author on the paper documenting the species. Aside from the undeniable beauty of the new species, its path of discovery through a social media site makes for a fascinating and cautionary tale. Hock Ping Guek is a professional photographer and citizen scientist who lives in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and whose online nom de plume is Kurt Orionmystery. He photographed a particularly attractive green lacewing in Selangor, releasing the specimen and posting images on Flickr for comments from photographers and natural historians. When the photographs were seen by Dr Winterton of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, he realised that the lacewing was significant and did not obviously belong to any of the known species of Malaysia. While this was good luck, it was not entirely random. Because of intelligent software that &quot;knew&quot; that Dr Winterton had previously viewed photographs of insects, recent images automatically served up to him included the lacewing. Dr Winterton forwarded the images to several colleagues who all agreed that it was most likely a new species, but there was a problem. The images did not show all of the morphological characters needed to determine unambiguously what genus the species belonged to, and without firm generic placement, confirmation and description as a new species would be impossible. Guek returned to the same locality and successfully rediscovered, photographed, and collected another female specimen. The species was subsequently described by Winterton, Guek and Mr Steve Brooks of the Natural History Museum, London. Dr. Brooks agreed that the species was new and extended its known range by recognising a specimen collected in Sabah and deposited in the NHM as conspecific. The recognition of the species was followed up by a series of new media implementations. The international collaborators wrote the paper on a shared document site, images were archived in Morphbank and the Encyclopedia of Life, both open-access online taxonomic resources, the species was described in the electronic journal ZooTaxa, and the new species was registered in ZooBank, an online registry for taxonomic and nomenclatural decisions impacting the scientific names of animals. And now the new species has created quite a buzz in other social media and its technical description is thethird most accessed article in the online journal. With extremely rare exceptions, it is important that one or more physical specimens be collected and deposited in a natural history museum for new species and that one specimen be designated type. This ensures access to as many anatomical details as possible and, in the long term, makes the use of the new scientific name objective. As new species and evidence are gathered in the future, and understanding of species changes and advances, experts are able to consult the type specimen to assure that it, and the name attached to it, are being appropriately applied to the best theories of species.",

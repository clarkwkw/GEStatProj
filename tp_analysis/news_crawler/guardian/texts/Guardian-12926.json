    "text": "The 4G auction took five years to organise and involved 50 rounds of bidding by seven competitors, in a process so complex its result was determined by computers and mathematical algorithms. But what was it all for? Our passion for smartphones  more than half the population has such an internet-capable device  means the 3G airwaves currently used to transmit mobile internet signals are rapidly getting crowded. &quot;If more than about 30 people show up in any one place and try to get online with their phone, it all grinds to a halt,&quot; said one industry observer. With the addition of 4G, that should change. New spectrum  equivalent to two-thirds of the radio frequencies currently used for mobile  has been put under the hammer. Much of it was freed up by switching the nation&apos;s television sets from analogue to digital. The UK is not unique: digital switch-over has been used to boost mobile services across the world in an internationally co-ordinated changeover. Fourth generation mobile wireless will change the way we use our phones. The speed and capacity of networks will improve, with connections as fast as the average home broadband service being promised. But better services are not a given. They will require new equipment and more spending by mobile companies. Telecoms regulator Ofcom has said it will keep them on their toes by publishing who is deploying services in which areas and at what speeds. If they invest in the right number of masts and radios, networks now have the bandwidth to ensure they do not collapse under the strain of servicing commuters in railway stations at rush hour, car passengers on motorways in traffic jams or festivalgoers unwise enough to use their smartphones in the mud.",

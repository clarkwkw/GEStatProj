    "text": "One of the finest games of the PS2 era receives a phenomenal upgrade for Sony&apos;s powerhouse portable, boasting extra characters, enhanced visuals and a virtual museum of background content. Eschewing typical role-playing game fantasy trappings, Persona 4 Golden takes place in the modern-day fictional Japanese town of Inaba, which is plagued by bizarre murders. Recently transplanted to the locale, you&apos;ll uncover the truth by battling through a parallel world beyond TV screens, one populated by Jungian psychological archetypes given form. It&apos;s a deep and pleasantly weird experience. While the story is captivating, gameplay hasn&apos;t aged quite as well. The turn-based battle system is better than many of its kind but still slow, and the lengthy set-up means you won&apos;t get to the meat of the game for a good three to four hours. Those with patience, however, will enjoy its complex narrative.",

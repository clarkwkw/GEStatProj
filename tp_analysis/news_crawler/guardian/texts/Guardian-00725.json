    "text": "Update: 16 January Just wanted to update this blog with new data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), as promised. I asked HESA which undergraduate degree subjects awarded the most  and least  firsts in 2006-07 and 2010-11. Interestingly, mathematical sciences awarded the most firsts in 2006-07 and 2010-11. In 2006-07, 28.9% of those taking the subject gained a first. In 2010-11, 30% of those taking the subject were awarded a first. Students of law are least likely to gain a first, it seems. In 2006-07, 5.8% did. In 2010-11, 8.1% did.",

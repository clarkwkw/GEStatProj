    "text": "So I have a new paper out and it&apos;s one I&apos;m rather excited about. This of course means I have the ambivalence that comes with all such things: the frisson of excitement about the discovery and having this out in the open after a lot of hard work, but tempered by the fear that it will be rapidly shredded or ignored by the scientific community. Anyway, this is a project I had in mind for a while but didn&apos;t really know how to tackle the problem. Discussions with a friend who specialises in the ecology of body size, Eoin O&apos;Gorman, led to us working out how we could get to grips with the issues of dinosaur body sizes and we got cracking. We started on the project while we were both based in Dublin and happily we have both ended up Queen Mary University of London which has helped us get this finished off and out into the world. Longtime readers will be familiar with the issues of body sizes in non-avian dinosaurs and the fact that some of these animals were truly colossal. However, what is often little mentioned or discussed is a different aspect on this  the distribution of body sizes for dinosaur species. Sure, there are lots of giant species out there (and these tend to be familiar to the public), but is this really normal? Did dinosaurs have lots of large species and few small ones? There are plenty of small, even tiny, dinosaurs out there after all. If we look at living mammals say, there are tons of rodent species (small) but pretty few antelope (big), and very few elephants (huge). A similar pattern is true of birds (not many vultures and albatross, a lot of finches and thrushes) and indeed of reptiles, fish and amphibians. In fact, looking at living vertebrates this overall pattern is relatively uniform and this was the first thing we tackled  collecting data on various groups to show that this pattern was largely normal. And so to the dinosaurs. A couple of papers have looked at body size distribution before, but not in great detail. We tried to get every species for which a reasonable estimate of size could be made and tracked down various data points from papers, measured things from skeletons and gratefully took data that was kindly offered by colleagues. Putting this together gave us a pretty good cross-section of dinosaur diversity and allowed us to get a picture of their distribution. It was, essentially, a mirror image of what we see for the living groups  a great many large species and pretty few small species. Dinosaurs it seemed were fundamentally different in their distribution to other groups that we know of. More than this, this overall pattern is pretty much uniform no matter how we split the data by time or place, thought notably one group (the theropods, which include all the carnivorous dinosaurs and are the ancestors of birds) does have a different distribution with more smaller species and fewer large forms than the other dinosaur clades. Inevitably things are a little more complex than this. Most importantly there are various biases in the fossil record  what we find and can study is not necessarily a fair reflection of what there once was. We don&apos;t get much soft tissue for example, and pertinently smaller individuals are rarer and harder to find. So could it be that our results are just biased because we&apos;ve missed out all the small species? Well we think not, and for several reasons. First off, our results are so completely different from what we&apos;d expect we&apos;d have to be missing thousands of extra small species to get out current dataset to have a mammal-like distribution. Secondly, we looked at a dataset for fossil mammals, and while this did indeed suffer a bit from missing small species, it didn&apos;t change the picture too dramatically  in short the mammal data was not badly affected by this bias. We also looked at pterosaurs  close relatives of the dinosaurs, and living alongside them in the same times and places. While there is little data available for pterosaurs, they do have a distribution different to the dinosaurs and the same as other vertebrates, again suggesting that the bias is not affecting things. Finally, the theropods are different to the other dinosaurs and do have a more normal (if different) pattern  if these biases were affecting dinosaurs to this degree, why is there a difference here in one group and not the others? So, assuming that our results are correct, how is it that dinosaurs as a dominant terrestrial clade have a different distribution to mammals say. (Note that how did they get so big is a different, if related question). Why all the big dinosaurs? Or perhaps rather, where are the small species? In this case we may not have far to look  a hypothesis has been doing the rounds about dinosaur ecology for a while, and was relatively recently formalised and it fits our data really rather nicely. In essence, dinosaurs have a big gap in size between the point at which they become independent of their parents, and the time they reach full adult size. While there is good evidence for parental care in dinosaurs, this seems to be primarily for animals that are relatively young. Parents guard nests and brood their eggs, and perhaps brought food to the babies and looked after them for a while, but many would go off on their own at a young age and small size. While dinosaurs did have very rapid growth, they had a long way to go. Mammals are born at a pretty fair size compared to their mother, and birds eggs are similarly large compared to the mum, but dinosaur eggs were mostly pretty small compared to the size of the adult. There&apos;s a limit to how big an egg can be, so once dinosaurs start getting really big, the egg size can&apos;t keep up and the discrepancy between hatchling and momma gets greater and greater.  This means that the small independent juveniles were occupying rather different ecological niches to the adults. Even a half-grown Diplodocus that could have been over a ton and eight or nine meters long would not be feeding on the same plants in the same way as an adult that was closer to thirty meters long and could reach far higher into the trees. A baby Tyrannosaurus of some 250 kilos would be a hefty animal, but clearly not taking the same kind of prey as a ten ton adult. In other words, when we look back at our data and wonder where the small species are, the answer could well be that the ecological niches are there, but they are filled by the juveniles of larger dinosaurs. There&apos;s scope for a 250 kilo predator, but that job is, as it were, taken by baby rexes rather than a separate, smaller species. While this might sound odd or unlikely, it&apos;s actually close to what we see in modern crocodiles. The mother guards the eggs and the hatchlings but after a few months or a year or so, they go off on their own even though they won&apos;t be breeding adults for another few years. Tiny ones eat insects and things like tadpoles before graduating from tiny, to ever larger, fish and eventually getting big enough to start tackling large mammals. Contrast that with the vast majority of birds or mammals where the babies start quite large compared to the parents and are nurtured with huge amounts of food until they are close to adult size and finding food for themselves. Dinosaurs followed this crocodilian plan but writ large. This of course may have major implications for how we picture dinosaurian ecosystems. They might have all the wonderful complexity of modern ecosystems with numerous interlocking ecological niches and a wide variety of different forms, but actually being filled by relatively few species. It&apos;s trite to say dinosaurs were different to birds or mammals, but it&apos;s understandable that these have formed the mainstay of how we have pictured how a dinosaur ecosystem might have been structured. Various lines of evidence are starting to come together to suggest that it might be time to think again. O&apos;Gorman, E. &amp; Hone, D.W.E. 2012. Body size distribution of the dinosaurs.

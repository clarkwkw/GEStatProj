    "text": "The Guardian (27 April) and the Observer (28 April) have recently given coverage to my alleged views about Eton and public service. In both I was quoted out of context. I was not denigrating any school, state or private. Indeed, I have spent large parts of my life working in or around education. This includes running an NGO giving away new medical textbooks in Eastern Europe, during and after the Communist period; serving as board member of an inner-city comprehensive school; helping to set up an early online learning provider; and supporting education and training programmes for young people today, through various local and national organisations. I also taught philosophy for six years at University College London. In my constituency I vigorously promote and support local schools. Indeed, two years ago I set up my own pilot programme for KS2 children in Herefordshire who struggle with maths. Much of this is a matter of public record on www.jessenorman.com and www.jesse4hereford.com.Jesse Norman MPCon, Hereford and South Herefordshire",

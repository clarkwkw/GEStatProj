    "text": "Description A bee-like hoverfly, with a wingspan around 28mm. Ecology Hoverflies don&apos;t have stings, instead relying on their resemblance to bees and wasps for defence. This hoverfly takes the deception a stage further and looks exactly like a bumblebee  it even flies like a bumblebee. They are extremely hard to spot, but can sometimes be seen visiting hawthorn flowers and around rot holes high in trees. Their eggs are laid in these holes and it&apos;s thought the larvae take a number of years to develop. Distribution Found in southern England and the midlands, with fewer records in the north, Scotland or Wales.

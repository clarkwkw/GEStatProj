    "text": "Waitrose is to source all its seafood from independently certified sources by the end of 2016, it said on Thursday. The supermarket, which sells 12% of the UK&apos;s fish, hopes to build on its responsible fish sourcing policy that was launched 15 years ago. The retailer said the move will also help it ensure a longer-term guarantee of sustainability in the face of increasing global pressure on fish stocks. Waitrose fish buyer Jeremy Langley said: &quot;With global demand for fish increasing, and the size of our business increasing - we need to ensure we&apos;re putting the right steps in place now if we&apos;re to ensure a sustainable supply of fish in the decades to come.&quot; The first major change will be all Waitrose fresh, smoked and breaded cod and haddock, which from 6 May will be certified as sustainable by the MSC, which uses a blue tick logo. The 100% goal will affect all seafood, fresh, tinned and frozen fish, and all fish in Waitrose foods, from ready meals to sandwiches. The company&apos;s existing fish policy covers four areas. For wild fish: full traceability from catch to consumer; caught from a well-managed fishery; caught using responsible fishing methods; and not a species regarded as under threat or endangered. For farmed fish: only sourcing fish from known and approved farms; rearing fish to the highest animal welfare; using responsible feeds and feeding regime; farming with care for the environment. Waitrose also said on Thursday it would continue to cut energy use and reduce packaging. By 2016, for example, it is aiming to halve its packaging compared to 2005 and increase the amount that shoppers can recycle themselves.",

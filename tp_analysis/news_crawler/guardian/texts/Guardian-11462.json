    "text": "It&apos;s tempting to measure Assassin&apos;s Creed III on the Wii U against the earlier release on competing formats. Tempting, but almost pointless, as the game itself is largely unchanged. It is still the tale of trainee assassin Desmond and his memories of half-Mohawk ancestor Connor, set in the earliest days of America&apos;s founding. The scale, the expansive environments, the exploratory freedom  none of this is diminished. The what of the game is the same; it&apos;s the how that&apos;s different, and that&apos;s down to the Wii U GamePad. Even so, the changes are minor  the map screen is now displayed in larger scale on the controller&apos;s screen, giving a much-appreciated greater awareness of location and targets, though details must still be found by clambering to vantage points to scout areas. You can also swap Connor&apos;s weapons and equipment with a mere touch now. That is, essentially, it. These two tweaks allow for smoother navigation and combat, but not enough to drastically alter the gameplay experience. A remarkable game and worthy purchase for anyone who hasn&apos;t played yet, though nothing 360 or PS3 owners will want to jump ship for.",

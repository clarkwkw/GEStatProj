    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view If you&apos;ve played the other Army Of Two games you probably won&apos;t be expecting poignant subtextual discourse on the futility of war; more a pair of heavily armed fist-bumping frat boys on a killing spree. The cringe-inducing dialogue never even pauses, punctuating the mass murder with crass banality as you rack up dollars for decimating the locals. In each of the game&apos;s short sections, the fragility of cover and scenery is a surprise highlight, as cars explode, heavy things topple on to foes and masonry splinters, especially in overkill mode, which grants temporary invincibility, infinite ammo and a short-term upgrade in firepower. There&apos;s little else to recommend it, though. Ankle-height obstacles prove insurmountable, and co-op mode  the game&apos;s very raison d&apos;tre  is hobbled by the constant flood of enemies and its insistence on taking you back to the beginning of levels when a human joins your game, removing any possibility of teamwork. Lacklustre, coarse and disappointingly insubstantial.",

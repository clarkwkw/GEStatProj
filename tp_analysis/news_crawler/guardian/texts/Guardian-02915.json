    "text": "Teachers are set to strike over government plans to force a Tottenham primary school to become an academy, the National Union of Teachers has announced as it prepares to decide whether to stage co-ordinated industrial action across schools over its opposition to the government&apos;s academy programme. The NUT announced it would ballot members at Downhills primary school in Haringey, north London, over potential changes to staff pay and conditions if the school does become an academy. Michael Gove, the education secretary, has faced criticism over his decision to push through the school&apos;s conversion to academy status despite widespread opposition from the local community. The NUT is opposed to academies and free schools, which have greater freedom to change the timings of the school day, teachers&apos; pay and the subjects they teach, and are accountable to the education secretary rather than their local authority. Figures released by the Department for Education last week revealed that the majority of England&apos;s state secondary schools were, or were about to become, academies, but primary schools are far more reluctant to adopt academy status. Just 5% of primaries are, or are about to become, academies. The union will draw up a ballot for over the coming days to enable rolling industrial action, including strikes, to take place over the summer. The teachers&apos; union announced its decision to ballot following a consultation with teachers at the affected school, as it prepares to debate a motion at its annual conference in Torquay which calls for a &quot;maximum co-ordination of strike action across schools against imposed academisation up to and including national strike action&quot; to defeat &quot;forced academisation&quot; of smaller schools. A separate motion will debate taking industrial action in schools that set pay and conditions that deviate from the national pay rates, pointing out that academies that have already chosen to do so usually offer inferior pay and conditions. Academies also get a mention in a priority motion on threats to teachers&apos; pay and conditions as a result of various policy moves. The motion, being debated on Monday, calls on the union to take &quot;all appropriate action&quot; including balloting members for strike action, if Gove puts forwards &quot;specific proposals to attack teachers&apos; national pay and conditions&quot; under government plans to introduce local pay. The flurry of heavyweight motions come on the back of a resolution agreed over the weekend to continue joint strike action from this summer over pensions. Kevin Courtney, the NUT deputy general secretary, said the Downhills ballot centred on the possible changes to teachers&apos; pay and conditions if the conversion were to go ahead. &quot;Where academy conversions are threatened we do, from time to time, agree to ballot our members for a trade dispute against the change in employer because of the threat to pay and conditions that&apos;s implied by the change in employer. It is not a ballot for strike action against the government&apos;s policy of forced academies. It&apos;s about a ballot for strike action about the change of employer that the forced academies leads to.&quot; He added: &quot;Politically we&apos;re completely opposed to forced academies. We&apos;re supporting the parents&apos; campaign at Downhills. This is a trade dispute around a different and narrower question about the transfer of employment.&quot; Courtney said that industrial action had achieved success in other schools undergoing conversion, from persuading a school to rethink to securing guarantees on pay and conditions. He stressed that teachers would be careful to ensure the industrial action was not timed to coincide with the Sat exam period and dates for action were still being drawn up. Courtney said: &quot;The parents at the school are involved in a serious campaign that they have initiated themselves and they are very serious about it. We will want to talk to them. We won&apos;t want our strike action to alienate the parents at the school.&quot; Janet Lallysmith, one of the parents involved in the Save Downhills campaign, backed the move. &quot;The parents are supportive of the teachers being balloted for industrial action. It is not something teachers do lightly, but it is one of the means of negotiations they have.&quot; Downhills was judged inadequate in its latest inspection by the watchdog Ofsted in February and will now become an academy, but the school has claimed Gove is illegally attempting to force academy status on it and that attainment records and an interim Ofsted report last September suggest standards were improving. One of the last acts of the school&apos;s governing body before being replaced with an interim executive body was to conduct a parental ballot to gauge views about turning the school into an academy, which showed more than 90% were against the move. A Department for Education spokesperson said: &quot;Downhills primary school has been underperforming for several years. Most recently Ofsted found that the school is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and that those responsible for leading, managing and governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement. That is why we have appointed an interim executive board to give the school the leadership and expertise it needs to improve. This board will consult on whether academy conversion should take place.&quot; One parent of a pupil at the school has started a judicial review against the DfE.",

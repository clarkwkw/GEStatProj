    "text": "Eve Hobsbawm is a London-based life counsellor. Make contact through her website  EveProblemSolver.com  and for a small fee she will send you helpful advice. Two weeks ago, I got in touch: I had lost my keys, and was panicking about what to cook my friends. But I also couldn&apos;t work out how Eve manages to run a business while attending school  since she is just eight years old. &quot;What inspired me was my daddy,&quot; says Eve of Andy, who runs a tech start-up. &quot;As soon as I saw his business and understood the kinds of things businesses do, I thought that&apos;s what I&apos;m going to do.&quot; At first she wasn&apos;t sure what kind of company she wanted. &quot;Then it just popped into my head: problem solving.&quot; It all started in December, when Eve was seven. &quot;The first person I exchanged business cards with said her husband was really annoying. So I said: &apos;It all cancels out. You might do stuff to him that&apos;s also really annoying.&apos; She was really impressed.&quot; Eve has consulted on roughly 40 dilemmas, with payments ranging from 10p to 5. She hopes in time to build the problem-solving equivalent of a walk-in doctor&apos;s surgery. Is she any good? I&apos;d say so. Eve suggested my keys were in the hall  and they were  and recommended spaghetti as a quick and easy meal, which it was. All for 2.",

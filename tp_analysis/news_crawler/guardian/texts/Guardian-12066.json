    "text": "There&apos;s something physicists haven&apos;t told you  until now. This week on Science Weekly we have an extract of Sean Carroll&apos;s lecture at the Royal Institution entitled The Particle at the End of the Universe in which he reveals that secret. Sean is a theoretical physicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California.  You can watch the whole lecture on YouTube, the Q&amp;A session afterwards, and an interview he gave about what happens next at the Large Hadron Collider. Also this week, Alok Jha meets astronomy blogger Stuart Clark to discuss last week&apos;s announcement of a Nasa/European Space Agency Orion collaboration: a programme of missions beyond low Earth orbit.  Plus, Ryan O&apos;Hare talks to Professor Bob Elwood about his research investigating whether crabs can experience pain. Subscribe for free via iTunes to ensure every episode gets delivered.

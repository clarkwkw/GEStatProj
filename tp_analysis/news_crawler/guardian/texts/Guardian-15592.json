    "text": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Glass Questions &gt;&gt; ongoing Tim Bray on Google Glass:   Do They Meet a Need?  Seems pretty obvious to me; I&apos;m damn sick of hauling out my mobile to find out what time it is, or to check on my next meeting, or to glance at a map, or to snap a quick photo of an interesting streetlight or whatever. Will They Succeed?  I haven&apos;t got the vaguest. They need work on power consumption and software fit/finish and syncing and lots of other things, and the manufacturing cost needs to come way, way down. A lot of the things Glass does could maybe work just fine on a smart watch or some such. So in a couple years it might be ubiquitous, maybe it&apos;ll just catch on for certain professional uses, or maybe it just falls flat. But people, and there are a lot of them, who are saying &quot;Glass is doomed because it&apos;s dorky-looking/privacy-invasive/anti-social&quot; are pretty well wrong; it&apos;s more complex than that.  Yup. Microsoft caught lying about tablet size in comparison to Apple&apos;s iPad &gt;&gt; AppleInside Can&apos;t we all just get along? (Thanks @slimbowski for the link.) Bitcoin hits the big time, to the regret of some early boosters &gt;&gt; MIT Technology Review  Bitpay recently received $3m from Founders Fund, led by Facebook&apos;s first major investor, Peter Thiel. BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi told me that Thiel invested because he saw how the company could help ease online commerce across borders; the company already handles $5m in transactions each month and says the figure is growing. &quot;Traditional payments such as credit cards don&apos;t even work in half the world, so companies just choose to not service international customers,&quot; Gallippi said. &quot;That leaves a big opportunity.&quot; He plans to take further investment later this year but told me it will be more for reasons of making strategic contacts than a need for cash, since he and his cofounders have significant Bitcoin holdings. One reason Bitcoin is interesting, says Jeremy Liew, a partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, is that it could displace the practice of wiring money across borders, which underpins much international trade today and can be onerous. &quot;If I&apos;m trying to wire a supplier in China it&apos;s a three- or four-day process with heavy fees,&quot; he says. &quot;Bitcoin transactions can be instant and free.&quot;  Bitcoin will work in places where credit cards won&apos;t, seems to be the suggestion. Superfast broadband for Staffordshire after BT wins 27.4m deal &gt;&gt; V3.co.uk  BT has won yet another superfast broadband deal, this time in Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent, in which the vast majority of the region will be hooked to speeds of at least 24Mbps. The 27.35m deal will see 472,000 premises  around 97% of the region  receive the high-speed service. The councils involved are investing 7.44m, while 7.44m will come from the Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) framework and 12.47m from BT.  A Staffordshire county council member described the fibre infrastructure as being &quot;as important as road or rail in providing the accessibility and opportunities for our residents and businesses.&quot; And this apparently means we&apos;re just past the halfway stage in the national fibre broadband rolling. Samsung GALAXY S4 hits 10 million milestone in first month &gt;&gt; SAMSUNG TOMORROW Global  Samsung Electronics announced that global channel sales of its GALAXY S4, a life companion for a richer, fuller, simpler life, has surpassed 10 million units sold in less than one month after its commercial debut. Launched globally on April 27 in 60 countries, the phone is estimated to be selling at a rate of four units per second.  Android&apos;s market share is literally a joke &gt;&gt;Tech.pinions John Kirk:   Android accounts for approximately 70% of global smartphone shipments and 29% of global profits. This means that the average Android manufacturer creates just 0.41% of profit for each point of market share (0.29/0.70 = 0.414). In other words, the average Android manufacturer needs to capture 2.4 points of market share just to increase their [share of] market profit by 1 percentage point. Such a low fair share profit index may indicate that Android manufacturers are: Having difficulty differentiating their product; Sacrificing profits in order to buy market share (the &quot;race to the bottom&quot;);  Unable to reach economies of scale in the manufacturing process.  Kirk&apos;s point is that people who talk about low-cost iPhones are overlooking price elasticity. Although might he be overlooking the fact that the sector of the market which is price inelastic has been almost exhausted? How Google plans to rule the computing world through Chrome &gt;&gt; Tech News and Analysis Kevin Tofel:   if you&apos;re a Chrome user today, you&apos;ll be more immersed in the Chrome ecosystem a year from now, even if you don&apos;t have an &quot;official&quot; Chromebook. This all depends on how well Google pulls off its strategy to upend the desktop computing world, but so far, it seems to be on track. Bear in mind the apps in this vision will be truly cross-platform as they&apos;ll run on any Windows, Mac or Linux computer with Chrome installed.If it can get developers on board  and those I spoke with at Google I/O are ready to embrace the effort  Google will have a thriving desktop platform built on top of the platforms created by others. But it will be a desktop that&apos;s far more agile, with new features added within days or weeks, not months or years. Welcome to Chrome, my desktop today and your desktop of the future.  It depends more on how much people want web apps that might or might not run offline, and might or might not have a better UI than a native app, on their desktop. Other than that, solid. At the Mayo Clinic, iPhones and iPads are the standard &gt;&gt; CITEworld  Troy Newman, an IT specialist who oversees app development for Mayo, adds that the clinic was accustomed to running on a single platform - Windows - and wanted its mobile initiative to be similarly standardized. &quot;All our developers know how to do Windows development, so we made the same kind of same decision for iOS. We wanted a platform where we could get developers up to speed and train them to develop apps.&quot; Finding that expertise hasn&apos;t always been easy. &quot;Our team&apos;s pretty small,&quot; says Newman. &quot;As we&apos;ve grown, it has been difficult to find people with the right skills who want to work in Rochester, Minnesota.&quot;  15,000 devices using those apps. Meanwhile, the 25,000 PCs that it also uses might be scaled back. Unless Surface Pro has come along in the nick of time.

    "text": "  7.57pm BST    Final summary    To round up, here are the details of the iPad mini announced by Apple in San Jose today: Screen size: 7.85in Resolution: 1024x768 pixels, the same as the original iPad, but on a screen that&apos;s half the size Price: starting at $329 in the US and a reported 269 in the UK Connectivity: 3G and 4G versions and will Compatibility: will run all the existing iPad and iPhone apps The price isn&apos;t as low as some had thought Apple needed to go for to immediately kill the Kindle Fire or Nexus 7. They&apos;re likely breathing easier in Amazon as a result. The Nexus 7 has its fans, but it will also keep some pricing space beneath the iPad mini  which has to be good news for Google. The specs otherwise are precisely as expected - apart from the inclusion of 4G *cough*.       7.25pm BST       Here&apos;s the first take of our news story:  Apple has unveiled a mini version of its iPad as part of its move to muscle in on the market in smaller, cheaper tablets  one dominated for now by Amazon and Google. The new iPad mini - which can be held in one hand and has a 7.9 inch display - weighs in at 0.68 pounds and is 7.2 milimetres thin, a quarter thinner than the new fourth generation iPad which was launched at the same event. Prices in the US for the iPad mini start at $329 (206.40) for the 16GB version - a figure likely to disappoint many who had hoped it would come in at slightly less - with the cost rising to $459 (287.97) for the 4G version . &quot;Others have tried to make tablets smaller than the iPad and they have failed miserably,&quot; said Phil Schiller, Apple&apos;s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, who introduced the iPad mini in San Jose.

Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images      Updated at 7.21pm BST     7.13pm BST    Cook closes the show    Tim Cook says: &quot;We told you earlier this year you would see some incredible innovation from Apple this year, innovation only we could deliver. We think we delivered on that promise.&quot; He lists the achievements: - Mountain Lion OS - iOS 6 - two new iPods, nano and iPod touch, redesigned - new iPhone with 4in retina display - refreshed entire line of notebooks with retina display - announced unbelievably thin new iMac - third-generation iPad with retina display, replaced today with faster fourth-generation iPad - iPad mini He goes on to say: &quot;Yes, it has been an incredible year with all of these products and cloud services, this has been a prolific year of innovation for Apple.&quot; He delivers personal thanks to the team at Apple: &quot;They dedicate a huge parts of their lives to making the best products on earth.&quot; (This is a standard line at Apple events, but you don&apos;t hear it that often from CEOs.) &quot;It&apos;s a privilege and inspiration to work with them.&quot; And that&apos;s it  now the media scrum really starts as people try to get hands on the new devices.    Updated at 7.17pm BST     7.09pm BST       Now the question becomes: hot much of a threat is this to the Kindle Fire and the Nexus 7? The iPad mini has come in at the high end of the price spectrum; it still leaves room under the &quot;pricing umbrella&quot; for those rivals.    Updated at 7.10pm BST     7.08pm BST    First picture: the iPad mini       Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Philip Schiller introduces the new iPad mini during an Apple event in San Jose.  Photograph: Robert Galbraith/Reuters         7.07pm BST    iPad mini: from $329    Schiller returns after a video  there&apos;s even new Smart Covers for the iPad mini  to say that pricing for the 16GB, starts at $329. (That&apos;s going to disappoint some who hoped it would come in below $300.) The 4G version starts at $459. Preorders start Friday 26 October and then start shipping Wi-Fi versions all over the place, and 4G versions soon after starting in US.    Updated at 7.09pm BST     7.05pm BST       (So my own predictions that it wouldn&apos;t have 3G/4G turn out to be wrong  after I wrote the story to that effect, I started getting other information suggesting that carriers might be looking at it. Very dependent on sources, these things.)    Updated at 7.07pm BST     7.02pm BST       The CPU is dual-core A5 chip, there&apos;s a Facetime HD frontside camera, 5MP back side camera, all the WiFi. Lightning connector. 10 hour battery life. 3G/4G LTE too. So this means that it&apos;s got all the elements of the iPad 2 - but squeezed into device half the size. Plus 4G. So now the big question is what the prices will be.    Updated at 7.06pm BST     6.59pm BST       Schiller says: &quot;This is just a shrunken-down iPad, every detail is thought of... there is nothing as amazing as this. It&apos;s incredibly thin.&quot; He gets one out from one of the display boxes. And there&apos;s the shot you&apos;ll see: Cook holding this little tablet in his hand. On to questions now: will it have retina display? And what price? It will be 7.2mm thin, as thin as a pencil, 0.68lb, 53% lighter than the fourth generationiPad, &quot;as light as a pad of paper&quot;. He goes on: &quot;We were going to say books, but books are much heavier.&quot; &quot;What screen size have we picked and why? We want an iPad capable of running that amazing software without developers having to do extra work.. We wanted it to be easy. 9.7in for the big sibling, 7.9in for the new one. &quot;And it&apos;s 1024x768 - so that all the software for the original works. And works in portrait or landscape.&quot; (Little dig there at Nexus 7? Apps there can be particular about portrait or landscape.) &quot;For all your apps.. iLife.. iMovie... it is so much fun to sit there and play.&quot; &quot;If you like creating content.. if you love playing games..&quot; (If you like pina coladas ... and getting caught in the rain.. no, that&apos;s an old song.) &quot;Others have tried and failed miserably.&quot; Now he&apos;s going head-to-head with Nexus 7. On bezels: &quot;Theirs is thicker and heavier than iPad mini even though it&apos;s a smaller display. 7.9 v 7in ... the actual area 21.9sq in for the Android, 29.6 sq in  that&apos;s a huge difference, a third larger for the iPad mini. And what&apos;s the No.1 thing people do on their iPads? Surf the web.&quot;    Updated at 7.09pm BST     6.51pm BST          Apple's Phil Schiller announces the new iMac.  Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images         6.51pm BST    iPad mini    &quot;So what else can we do to help customers use i in ways they&apos;ve never thought of...&quot; The screen revolves to reveal a small iPad (no name yet) behind it. It is, as everyone has expected, the same 4:3 ratio.    Updated at 6.54pm BST     6.51pm BST          Apple senior vice president of worldwide product marketing Phil Schiller announces the new iMac during an Apple special event in San Jose.  Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images         6.50pm BST    Existing iPad line gets refresh, new connector, 4G in UK    &quot;Updated to the new connector, the Lightning connector... and some new cables for cameras, video out, HDMI.. all of this technology and performance is based on a system with a retina display.&quot;(Aha, this is the old iPad refreshed.)       6.49pm BST    New iPad    Schiller announces the &quot;fourth generation iPad. It&apos;s amazing, the pace the team is at, the pedal-to-the-metal engineering attitude, this is a powerhouse. &quot;Inside the A6X chip delivering even faster performance. Doubles the performance for CPU tasks [over the A5X] and graphics. Added new generation for image stabilisation.. and 10 hours of battery life.&quot; &quot;Also updating frontside camera, expanded LTE - includes Everything Everywhere.&quot;    Updated at 6.54pm BST     6.47pm BST       Cook says the iPad is &quot;taking the business market by storm.&quot; He says 94% of companies in Fortune 500 are &quot;testing or deploying&quot; iPads. (They seem to have been doing that a long  can aanyone point us to stats on how this figure has changed over time?) &quot;We&apos;re just getting started. Earlier this year we announced an iPad with a beautiful retina display. This has been the fastest selling iPad of all time. But we&apos;re not taking our foot off the gas.&quot; With that, Cook hands over to Schiller.    Updated at 6.50pm BST     6.44pm BST    iPad in education    Cook is talking about the use of the iPad in education. &quot;One of the things that&apos;s so amazing to us is how quickly iPad has been embraced in education&quot; (Sounds like a lead-in for the mini... which is meant to be aimed at education..) &quot;With iPad the possibilities are endless and we saw this early on, early this year we announced iBooks Author to allow it to be easy to create rich engaging multi-touch textbooks. .. are now available for 80% of the US high school core curriculum.&quot; (Hmm, but can kids get them? Obvious line is that if you make iPads more affordable then schools will buy in preference to PCs.)    Updated at 6.48pm BST     6.41pm BST    iPad    Cook is back and says that Apple has sold its 100 millionth iPad two weeks ago. &quot;This is unprecedented for a new product in a new category.&quot; &quot;We sold more iPads in the June quarter than any PC manufacturer sold in its entire PC line. It seems like every day there&apos;s another tablet shipping but when you look at the ones being used it tells a different story. iPad accounts for 91% of web traffic.. why is iPad so phenomenally successful? People love their iPads.. the big display, the fast fluid responsiveness, the front camera for FaceTime and the rear iSight camera which takes photos and video, they love that they can connect anywhere they can go, they love iPad&apos;s all-day battery life, and all of the amazing apps that have been optimised for iPad.&quot;    Updated at 6.45pm BST     6.39pm BST       Do twitterfolk think there&apos;s a point in optical drives? Here&apos;s one answer.. And plenty more saying &quot;no&quot;. Lots of people responding...    @charlesarthur can't even remover last time I used a DVD or CD. Years maybe.&mdash; Roberto Kusabbi (@RKTweets) October 23, 2012     @charlesarthur the day of the drive is done.&mdash; Jord Farquaad (@IveGotNoSocksOn) October 23, 2012     @charlesarthur I use my drive little enough that I'd rather save the weight/size.&mdash; Rob Styles (@mmmmmrob) October 23, 2012        6.37pm BST       Oh, you can get an optical drive &quot;for those who are stuck in the past..&quot;       6.36pm BST       The new iMac offers a combined NAND (flash memory) and the HDD (hard disc drive) in a single &quot;fusion&quot; drive. The operating system sits on the Flash and then all the apps and documents sit on the HDD. So the HDD isn&apos;t quite dead yet, though Apple is pushing NAND Flash as hard as it can.    Updated at 6.46pm BST     6.35pm BST          Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during  Apple's special event to introduce iPad Mini at the California Theatre in San Jose, California.  Photograph: KIMIHIRO HOSHINO/AFP/Getty Images         6.34pm BST       Schiller compares the new iMac to the old one, which looks fat. &quot;Isn&apos;t it interesting how something new can make the previous version instantly look old?&quot; The 2mm air gap between display and front glass has been removed, as hasthe optical drive. (Somewhere, the people who make blue diode lasers are weeping.) He&apos;s talking about the technologies  laser welding and plasma deposition processes. It&apos;s like a third year manufacturing degree course. Features include facetime camera, dual mics, stereo speakers, 40% less volume, and 8lb less weight. There&apos;s a &quot;serious computer in this thin design,&quot; Schiller says. (Nope, no optical drive. Is this the moment when the Superdrive began heading to the big junkyard in the sky?)    Updated at 6.46pm BST     6.30pm BST    New iMac    Schiller describes the iMac as the all-in-one computer.  A great design evolved over many years. It started in 1998 ... this really relaunched all of our products, how we make products ... epitomised something where we innovate and then relentlessly improve ... 7 generations of iMac, each one better than the last. Today the first of the new generation.  The screen shows very, very thin design  pretty much just a pane of glass. Plenty of hootin&apos; and hollerin&apos; from around here. It sort of looks like an iPhone 5 made extremely large. There&apos;s a very bright screen. It looks really thin though there&apos;s the suspicion that it&apos;s using black edging to hide the reality of the computer inside - rather like those fashion jeans that hide the hips.    Updated at 6.47pm BST     6.27pm BST    Mac mini    And now: the Mac mini. &quot;You knew there&apos;d be something called mini in this presentation, didn&apos;t you?&quot; teases Schiller - whose dry humour is hard to beat. Mac mini is the &quot;headless Mac&quot;  you can now get at it by taking the bottom cover off. There&apos;ll be a i5.i7 processor, with up to 16GB memory, up to 1TB HDD or 256GB flash. It will ship at $599. &quot;And other configurations&quot;. Also comes in a server configuration. &quot;All starts shipping today.&quot;    Updated at 6.30pm BST     6.24pm BST       There will be a &quot;powernap&quot; feature where the device can perform backups and updates while it&apos;s in &quot;sleep&quot; mode. Her&apos;s the pricing: $1699 for the 2.5GHz, 8GB RAM, 128GB NAND. The 15in model &quot;has been a bit hit&quot; but this is $500 cheaper. It &quot;starts shipping today&quot;. It&apos;s interesting how Apple gets these things lined up and makes them happen  none of the &quot;announce and wait&quot; that many other companies do. It also rather kills this Digitimes story which is headlined &quot;Rumor about delays in Apple launch of Retina 13-inch MacBook Pro emerge; but are quashed by Apple&apos;s supply chain partners&quot;. Having it both ways there.    Updated at 6.29pm BST     6.20pm BST       The new 13-inch Macbook Pro will be 0.75in thick, &quot;20% thinner&quot; than the current model. It weighs 3.5lb, much lighter, &quot;our lighest MacBook Pro ever&quot;. The optical drive has been removed, headed for the junkyard, it seems. The screen will be 13.3in diagonal, and 4x resolution  so it&apos;s 4.096m pixels, &quot;world&apos;s second highest-resolution notebook&quot;. 15% more pixels than others. By comparison with HD TV it&apos;s almost double the pixels. (Now - are extra pixels a selling point? Is the lack of a optical drive an anti-selling point? Macbook Air seems to have been selling fine without optical, so looking at this seems like the distinction between MacBook Air and MacBook Pro becomes minimal - except there are more pixels in the &quot;pro&quot; line.)    Updated at 6.27pm BST     6.16pm BST       Schiller says: &quot;It starts with Macbook.&quot; If you&apos;re waiting for the iPad mini, best hit the snooze button  Apple is going to work through the rest of the lineup first. However if you&apos;re interested in laptops and desktops, stick with us.    Updated at 6.26pm BST     6.15pm BST       Cook now turns to the Mac, which he says has been outgrowing PC market for the past six years. &quot;The Mac is consistently named No. 1 in customer experience and reliability&quot;. &quot;No1 desktop and No. 1 notebook in the US.&quot; Not sure what&apos;s meant by &quot;no.1&quot; in that. Not best-seller, but perhaps by some customer satisfaction thing. &quot;Going to continue innovating with the Mac... got some really great stuff.&quot; Cook hands over to Phil Schiller. Who today is not wearing taupe.    Updated at 6.16pm BST     6.14pm BST          The walls of the California Theater in San Jose are decorated with an Apple logo.  Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP         6.13pm BST       &quot;iBooks is better integrated with iCloud... you can tap one and begin reading just where you left off.&quot; Same as Kindle.. &quot;And you can tap on your favourite quote and share on Facebook and Twitter&quot;. Intriguing. One from Korea using &quot;crisp beautiful fonts&quot; and Japanese and Chinese. This is a big aim for the Kindle market. iBooks 3, free download now. (Some distance from Steve Jobs and &quot;nobody reads books any more&quot;.)       6.11pm BST       Cook is now giving App Store figures. He says 35bn apps have been downloaded, $6.5bn paid out to developers ($9.3bn total once you add Apple&apos;s 30% cut back in). He&apos;s now talking about iBooks and &quot;the bookshelf&quot;. Interesting point to emphasise.    Updated at 6.16pm BST     6.09pm BST       Tim Cook comes on stage, wave to the crowd. &quot;Morning! Morning!&quot; He says that 200m devices have upgraded to Apple&apos;s latest operating system iOS 6, the &quot;fastest upgrade rate every for any mobile operating system - for any operating system&quot;.    Updated at 6.15pm BST     5.52pm BST       OK, and the scrum of journalists and TV camerapeople and guests and everyone else are inside the theatre. Everyone is taking photos like it&apos;s their last chance. The theatre is sort of faded 1930s glamour; the same place where RIM held its BlackBerry Jam event a few weeks back, though apparently much less crowded than this is (where the 250 or so people are packing the ground floor; the circle above is closed off). 10 minutes or so to go.       5.35pm BST    iPad mini: ahead of the start...    Welcome to our liveblog on the expected launch of Apple&apos;s &quot;iPad Mini&quot; - for which the alternative suggested names are already &quot;iPad Air&quot;, &quot;iPad Play&quot; and even &quot;iPad U&quot; (Brian Hall on the latter - like the Wii U?). The anticipated details are that it will be 7.85in diagonally (so half the size in area of the existing iPad)  but what&apos;s unclear is the pricing, and whether it will have 3G/4G capability. The latter would mark it out from almost all the other 7in tablets, and particularly the Google Nexus 7, which has sold extremely strongly. We&apos;re also expecting that there will be updates to the MacBook Pro laptop line  perhaps adding a 13in &quot;retina display&quot; version, like the 15in one launched in June - and updates to the iMac and perhaps even the aging Mac Pro desktop lines. If you need a little reading ahead of time, here&apos;s what Steve Jobs said in October 2010 about 7in tablets; what we&apos;ve been hearing about starting prices (249 in the UK?); and whether it will have 3G or even 4G capability, and whether there might be a revised version of the &quot;big&quot; iPad which will have UK-compatible 1800MHz 4G. (Then again, given how much  judging by my Twitter feed  people hateEverything Everywhere&apos;s 36-per-month-for-500MB starting pricing on 4G, that might not be a hot seller.) Oh, and note our disclaimer. Along with a number of other European and UK journalists, Charles Arthur&apos;s travel and accommodation was paid by Apple.    Updated at 5.51pm BST  ",

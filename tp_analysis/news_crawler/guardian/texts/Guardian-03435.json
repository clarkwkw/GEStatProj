    "text": "The Witcher 2 debuted on PC last year, but this enhanced edition has been worth the wait, offering a wealth of improvements. Luckily, an early tutorial is one of them, as the fighting and alchemy system of the game can be dauntingly complex to attempt unprepared. Once understood, the game reveals itself as an RPG of the highest calibre, presenting a true maturity beyond its titillating nudity or bloodthirsty violence. A complex web of choices demands more than black-and-white morality and I frequently found myself pondering the best course of action  an unusually deep emotional investment in a fictional world. A competitive Arena mode is the single largest addition to be found, but returning players will notice tweaks and upgrades throughout. Meanwhile, newcomers willing to learn how to best exploit the combat will be irresistibly drawn into this dark fantasy offering. Skyrim finally has some real competition.",

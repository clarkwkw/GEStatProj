    "text": "What is ScorecardResearch? ScorecardResearch is part of a company called Full Circle Studies, which is owned by comScore. To put the size of comScore into some context, its factsheet claims it tracks more than three million unique websites worldwide and its methodology page says it has &quot;approximately two million worldwide consumers under continuous measurement&quot;. It provides market research data to website owners through a mixture of online surveys and the use of web beacons. According to comScore, websites elect to take part in the company&apos;s market research. The website owners place ScorecardResearch web beacons into the pages of their website.  When a browser loads a page that contains a ScorecardResearch web beacon, a cookie will be set. This, says comScore, allows it to observe &quot;browser-level&quot; behaviour, i.e. how often you return to a website or if, having visited one website, you go to another one that is related. The data that is collected is used to build up reports on internet behaviour and trends.  What information is ScoreCard research tracking?  ScorecardResearch&apos;s privacy policy says its tracking will collect information such as:- when your browser visited a website- what page of the website it was- the title of the web page - IP address If you elect to answer a ScorecardResearch survey, this may also be logged (so you are not shown the same survey again). Is the data ever matched to personally identifiable information?As with all cookies and web beacons, ScorecardResearch cannot identify an individual user who is using the computer to visit a website that contains a ScorecardResearch tag. However, the cookie may be used to observe certain types of browsing behaviours, which are then combined with other browser data to give a picture of what people are likely to do when they surf the web. What other ways does Scorecard Research track? What information?ComScore uses web beacons and cookies for other products in a similar way to ScoreCard Research. It&apos;s worth noting that comScore has a lot of products and services focused on digital audiences. How long is the data stored for? The data obtained through ScorecardResearch cookies is kept for up to 90 days. When it is aggregated to observe trends, it may be used for analytical purposes indefinitely.  If a particular site asks for detailed research about a topic, comScore says &quot;selected anonymous records relating to that specific site may be maintained indefinitely&quot;. What evidence is there that data is deleted? ScorecardResearch, like many third-party cookie operators, has its privacy policy vetted by TRUSTe. TRUSTe checks to see if ScorecardResearch does everything it says it does in its privacy policy. If it does, it gets a seal. It does not mean it is following any particular industry standard for privacy (except the one it holds for itself). A standard it does adhere to is the International Safe Harbor privacy principles. How is the data used? Is the data sold to third parties? &quot;The information is analysed and the resulting reports are shared with our clients,&quot; says comScore.  These reports aim to help companies understand internet behaviour. Some of the more general ones are presented publicly, such as a report about the effectiveness of pharmaceutical marketing or how popular sports content is in Europe. Do your cookies circumvent privacy-enhancing software, such as Tor? No, says comScore.

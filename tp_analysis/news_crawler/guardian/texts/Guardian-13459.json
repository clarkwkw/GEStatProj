    "text": "Age: 43 Appearance: The Corrs&apos; older half-sister. I know her  she&apos;s the CEO of Yahoo!. No, that&apos;s Marissa Mayer. Sandberg is Facebook&apos;s chief operating officer and the first woman on its board. So I was close! They&apos;re both alliterative-named women in charge of modern stuff. Yes. So close. Why is SS in the news, then? Added an &quot;If you don&apos;t know what you&apos;ve done, I&apos;m not going to tell you&quot; button for status updates? Turned the two &apos;o&apos;s in the Facebook logo into little ovaries? Had a child and named it &quot;Like/Dislike&quot;? None of those. She has written a book called Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, about how women canbest &quot;lean into&quot; (rather than turn away from) career success, and set up a foundation to help them do so. Let me guess  it is a feminist tract that has caused outrage among commentators who question her ability to talk from a position of privilege about the lives of the majority of women? Yes, with the added twist that they have been frequently doing so without reading the book. Impossible! No one in the media would ever dream of saying, printing or rendering in pixelsanything that hadn&apos;t been thoroughly researched, considered and investigated from allsides! Alas, some would and some have. The biggest row began with an article by Jodi Kantor (who did appear to have read the book) in the New York Times, which was sceptical about Sandberg and her thesis and included an out-of-context quote from an interview elsewhere that gave a negative impression of her, which the original piece didn&apos;t. Then what happened? Our own Daily Mail ran a piece that further distorted everything, Maureen Dowd followed up in the New York Times with another sceptical piece, alleging Sandberg&apos;s book and foundation were just moneymaking ventures. And then? The NYT printed corrections to her article and Kantor&apos;s, but by then everyone was off and running  especially in the blogosphere  and barely even pretending to have read the book, or anything, before laying into Sandberg, and hard. Life&apos;s a bag of utter balls sometimes, isn&apos;t it? You got that right, my friend. Still a backlash against the backlash now seems to be starting, so maybe we&apos;ll see a considered result in the end. Do say: &quot;I&apos;m going to get that book out of the library to see what I think.&quot; Don&apos;t say: &quot;A thousand online commentators can&apos;t be wrong.&quot;",

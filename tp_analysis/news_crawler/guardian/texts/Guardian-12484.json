    "text": "In late 2011, we made five predictions for higher education marketing for the network. A year on and it appropriate to look back at them  and suggest some more for the future. It&apos;s been an interesting 12 months, if that&apos;s the right word. Certainly a year of change, flux and uncertainty, and not a very comfortable one for many higher education institutions. But, as always in times of change, there are opportunities, particularly for universities to review and sharpen their offering to the outside world. So back to our five predictions for 2012: Prediction: HEIs will become increasingly divergent Reality check: this is happening and will continue to happen. According to Julian Beer at the University of Plymouth, who is leading a sector-wide study on university strategy, about a quarter of universities have updated their mission statements in the last two years, with seven signalling significant changes of direction. The departure of several members from the 1994 Group is further evidence of universities looking to create more distinctiveness for themselves as individual institutions. Students (and increasingly parents) are looking for clarity around university offerings and how they can distinguish one from another. The rise in tuition fees is bringing international options into play, meaning UK universities are competing on an ever broader stage. Prediction: investment will increase significantly Reality check: we were not suggesting this would happen overnight, rather develop in line with the growing need for differentiation. But the prospect of UK universities spending more than 20% of their revenues on marketing, as some US for-profit colleges do, has been debated. While this might seem an inflated figure, our estimate a year ago of most institutions spending between 0.75% and 1.5% of their revenue on marketing, including staff costs, now seems conservative. These levels are likely to significantly grow in the coming years. Prediction: marketing high-fliers will be attracted to HEIs Reality check: there has been a definite increase in the number of marketing and communications jobs being advertised. As for &apos;high-fliers&apos; this was intended as shorthand for higher education attracting experienced marketers into a sector that may not have been part of their career aspirations. Higher education has become much more high profile, in media as well as marketing terms. Universities are looking for marketing talent to help bring a fresh approach, not necessarily those who have &apos;grown up&apos; in higher education. Prediction: widespread customer relationship management (CRM) Reality check: From the experience of the universities that we have worked with (Warwick in particular last year), CRM is definitely becoming the norm, and increasingly sophisticated. The CRM focus of many universities is on prospective students, hardly surprising with student numbers looking uncertain across the board. But as we suggested last year, this now needs to be extended to a &apos;cradle to grave&apos; approach, on the basis of creating lifelong relationships. Managed as a two-way relationship, that communicates the benefits to alumni rather than simply subjecting them to a series of fundraising appeals, there is no reason why this cannot be achieved. It is important, though, to create and agree CRM strategy with those who responsible for implementing it before plunging into expensive technology solutions. Prediction: measurement of marketing effectiveness will matter Reality check: even if this process is difficult and a little painful, it is happening and surely must continue. And not just when it comes to recruitment. The importance of research impact is highlighted by the 20% weighting in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF). This is likely to have a knock-on effect within universities, with marketing investment coming under a similar level of scrutiny. But another more positive outcome of the run into REF could be a much closer understanding and, hopefully, respect between academics and professional marketers. But enough of the rear mirror view. What are our thoughts for the coming year(s)  and yours?  Universities will step up in terms of international recruitment. With less data and insight available, it&apos;s still more of an unknown, but a big opportunity for those that get it right. Institutions will set themselves challenging targets and marketing needs to be at the forefront of the recruitment drive, visa issues allowing.  There will be more consideration given to understanding and trying to manage demand. Universities have traditionally been good at, and focused on, the supply side. This &apos;inside out&apos; perspective must be counterbalanced by the &apos;outside in&apos;  the need to (try to) understand the marketplace and its likely future direction, both in teaching and research, as its impact on institutional strategy.  Marketing departments play an obvious and important role in this, a role not sufficiently recognised in our experience. For instance, course development and programme reviews could benefit from a greater degree of market insight and primary research among target audiences. A feel for the likelihood of &apos;new product&apos; success can, and should be, backed by evidence of demand.  As part of &apos;demand&apos; evaluation, we will see an increasing use of qualitative insights to complement quantitative data. There&apos;s no shortage of surveys amongst students, certainly undergraduate but at a time of change, let&apos;s place understand what is really going on. What factors are important to prospective students in their application journey? How many start by questioning whether university is right for them and how important are fees in this respect? Do their perspectives change once they are at their chosen institution? What are their views on &apos;value&apos; provided? And how does reality compare with expectation? These are some of the questions we think are worth asking. Please do share yours in the comments below.

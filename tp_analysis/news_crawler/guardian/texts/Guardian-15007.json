    "text": "Star Command (War Balloon, iOS, 1.50) owes a great deal to a certain space-bound TV and film franchise, so the timing of its release doesn&apos;t seem altogether an accident on the part of the developers. It&apos;s a game of two parts  Star Command involves building and equipping an intergalactic vessel, and filling it with crew members. The staff wear vaguely familiar red, yellow and blue tunics identifying the role they perform  soldiers, engineers or medics. Once the ship is ready it&apos;s time to take off into the galaxy and engage in some nifty space combat  both inside, as foes teleport (or beam) on board, and outside, when dealing with enemy craft. Battles win currency (not something Spock worried about too much in the heat of battle), which is then spent on upgrading the ship and crew. It&apos;s not revolutionary, and the combat gets pretty hard pretty quickly, but as a Space Opera sim it does the job in giving players a taste of life as Captain Kirk.",

    "text": "Fifa 13 has rocketed to the top of the UK software charts, shifting over one million units in its first week on sale. It&apos;s an achievement that has only previously been equaled by the last three Call of Duty titles. The latest instalment of Fifa&apos;s long-standing rival, Pro Evolution Soccer, stands at a respectable number five.  It&apos;s not only rather nice news for EA, the game has also delivered a hefty adrenaline boost to UK game sales figures. As industry news site MCV notes:  &quot;In hitting these incredible sales, FIFA 13 betters the week one numbers of FIFA 12 by 27 per cent in units and 31 per cent in value. Again, remarkable in the current in the current climate. &quot;Its success drove the overall market to a 196 per cent week-on-week gain in unit sales and a 282 per cent jump in revenue. FIFA 13 claimed 71 per cent of the UK&apos;s total video game unit sales last week and 80 per cent of its revenue.&quot;  Meanwhile, the latest World of Warcraft update, Mists of Pandaria, stalled at number four, stopping short behind Borderlands 2 and F1 2012.",

    "headline": "Former Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson diagnosed with thyroid cancer  reports", 
    "text": "Yahoo&apos;s ex-chief executive Scott Thompson, who quit on Sunday as Yahoo sought to defuse a row over allegations Thompson lied on his CV, has reportedly been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. After a board meeting on Sunday morning, the company announced that Thompson, who has led the embattled web giant for less than six months, would be replaced by Ross Levinsohn with immediate effect. Thompson&apos;s decision to step down from Yahoo was in part influenced by his cancer diagnosis, reports the Wall Street Journal. But his resignation had seemed inevitable amid demands by Daniel Loeb, an activist shareholder whose firm, Third Point, owns a 5.8% stake in the company. Yahoo did not immediately return calls from the Guardian. Thompson&apos;s diagnosis had reportedly been made even as the board was investigating why the his academic record had erroneously included a computer science degree  a falsehood that appears on Yahoo&apos;s regulatory filing. Over the weekend, Yahoo said it would appoint several new board members including Third Point&apos;s Loeb, the person who had had spotted Thompson&apos;s misstated academic record in a Yahoo regulatory filing in April. Yahoo also announced that Roy Bostock, Yahoo&apos;s chairman, would leave and be replaced by Fred Amoroso, a veteran technology executive. &quot;The board is pleased to announce these changes and the settlement with Third Point, and is confident that they will serve the best interests of our shareholders,&quot; Amoroso said in a statement on Sunday night. Despite a massive online presence, Yahoo has been struggling to keep up with Google and Facebook. Yahoo&apos;s share of overall US online ad revenues, which reached 15.7% in 2009, declined to just 9.5% last year, according to eMarketer. Yahoo shares rose 1.7% after Sunday&apos;s announcement. &quot;Investors are likely to take comfort in fresh leadership, particularly at the board level, as eight of the 11 board seats were named in the past year,&quot; wrote Evercore Partners analyst Ken Sena in a note. Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter said that the management changes were necessary, even though he worried that Yahoo would essentially start from scratch again with its strategy. &quot;As a practical matter, what this means for the company is that the past four months have been little more than a false start, and it must once again start at the beginning in terms of establishing a strategic direction,&quot; Schachter said in a research not. Analysts welcomed Levinsohn&apos;s appointment because of his history in media and advertising sales. Schachter said he may be &quot;auditioning to take on this role on a permanent basis.&quot; &quot;We view Mr Levinsohn as well-equipped to lead the organization and to build off of the company&apos;s core strengths  advertising products and digital media,&quot; said Credit Suisse analyst Spencer Wang. However, even with Levinsohn at the helm, Schachter said that Yahoo&apos;s future is uncertain: &quot;The bottom line is that the situation at Yahoo is a mess.&quot;",

    "headline": "Gas strategy unveiled by George Osborne", 
    "text": "George Osborne on Wednesday fired the starting gun on a new &quot;dash for gas&quot; that will partly use tax breaks for shale production, though the government admitted it did not know whether future gas prices would rise or fall. The chancellor used the autumn statement on the country&apos;s finances to unveil a long-awaited but highly controversial gas generation strategy that critics believe will lock Britain in to a high-carbon future. &quot;We are consulting on new tax incentives for shale gas and announcing the creation of a single office for unconventional gas so that regulation is safe but simple,&quot; Osborne told the House of Commons. With his more carbon-conscious energy secretary, Ed Davey, at climate change talks in Doha, Osborne said Britain should not miss out on the opportunities being enjoyed in the US where gas prices have plunged due to shale gas produced by horizontal drilling and &quot;fracking&quot;, where toxic chemicals are used to break up rock formations. The move triggered an angry reaction from environmental groups and businesses which believe their best interests are served by the UK building a more sustainable future using wind and other low-carbon power sources. &quot;The chancellor is misleading people to position shale gas as the answer to UK&apos;s energy woes. The impact of fracking in the US is irrelevant because energy experts say the US shale gas boom cannot be replicated here,&quot; said Joss Garman, political director at Greenpeace. &quot;Over a third of the UK&apos;s economic growth in the last year came from the low-carbon sector. By ignoring this and instead offering incentives to the gas industry, George Osborne is undermining crucial green growth.&quot; Andy Atkins, executive director at Friends of the Earth, said: &quot;The big polluters must think Christmas has come early - but if bad Santa Osborne&apos;s gas-fired energy strategy gets the go-ahead it will leave cash-strapped households and the environment with a thumping hangover for decades. While Davey attempts to show leadership at the Doha climate talks, the chancellor is hard at work handing out tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry that threaten to make a mockery of UK commitments to slash emissions.&quot; Andrew Raingold, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, which represents more than 50 leading businesses committed to a more sustainable future, said if the autumn statement was meant to heal the UK economy, the gas strategy &quot;is a route that will lead us straight back to economic decline&quot;. But in a foreword to the written strategy document, Davey said gas had a vital role to play meeting the UK&apos;s threefold challenge of keeping the lights on at affordable prices while moving towards a sustainable low-carbon future. The document, published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, envisages 26 gigawatts (GW) of new gas-fired power stations being constructed by 2030 but also leaves the door open to up to 37GW of this kind of capacity by the same date. The government has been warned by its own Committee on Climate Change that this ambition would break its commitment to limit carbon emissions while the future cost of gas supplies remains unclear. Gas prices have risen steadily over the last decade in Britain and companies as large as Shell question whether there can be any shale revolution in densely populated areas such as Britain and western Europe. And while America is eventually expected to start exporting its cheap gas, there will be huge rival demand for supplies from China and the rest of Asia. The document admits: &quot;ultimately there is significant uncertainty about future gas prices, so we need to be prepared for both high and low gas price scenarios.&quot;",

    "text": "     Mo Costandi writes our Neurophilosophy blog, describing research on things like the effect of marijuana on memory, amnesia in the movies, deep brain stimulation, and how a spaghetti western revealed differences between human and monkey brains. In this short film from the Wellcome Trust  part of their series on differerent ways to communicate science  Mo talks about the importance of having a strong online presence on Twitter and Facebook for the success of any blog. But the advantage of writing a science blog over other forms of publication, he says, is that, &quot;I can write what I want, when I want, without worrying about editors.&quot;  &quot;Do it. You&apos;ve got nothing to lose.&quot;",

    "text": "  6.34pm BST    Day one of conference: a summary    Students are now leaving the conference floor to take part in fringe events, which means we&apos;re wrapping up our live blog. We will be covering more of the National Conference tomorrow, when the organisation will select the next president. Here&apos;s a quick summary of today&apos;s events. Liam Burns made his final key-note speech to conference in his position as president. He warned student members against choosing a politics that is unrealistic: &quot;If you stand on this stage and claim that we should demand free education, living grants for all, we will win nothing.&quot; His speech was largely well-received, though many outside the conference hall still criticise his leadership in the run-up to Demo2012. They argue that the demonstration route, which dodged major landmarks, meant the protest was futile. Students also heard from local MP Paul Blomfield, who praised them on the back for the campaigns they have run on behalf of international students. After making a slow start, and getting a bit bogged down in a discussion about education maintenance allowance (EMA), the conference only discussed welfare policy proposals this afternoon. There&apos;ll be plenty more to discuss over the next few days, when students will get stuck into the policy proposals affecting further and higher education, union development and society and citizenship.       6.10pm BST    HEFCE donate 5m to student unions    The Higher Education Funding Council for England has given 5m to fund sustainability projects through students unions. Students can apply for a share of the pot by calling the NUS for a chat  details here.       6.02pm BST    Students: what the NUS has done for them    Chantel Le Carpentier, is modern history student at Essex University, where she will work as vice president for welfare next year. She says the NUS is helping her to tackle lad culture on campus:  Lad culture is a massive issue and Essex at the moment  it&apos;s a problem that we consider a welfare concern. But I feel like I&apos;m in a much stronger position to tackle these problems when I have the support of the NUS. The recent report they carried out into lad culture means that I have some real evidence to back up what I&apos;m saying. Through the NUS I&apos;ve also met a lot of other women&apos;s officers who are working in similar areas to me, so I&apos;ve had the chance to build up a network and share ideas.  Joe Gaytlen, economics student from Essex University, says that the NUS has is changing its ambitions, but for the better:  We&apos;re moving away from just calling for a free education and instead are working towards widening participation. There&apos;s much more that we can do in this area, like improving employability or making real changes to student welfare.     Updated at 6.06pm BST     5.16pm BST    No free lunch?    The welfare committee have also passed a motion calling for a fairer financial support system for students in further education. They note that free meals are available if you&apos;re a poorer student at a school sixth form, but not if you&apos;re studying at a college. The conference has agreed that the NUS should campaign to close the funding gap for those learning at a sixth college    Updated at 5.19pm BST     5.01pm BST    The history of the NUS conference    Here are a few facts about the history of the NUS Conference, courtesy of Guardian student blogger, John Morris:  With 1,000 delegates from 600 further and higher education institutions, representing more than 7 million students, the NUS&apos; national conference is the largest annual student gathering in the UK. The NUS was founded in 1922 with the aim to promote, defend and extend the right of students. It is the role of the conference to provide NUS with its yearly campaign agenda and to further the its national development. Deciding where NUS should be devoting its time. But the NUS has not always been like this. During the 1960s the NUS had gathered a reputation its high-quality research, being seen as one of the leading educational pressure groups. It rarely lobbied parliament or stood up for students. However, that all changed during the 1969 NUS National conference when a young Jack Straw convinced the NUS to get off its backside and do something. NUS rapidly changed shape. This new campaigning era saw NUS become the first national body to, in 1973, pass policy in favour of gay rights and, in 1983, stopping the government introducing tuition fees. A feat which unfortunately wasn&apos;t matched during the 50,000 strong 2010 protest. Only last year the NUS LGBT campaign was central in stopping the government&apos;s blanket ban on gay men donating blood.        4.51pm BST       Should student unions help their members organise tenants&apos; unions to secure cheaper rent? Some speakers feel it&apos;ll be too much of a faff...       4.48pm BST       Oh dear, the chair of the conference has been forced to stand up and defend herself after students accuse her of continually picking the same speakers to voice their opinions on student housing... Luckily the conference has voted to say that they do have confidence in her abilities.       4.43pm BST       We&apos;re back to debating student housing in the conference hall International students are the most vulnerable, says a representative from Kent University. They argue that that overeseas students should get more help when finding accommodation and that universities should be encouraged to act as guarantors    Updated at 4.43pm BST     4.20pm BST    Pictures from the day so far       Students gather outside Sheffield City Hall, Conference 2013.

Photograph: Will Bunce/NUS      Updated at 4.36pm BST     3.26pm BST    A short break    Students have left the conference hall to join fringe meetings but motions will commence in around 20 minutes Congratulations to all those on Twitter who correctly guessed Jack Straw. Straw was president of the National Union of Students from 1969-71, pictured below    Updated at 4.22pm BST     3.14pm BST       Back to student welfare... Conference is moving on to discuss the state of student housing. A representative from Swansea University says all students have a right to quality housing, but that in order to campaign seriously on this issue they must collect real and convincing evidence. They want to work with Shelter on improving housing standards and to lobby the government on the issues of homelessness and young people&apos;s vunerability in the housing market These amendments have been proposed:  Students at Northumbria University have added that the NUS should help student unions to set up non-profit Student Union Letting Agencies. Representatives from University of West England added that unions should also be encouraged to create &quot;Rate your landlord&quot; services  Both were passed by the conference    Updated at 4.03pm BST     2.58pm BST    Liam Burns statement on Thatcher's death    Here&apos;s a script of Liam Burns&apos; statement to conference, following news of Margaret Thatcher&apos;s death.  Now, let me be clear, Im the last person to agree with Margaret Thatchers politics or her policy record as prime minister. But we must not forget that an elderly woman has just died. She had family, friends, colleagues and supporters who will want to pay their respects at this time, and the media and public debate will now be dominated by this unexpected news. It&apos;s not just that this would reflect extremely badly upon us if we were to show disrespect at this time. We are better than that. We believe there is such thing as humanity. There is such a thing as sensitivity. And there is such a thing as respect. I ask you all to think very carefully indeed about how you respond to this news as conference continues.        2.54pm BST    Student finance    Both university and college students are grossly underfunded, says the welfare committee. They flag up the NUS report &quot;Pound in your Pocket&quot;, saying that this proves that poorer students are dropping out because of financial reasons. They want students to campaign for a national financial advice service and for extra support to be targeted at the poorest students. The committee has also proposed that in principle, EMA should be restored, although it recognises that students should fight for a better alternative. The proposal has prompted a debate about the merits of EMA. Mid-Kent College student Matt Stanley passionately urging the NUS to launch a &quot;Bring Back EMA Battle Plan&quot; while others say the fund wasn&apos;t meeting the needs of the poorest.       2.37pm BST    Going through the motions    Students are now voting for and against motions on student welfare. Each motion has been put forward by a student union or by a committee within the NUS. If a motion is passed then it will shape NUS policy over the coming year. Afterwards they&apos;ll discuss other areas of the NUS work which are broken into four other &quot;zones&quot;: higher education, further education, society and citizenship and union development.       2.23pm BST    Student quiz: picture 2    Ok, here&apos;s an easy one. Who can guess the name of the student politician below?     &nbsp;Photograph: PA         2.12pm BST       Students have also used Twitter to criticise other attendees for cheering after hearing news of Margaret Thatcher&apos;s death    Disgusted to hear about #nusnc13 cheering the death of Margaret Thatcher. Regardless of political views, she was a human being. #disgusting&mdash; Aimee 'Archie' Lyons (@ArchieLyons) April 8, 2013     Just heard that members cheered the news of Thatcher's death at #nusnc13. Utterly disgraceful. Makes me glad I'm not there.&mdash; Tom Nash (@TomCNash) April 8, 2013        2.10pm BST    Reaction from Twitter    Students continue to criticise Liam Burns after he defended last November&apos;s demonstration in his speech this afternoon    Last year's demo route was the equivalent of lobbying the bins outside parliament for policy change. *That* was the failure. #nusnc13&mdash; Emma Brownbill (@embrownbill) April 8, 2013        1.36pm BST    Liams Burns has left the stage, now the debates will begin    Here&apos;s a glance forward to a motion that is already causing a stir  proposal 701. Guardian student blogger John Morris tells us more:  The motions aims to create gender equality through allocating 50% of places to women. This will apply to conference delegates, Zone committees, Zone NEC and Block of 15. NUS President Liam Burns recently spoke out in favour of the motion saying that &quot;there is *something* that consistently stops a representative number of women from attaining positions of power. Gender balancing is about compensating for that while we seek to change the root causes.&quot; Whilst it is clear that there is a highly percentage of male representatives, 56% of students are women and yet only 36% of Presidents are, is it fair to allocate places based on gender? The consensus is mixed with Northumbria stating that they will be voting down the motion. At any rate this motion is likely to spark a lively debate later in the conference.     Updated at 4.26pm BST     1.32pm BST       Burns concludes by warning the NUS that it is in danger of choosing a politics that is about &quot;abstract arguments not real lives, selfish and totally out of touch&quot;    Updated at 1.33pm BST     1.29pm BST       Liam says student campaigners shouldn&apos;t act recklessly when another student&apos;s wellbeing is at stake. If you stand on this stage and claim that we should demand free education, living grants for all,&quot; he says, &quot;we will win nothing and worse we will have won nothing for the people who we could have achieved the most for.&quot;       1.26pm BST       Moving on to the topic of student finance, Liam says: the NUS needs to adopt policies and campaigns for getting money into students pockets that are evidence-based and realistic.  In higher education, that certainly doesnt mean the scandalously obvious cul-de-sac of demanding universal grants for all regardless of your wealth. In further education, that means asking why these students only get a tenth of the public subsidy that higher education students receive for their financial support? The conclusion to the question is certainly not going to the Government with the begging bowl request of bring back EMA  We don&apos;t want to bring back EMA, says Liam, we want something 10 times better. He adds that the way in which the poorest students in colleges are funded is a scandal    Updated at 1.26pm BST     1.21pm BST       Burns is heckled by an audience member as he praises the efforts of student unions who he says &quot;worked incredibly hard in the run up to Demo2012&quot;. Burns was in the middle of dismissing critics who said November&apos;s protest was pointless, when an audience member shouted &quot;Well it was your fault Liam.&quot; Many felt the NUS failed to put up a real fight in November when it organised a march that avoided London&apos;s most central locations.       1.18pm BST       He says lad culture only highlights to need to introduce gender balancing across NUS Committes. 60% of the students we represent are women, he says, but only a third of students union presidents are women. &quot;We cant shirk it off that easily&quot;       1.16pm BST    Lad culture on campus    Burns has now turned his attention to lad culture:  I know no one in this room would disagree with asserting that every single women student deserves to feel comfortable in her own union bar and that it is about time we called out sexual harassment dressed up as banter.        1.14pm BST       This April marks the month that the coalition&apos;s cuts take effect, and students don&apos;t escape untouched, he adds &quot;Of those seven million students, part-time students are the majority. They often have full-time jobs, full-time caring responsibilities, and a full-time challenge to make ends meet.&quot;       1.10pm BST       Typical student union speeches talk about solidarity and unity, but today the NUS needs to talk about division, says Burns. He adds that the student movement faces challenges: &quot;In most years, when the dividing lines get tricky, it might be enough to wallow in policies that might make us feel good but avoid making the choices that give us a better chance of winning for those who need victory most.&quot;       1.08pm BST    Liam Burns addresses conference       Liam Burns addresses NUS Conference 2013 Photograph: Will Bunce/NUS    Burns looks back at his time as president:  I was a first time delegate in 2007. Tony Blair was still Prime Minister, the global banking system hadnt collapsed, and the weather was better. Things have changed. Ive seen seven of these speeches including two at extraordinary conferences, and Ive given one already.     Updated at 4.34pm BST     1.05pm BST       Congrats to Graham Smith for correctly guessing our first famous student politician. It was indeed David Aaronovitch, journalist and broadcaster, who was president of the NUS from 1980-82.    Updated at 1.06pm BST     12.52pm BST       Students are now hearing from Maxwell Dlamini, secretary general of the Swaziland Youth Congress and former pesident of theSwazi NUS. Diamini has been refused permission to leave Swaziland, so is addressing conference by video message. Dlamini was arrested, along with political activist Musa Mgudeni, on the eve of the pro-Democracy protests on April 2011 and charged with possession of illegal ammunition, although he denies this charge. The Guardian&apos;s Frederika Whitehead wrote about his story:  His supporters say that the Swazi government is trying to smear Dlamini because he is a popular and well-known figure in Swaziland having led many battles with the government on behalf of the students since he took office. Dlamini was voted in as president of the NUS in October 2010 and has since led campaigns against increased tuition fees, against proposed cuts to scholarship programmes, and in favour of compelling the Swazi government to honour its constitutional commitment to introduce free primary school education.     Updated at 1.38pm BST     12.43pm BST    Paul Blomfield MP for Sheffield Central addresses Conference    Here&apos;s what Blomfield says about the government&apos;s stance on international students &quot;Nothing exposes this government - and the fact that it puts ideology and popularism before common sense - more than the decision to include foreign students in immigration figures. &quot;International students aren&apos;t just an economic benefit to our country they add intellectual robustness to our campuses and add diversity to our cities. &quot;I hope to see a debate in House of Commons before the summer, and I encourage you to campaign hard to bring about a change to the decision.&quot;       12.22pm BST    Student quiz: picture round    Things are running slightly behind schedule in Sheffield (students, eh?). But to keep you entertained, here&apos;s a game of &quot;name the former-student politician&quot;. Here&apos;s pic number one. Hats off to the first person who can name this young chap. (We will try to include some people who did not find a career in the Labour party, though as commenters have pointed out this will be hard.)     Photograph: ITV / Rex Features      Updated at 2.24pm BST     12.09pm BST    Demo2012: a bad memory?    Student paper,the Mancunion, reports this morning that November&apos;s student demonstration failed to achieve any national policy change and left the organisation &quot;less credible&quot;. Demo2012, which was marked by a poor turnout, cost the NUS 155,000, it adds. It&apos;s likely that Liam Burns will use his final speech as president to discourage the NUS from routinely holding national demonstrations. Many within the organisation will disagree, arguing that protests should instead be made more high profile.    Updated at 12.12pm BST     11.26am BST       Some student attendees are bubbling over with enthusiasm ahead of today&apos;s events    Our delegation having a democratic jump.

Pearce may be considered the front-runner for NUS president, but we&apos;ve been reliably informed that the Sheffield student union coffee shop prefers Baars...    If @sheffieldsu coffee shop was backing a candidate, it'd probably be Vicki Baars. Viva la Coffee Revolution #nusnc13 twitter.com/richardalderma&mdash; Richard Alderman (@richardalderman) April 8, 2013        10.43am BST    Who's running for NUS president?       Toni Pearce outside Sheffield City Hall, NUS Conference 2013 Photograph:Will Bunce/ NUS    Before we get stuck into the days debates, heres a quick summary of which candidates are running for the top spot  The front-runner is Toni Pearce, the current vice-president for further education. Shes a favourite with Labour Students and has the backing of Liam Burns. Pearce didnt go to university but instead rose through the NUS ranks after becoming union president at Cornwall College. If Pearce is elected tomorrow she will be the first president to come from an further education (FE) background. She wants to reach out to the students the NUS isnt usually associated with, including adult learners, apprentices and prisoners.  Toni Pearce manifesto  Also in the running is Vicki Baars, a biomedical sciences graduate from Leeds Metropolitan University and vice-president for union development. Shes the most left-wing candidate, famed for causing a rumpus among students after penning some questionable political rhymes. Baars wants to get more people involved in their student union and campaign for a free education.  Vicki Baars manifesto  Peter Smallwood, a politics graduate from Brunel University, is one of few Tories within the NUS. Smallwood, who has adopted the old Tory slogan Back to basics, believes the organisation is too inward-looking. He says hell campaign for an end to dodgy landlords and call for student loans and grants that truly cover the cost of student living.  Peter Smallwood manifesto  And finally, theres the carbon rod. Samuel Gaus, a student officer at University College London, is standing on the rods behalf. The rod is inspired by a Simpsons episode and is presented as a sign of student disillusionment with the NUS. Let Gaus explain:   As an Inanimate Carbon Rod, it has already done more than any National President in the last 3 years to challenge the agenda of the government. From not attacking student protesters; to not refusing to support the 201 0 protests when students needed it most; to not telling the government that it was fine to cut bursaries, it has consistently put its status as an Inanimate Carbon Rod above the temptation to sell out and shamelessly promote itself.  Rod manifesto Voting for the next NUS president will begin at 10:30 tomorrow morning.    Updated at 4.34pm BST     10.04am BST       Hello and welcome to todays live blog on the NUS National Conference 2013, coming to you from Sheffield City Hall. The NUS conference is a three-day long affair where students from across the UK will elect the next president, vice presidents, negotiate a budget and shape future NUS policy. The organisation has had a difficult time lately  from the pelting of fruit that president Liam Burns suffered at the end of Novembers student demonstration, to the inanimate carbon rod debacle (more on this later). The organisation has received flak for being out of touch with its members and for not fighting hard enough on their behalf. But as the countdown to the next general election begins, many within the NUS feel now is their chance to ramp up campaigning and put education back on the agenda. And its today that students will decide what the NUS should be fighting for over the coming years. Should it plan another anti-fees demo? Or is it time for campaigners to ditch the call for free education and grants for all, as the higher education committee will propose later today? The NUS is divided. Theres plenty to be discussed,  as this hefty 114-page document testifies. Funding and demos aside, students will debate the problems facing college students, the state of school careers advice and female representation in student politics. At midday president Liam Burns will also deliver his final conference speech, where he will outline how he believes the NUS should focus its energies in future years.    ",

This video captures scenes from their summer and autumn 2011 installation cruises throughout the northeastern Pacific Ocean, just off the coast of southwestern Canada and northwestern United States. In this video, you&apos;ll see a variety of beautiful and mysterious deep-sea and benthic creatures, such as gently pulsating jellies and angelic gliding rays, elegant brittle stars and delicate sea fans, and forests of tube worms, affixed to giant black smokers on the sea floor, thriving in sulfur-rich waters with temperatures exceeding a hundred degrees celsius:         Visit Ocean Networks Canada&apos;s Vimeo channel [video link].  The Ocean Networks Canada Observatory uses both VENUS and NEPTUNE Canada cabled networks to support research into marine environments ranging from the coast to the deep ocean. It allows for real-time interactive experiments designed to increase our understanding of ocean health, ecosystems, resources, natural hazards, and marine conservation. The Observatory is a national facility led by the University of Victoria on behalf of a pan-Canadian consortium of universities and partners.

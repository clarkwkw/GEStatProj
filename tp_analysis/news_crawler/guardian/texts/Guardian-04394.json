    "text": "Bolton&apos;s Bench is a stretch of rising ground at the lower end of the town named in memory of Lord Bolton, master keeper in the 18th century. The town&apos;s cemetery lies nearby and from there a gravelled track runs south-east along The Ridge, parallel to the Beaulieu Road. The Bench makes a fitting starting point for a leisurely walk in company with ghosts of the past. Though not easily seen, this area is littered with scars on the landscape etched by1,000 years of human activity. Almost a hundred years ago, the sound of marching boots would have been commonplace. It was on this ground that the 15,000 men of the Immortal 7th Division prepared for despatch to the Somme. One local story recounts how, some months afterwards, a handful of men were drinking disconsolately in a village pub. Someone asked: &quot;Where are the rest?&quot; The officer looked up from his glass and replied: &quot;We are the rest.&quot; More recently, the area was a hive of activity when taken over by USforces in the second world war. Down the slope towards the Beaulieu Road, Park Pale forms a miniridge that dates at least to the time of Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I. It marks the boundary of an ancient deer park that she had much enlarged as a living larder to provide the huge amount of venison required for royal banquets. To the east is what appears to be a Lilliputian version of the sunken lanes found in other parts. This was cut into the heath by ponies bearing Lymington sea salt to be traded in market towns to the north. They often carried forest charcoal on their journey home. Leaving their tracks, to loop through White Moor towards town, we enter an area of sandy heathland rich in lichens. Several cladonia species are easily found. Some have fruity bodies that stand up as little red spikes, prompting their popular names of &quot;devil&apos;s matchsticks&quot; and &quot;British soldiers&quot;.",

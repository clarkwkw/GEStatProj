    "text": "    Hummingbirds are remarkable animals. For example, they are amongst the smallest vertebrates in the world and yet, they can be found living comfortably in the Andes mountains at elevations where it is difficult for humans to breathe. They manage this feat by going into torpor at night, a metabolic &quot;trick&quot; where they lower their body temperature at night so they don&apos;t starve to death in their sleep.    They can flap their wings as fast as 100 times per second, and they can hover, fly backwards, and even upside down. At rest, a hummingbird&apos;s heart rate ranges from 250-500 beats per minute, depending upon the species and, when excited, their heart rate can jump to an amazing 1,260 beats/min. Yet, when in torpor, hummingbirds slow their heart rate to just 36 beats per minute. To support such extreme metabolic demands, hummingbirds must consume 1.5 times their body weight in nectar daily -- much more when raising chicks. They also capture and consume small insects in flight to meet their daily protein requirements, a behaviour known as &quot;hawking&quot;.  This lovely video interview provides more information about hummingbirds (and how to film them) as described by the principle cinematographer of the PBS NATURE television programme, Hummingbirds: magic in the air:             Visit PBS&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].

    "text": "Under the big oaks by the gate to the marsh the drizzle feels less but the gloom is worse. The whole sky is deep pencil-lead grey, except for a slit of brighter cloud on the northern horizon. The light and the rain mean that I see the dozen or so reed buntings flitting along the dyke even more poorly than usual. They always move in staggered sequence as I pass, the nearest triggering a neighbour&apos;s flight, so that they register not as one flock, but as an aggregate of half-seen individuals. Eventhis understates the fragmentary nature of my daily encounters with the birds. In truth I have barely seen one whole reed bunting all winter. The lattice of willow whips along the dyke breaks them down so that they are always revealed as an angular, cubist tangle of glimpses  a wing here, the flirting white bars of a tail there, and a head and shoulders poked cleanly from a perch as one stops momentarily to grill the intruder. Occasionally in high spring a singing male reed bunting will stand out in full sunlight, the plum-like black head sharp within its blossom-white rosette. More typically, however, the species retains about itself an aura of self-effacement, as if it had a sense that it is too dull in colour and tuneless in voice to warrant full attention. Yet this much, reed buntings proclaim loudly about our experience of nature. So many of our living neighbours  the leafless trees, the dank grasses and flowerless plants, the expired fungi and voiceless birds  hardly ever acquire the foreground of our minds. Yet every single one of them is integral to that magical uplift in spirits which is the great gift of a walk in wild space. Without the reed buntings we would not notice so keenly the crack in the sky and that widening pasture of blue. Nor would we feel so blessed by the warmth of that sun in our faces.",

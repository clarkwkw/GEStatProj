    "text": "There have been plenty of video games about the end of the world. Until now, however, none of them have featured feral pomeranians warring with zebras for control of Japan&apos;s streets. Set after a mysterious catastrophe has wiped out the city&apos;s human population, Tokyo Jungle is a free-roaming eat-&apos;em-up in which players pick from a menagerie of pets, zoo animals and beasts of burden and thentry to survive for as long as possible. If it sounds daft, that&apos;s because it is  gloriously so. But beyond the four-legged fisticuffs there&apos;s a surprisingly deep and demanding game here. Like every camp classic, it has some rough edges  the controls are a little spongy, the graphics boxy and the action can get unfairly hectic. But for the most part, the glitches add to the charm. In another, better world, David Attenborough is signing up to voice thesequel.",

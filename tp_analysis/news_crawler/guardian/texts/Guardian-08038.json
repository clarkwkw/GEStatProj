    "text": "When we talk about technology, we tend to think of computers, smartphones or operating systems. Is Android better than Apple? Does Nokia make better phones than HTC? The prosaic stuff  fridges, washing machines and cookers  get overlooked, possibly because we don&apos;t upgrade them as often as our smartphones, tablets and cameras. Yet we use those pieces of kit as regularly and arguably as intimately as we do our phones. You might not be able to put a picture of your dog or your baby on your fridge as wallpaper, but you probably go to it as many times a day as, say, you snap a picture on your smartphone. So if you haven&apos;t been in the market for a new dishwasher recently, you might have missed out on just how much that prosaic but vital home appliance technology has moved on. Now there are fridges that can tell you what&apos;s in them as you&apos;re on your way home and suggest what you might make for supper, and dishwashers that use a mineral byproduct of mining to dry your plates in order to save energy. Siemens showed off its incoming connected-home technology at IFA in Berlin on Thursday, and the future for your appliances is really rather fun. Take that fridge. What&apos;s in yours? Mine probably contains some butter, a handful of eggs, some tomatoes and a hunk of cheese, along with a bottle of Diet Coke and some raspberries I bought at the weekend and which are on the cusp of going off. That&apos;s from memory, but in a couple of years&apos; time, your fridge will have two cameras in it and recognition software. In a couple of years&apos; time  probably around 2014, according to Siemens  your fridge will be able to send that information to an app on your smartphone, and from that list of ingredients, offer you a choice of recipes for what you might fancy for supper. If you haven&apos;t got everything the recipe needs, it will also generate a shopping list so that you can stop off at the supermarket on the way home and pick up the remaining ingredients. Once you&apos;re home, complete with your shopping, you can pull up that recipe on your tablet. Siemens demonstrated the app on an iPad but says support for Android is coming. But as you chop up the tomatoes for the quiche the app suggested you make, your fingers are going to be sticky and you don&apos;t want them on your pristine tablet&apos;s screen. No problem: send it to the motion-sensitive projector installed next to the cooker and have it projected down on to your work surface. That projection is touch-sensitive, so you can scroll through the pages on the wipe-clean worktop. Ready to put the oven on? The app will send the temperature and timer information to the cooker. All you have to do is assemble the ingredients and put them in the oven. Once you&apos;re done with your meal, load the dirty dishes into the dishwasher, which, when you bought it, had to be told how hard the water is where you live. The connected dishwasher will be able to do that for you too: the tablet app uses the device&apos;s location settings to check online what the water hardness is in your area and then beams that information to the dishwasher to set it automatically.     A Siemens dishwasher app checking water hardness.    When the dishwasher has finished with your plates, rather than using more energy to blast hot air at them to dry them, Siemens&apos; appliances instead use zeolites, which heat up when they come into contact with water: the heat they use dries the plates and cutlery inside the dishwasher, reducing electricity. What about a cup of coffee? Your coffeemaker will be able to tell you, again via the app, if it&apos;s got enough beans in it or if you need to add some more. But what if it goes wrong? Via the tablet app, you will be able to connect by video to customer support, where the person on the other end of the camera will be able to access your device remotely to tell you what the problem is. All of this sounds futuristic, but in fact it builds on existing technology that we already have in place in our homes. Siemens says its connected-home appliances will work with your Wi-Fi network, and won&apos;t require vast dollops of bandwidth to use the internet-based functions, such as connecting to customer service: even a ropey 2Mbps connection will cope with the remote customer service function. All of this is part of &quot;the internet of things&quot;: right now you might have half a dozen things that connect to the web. In the not too distant future, more and more hitherto &quot;dumb&quot; physical objects  such as fridges and dishwashers  will be equipped with devices that allow them to communicate with the web, become part of the internet  and crucially, interact with us. Your car will be able to download content from the web to keep the kids entertained on a long journey, and also book itself in for a service; your printer won&apos;t need you to respond to warnings about low ink but will simply go online and order it in the background. The connected home is just part of it.",

    "text": "Windows Mobile can&apos;t yet offer the same diversity of titles as the iPhone or Android, but with phones such as the Nokia Lumia getting a big push and needing more apps to consolidate their place in the market, more games will soon be arriving. Crimson Dragon: Side Story is one. Billed as the spiritual successor to the classic Panzer Dragoon franchise, the game (Windows Phone 8, Microsoft, 79p) has an impressive pedigree behind it with many of the original series&apos; developers on board. It&apos;s a side-scrolling shoot-em-up with added dragons. The player&apos;s fire-breather moves forward independently, as you fly up and down to avoid obstacles while targeting enemies. The dragon is upgradeable as the game goes on, with new secondary and special attacks unlockable to help progress through the Story and Mission modes, but it&apos;s the visuals that really impress. The gorgeous 3D backgrounds are beautiful, and make it a pleasure to look at. The occasionally awkward controls could do with tweaking, but it&apos;s a solid effort from developers with an exciting background. Gunslugs (iOS, OrangePixel, 1.49) also wears its influences on its sleeves, with the eponymous invertebrate a clue to the style of gameplay on offer. It&apos;s a run-and-gun shooter, as epitomised by the mighty Metal Slug series, with the controls stripped back to work on a touch screen and many movements automated. It&apos;s hard, as fans of the genre would expect, but not frustratingly so, and the authentic 8-bit graphics add to the nostalgic feel. However, it&apos;s the randomly generated nature of the levels that really gives this game replayability, with landscapes changing and new weapons altering the experience every time it&apos;s booted up.",

    "text": "Carving out a niche for itself between the two blockbuster movies, Star Trek follows up on the fate of the vagabond Vulcans, now missing one home planet, while reintroducing the reptillian Gorn aliens into the rebooted canon. The game benefits from voicing by the films&apos; cast and from their likenesses, but that, sadly, is where the praise ends. This largely co-op outing proves glitchy and frustrating, with the twin leads of Kirk and Spock frequently tripping over or blocking each other. Objectives are often unclear, even with the aid of the near-omnipotent tricorder. Star Trek isn&apos;t as bad as many movie tie-ins, but that&apos;s damning it with faint praise. A wholly underwhelming effort.",

    "text": "Ruth Arnold, head of corporate communications, University of Sheffield Show as well as tell: remember the power of image and the experience Universities are text heavy places and research is often weighed in term of peer review. But what of those who don&apos;t spend their time perusing academic journals? What does our work mean to their lives and the challenges they face? Media and communications can be part of a back-stage team helping to tell the story of research. As a press officer, I initially acted as a translator between the world of the researcher and the interested reader, endeavouring to stay faithful to the former while speaking the language of the latter. Yet nothing has ever had quite as much impact as taking a journalist into a lab where they can also speak to a scientist. Or onto a &apos;factory floor&apos; where researcher, businessman and apprentice work side by side solving real life problems. It is one thing to read about what we do but quite another to experience it. This creates advocates for the changes universities can make to the world. When you are speaking to people for whom the very word &apos;university&apos; is weighed down with baggage, media and communications can help put that research onto a different stage, capture attention and imagination. This may be a short film or a week-long festival which blows the cobwebs off our image. It may be taking science out to primary schools to show children in person that knowledge carries opportunity and university can be for them. It does not need to dumbed down, it just needs to show a wider audience what they might otherwise miss. When I first worked in universities, more than a decade ago, carefully written and reviewed press releases were how we reached over the wall of the ivory tower. Today we are opening our doors, and the old rules are being rewritten. In November when Sheffield was named University of the Year at the THE Awards, the news was out on Twitter before we&apos;d left the event, and within a day was retweeted in Chinese more than 800 times. This is not control, it is telling and showing a story and then letting the wave spread. Ken Punter, digital and online communications manager, University of Warwick Summarise research, make it engaging, then link to the full report and data In response to the question: how are HEIs going to communicate the impact of their research and help meet the criteria for the 2014 Research Excellence Framework?, here at University of Warwick, part of the answer is the creation of a website called the Knowledge Centre. Using a magazine style format, the Knowledge Centre, managed by the communications office in close collaboration with research academics, is a vehicle to communicate Warwick&apos;s research outcomes and impact in the most user-friendly way possible. With no loss of academic integrity, research is communicated through professionally written articles and audio and video content. If there is any advice that I would give about successfully communicating research impact, it would be to first summarise and make the content engaging and then make a clear link to the full report and data. For Warwick, achieving the second aim means linking to the Warwick Research Archive Portal (WRAP), from the Knowledge Centre. WRAP is the university&apos;s open access research website containing; journal articles, doctoral dissertations, book chapters, conference papers, working papers and more. While still a relatively new initiative the Knowledge Centre has attracted the attention of a wide and varied audience. The traditional news media have referenced and linked to its content, but so to have readers as varied as Commonwealth minsters, BAFTA and Stephen Fry - along with a proportion of his large Twitter following. Katrina James, press officer, University of Bath Train academics to talk about their work to a lay audience Marketing communications professionals essentially have a translation role; we take high-impact research and work with academics to make it comprehensible and engaging for non-academic audiences. Here at the University of Bath, we&apos;re working to ensure that not only are we sending out written releases in plain, non-academic English, but also that our research staff are thoroughly prepared to talk about their work to a lay audience. To do this we meet individually with researchers before starting work on promotional activity. We identify the risks and benefits of promoting their research and make sure they are prepared to answer any difficult questions in a jargon-free manner. We&apos;re very fortunate in that we have staff in our communications team with media training experience. They have run sessions with our research academics, internally, in an environment in which skills can be practised in front of a camera or in an interview situation. We&apos;re also responding to the increased demand for multimedia news content. Our team has a dedicated video and multimedia officer who specialises in highlighting the impact of the university&apos;s research, making it interesting and easy to consume. Kevin Mulhern, head of communications and external affairs, Queen&apos;s University Belfast Do not ignore traditional methods of research dissemination Communications staff in HE institutions have been increasingly using a myriad of social media tools to try and convey the impact of their researchers&apos; vital work to various audiences. At Queen&apos;s University Belfast we&apos;re no stranger to such methods. Indeed, we were one of the first institutions to have our own online channel QTV, featuring leading researchers. In aiming to help our researchers meet the impact criteria, however, it has become clear that communicators who ignore traditional methods in the race to solve the dissemination dilemma could be making a big mistake. &apos;A good story, well told&apos; remains the gold standard in helping our researchers meet the suggested impact criteria. A simple illustration originates with a news release first issued in 2008 and updated many times since as the research has developed: South east Asia has the world&apos;s worst case of ongoing mass poisoning where up to 70 million people are affected by arsenic poisoning. Dr Bhaskar Sen Gupta from Queen&apos;s School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering, alongside his Indian partners, created the first working low-cost chemical free arsenic removal plant designed to tackle the problem. It was our job to inform the world of this discovery, and with a plain, old-fashioned planned PR campaign we had media outlets across the globe covering the story. How does that help Dr Sen Gupta meet the impact criteria? Simple - as a result, Dr Sen Gupta has been contacted by numerous funders and prospective partners worldwide. He is now developing plants in various sites including Washington State (United States), Cambodia and Malaysia. Alongside the traditional funders, those who read about his work in the media, are now its financial backers, enabling the expansion of the research and supporting PhD students. The bottom line is, with every follow-up news story issued by our communications team, Dr Sen Gupta receives even more inquiries. As a result, he is saving even more lives and preventing others from falling seriously ill. If that isn&apos;t impact, I&apos;m not sure I know what is. Alistair Jarvis, director of communications and marketing, University of Birmingham Impact hinges on the accessibility of research. It is our job to make research accessible Ahead of the REF, communications professionals can support academics to evidence and explaining impact, using their skills in presenting research in an accessible way to support the develop of lucid REF impact case studies. At the University of Birmingham, the marketing and communications team supports academic researchers to communicate their research to the public, media and policy makers and manages a range of activities which support public engagement with research. We host the Ideas Lab project that works proactively with external media companies to simulate new programmes and projects that are based on academic research and use the university&apos;s academic experts. It acts as a bridge between academics and TV, radio and multimedia producers. The University of Birmingham Community Day, led by the marcomms team, brings more than 10,000 members of the public to campus to learn more about the university&apos;s research. More than 100 academic researchers share their research with the public through this event. To further community engagement with research, the Birmingham Speakers Programme provides university speakers free of charge to community organisations. The Birmingham Policy Commissions and Birmingham Brief support academics to communicate their research to policy makers. The Birmingham Policy Commissions bring leading figures from the public, private and third sectors together with Birmingham academics to generate new thinking on contemporary issues of global, national and civic concern. The outcomes are then debated at public policy events in Westminster and at fringe events at the major UK political party conferences this year. Written by academics experts and promoted by marcomms the Birmingham Briefs provide concise, relevant and timely expert comment that demonstrates the breadth and quality of Birmingham&apos;s research. Nick Perkins, head of research communication, Institute of Development Studies Understand how research knowledge makes a difference to policy and public dialogues In the current context of public sector austerity, academic research must find ways to demonstrate its value. This means that research communication strategies that rely on a handful of peer reviewed articles for million pound research projects appear increasingly underpowered. The challenge however is to understand how research knowledge makes a difference to policy and public dialogues. The Impact and Learning Team at IDS, which sits in our communication department, is using action research to figure this out. In this context, the mix of common sense and innovation which characterises the best marketing can be useful. Whether it&apos;s about using the opportunities offered by social media to build networks, or implementing effective search engine optimisation strategies. But marketing ideas also offer insights for open access approaches, where it&apos;s been proven that the more often your material is placed in repositories on various platforms the more likely it is to be used. Similarly marketing has influenced the way we approach the design of proposals, where as a minimum the researchers must think about key audiences to influence and how to frame their research to get these audiences&apos; attention. This policy entrepreneurship works best when there is a healthy combination of common sense, opportunism and innovation at work. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

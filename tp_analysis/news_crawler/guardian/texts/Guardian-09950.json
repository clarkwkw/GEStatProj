    "text": "Jupiter, conspicuous at magnitude -2.8, rises in the NE as darkness falls tonight and stands 30 high in the E by 21:00 as Orion rises below it. Located between the horns of Taurus, and 6 to the upper-left of Aldebaran, the giant planet is the brightest object in our night sky until the morning star, Venus, rises in the E three hours before sunrise. Our chart depicts a region of the eastern evening sky that begins 15 above Jupiter and reaches up to the familiar &quot;W&quot; formed by the main stars of Cassiopeia. By 21:00, that &quot;W&quot; lies in the zenith where, if our sky is relatively free of light pollution, its stars gleam against the background of the Milky Way as it arches overhead from W to E. Sweep the Milky Way through binoculars and you may discover not only double stars and stars of pronounced colour, but also knots of stars in the form of so-called open star clusters. Brighter and more obvious examples of such clusters are the Pleiades, just below our chart area, and the V-formation Hyades cluster that lies beyond Aldebaran. Still brighter, but perhaps less obvious, is the cluster that includes the brightest star on our chart, the mag 1.8 Mirfak in Perseus. Called the Alpha Persei Cluster, its stars spill over more than 3 of sky (mainly SE from Mirfak), lie some 600 light years away and formed perhaps 60 million years ago. Halfway between Mirfak and the mid-star (Gamma) of Cassiopeia&apos;s &quot;W&quot; is the famous Double Cluster. This pair of star clusters is just visible to the unaided eye but make a striking sight through binoculars or a telescope. Both contain numerous young and luminous blue giant stars whose light reaches us across a gulf of some 7,000 light years. The cluster closest to Cassiopeia formed a mere 6 million years ago, while the other is only half as old. Of course, this distance is as nothing compared with the 2.5 million light years that separates our Milky Way from M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, whose oval glow is plotted in the upper-right quadrant of our chart. We now believe that M31 is on course to collide with the Milky Way in another 4 billion years or so. Finally, keep an eye on the Demon star Algol in Perseus which dips from its normal brightness at mag 2.1, comparable with Almach, to mag 3.4, dimmer than Epsilon, every 69 hours as a fainter component star takes 10 hours to eclipse its companion. Its next evening minima in brightness for the UK are due at 21:23 GMT on the 24th and 18:12 on the 27th.",

Cook&apos;s opening: &quot;As a company and as individuals, we are defined by our values. Unfortunately some people are questioning Apple&apos;s values today, and I&apos;d like to address this with you directly. We care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain...&quot;   Cook seems a lot busier with the emails than Steve Jobs was. Or the emails leak more easily. Setting the record straight about our privacy policy changes &gt;&gt; Google Public Policy Blog Google is irked:   A lot has been said about our new privacy policy. Some have praised us for making our privacy policy easier to understand. Others have asked questions, including members of Congress, and that&apos;s understandable too. We look forward to answering those questions, and clearing up some of the misconceptions about our privacy policies that first appeared in the Washington Post. So, here&apos;s the real story:   Follow the link for the rest. Windows 8 beta: more personalisation coming &gt;&gt; TechRadar  When the Windows 8 beta arrives at the end of February, it will have some widely requested features for killing Metro apps without going to the Task Manager, for navigating using a mouse rather than touch and for doing more with gestures. You&apos;ll also be able to change that overpowering green background. But Windows 8 director of communications Chris Flores points out to TechRadar that you wouldn&apos;t want a photograph as the background of the Metro-style Start screen.   With more details. Larry Page to Googlers: if you don&apos;t get SPYW, work somewhere else &gt;&gt; PandoDaily Sarah Lacy at her new Pando Daily site:   a source tells us that CEO Larry Page, who seems to be hell-bent on competing with Mark Zuckerberg whether it&apos;s the right thing for Google or not, had this to say to employees at a Friday staff event after the Search Plus Your World launch: &quot;This is the path we&apos;re headed down - a single unified, &apos;beautiful&apos; product across everything. If you don&apos;t get that, then you should probably work somewhere else.&quot; The quasi-ultimatum caught our source by surprise and underscores just how important this new direction is for Page. It also helps explain why Google&apos;s PR was so silent since evidence of the Don&apos;t Be Evil toolbar came out yesterday. If this is the future of the company and it flies in the face of Google&apos;s stated values, what can they say?   Google&apos;s PR didn&apos;t respond when we asked for a comment on the &quot;Don&apos;t Be Evil&quot; bookmarklet. It fits.

Microsoft Pulls The Plug On Another Annual Event In Vegas &gt;&gt; Business Insider  Does Microsoft have something against the city of Las Vegas? Late last year, Microsoft announced that 2012 would be its last year keynoting the Consumer Electronics Show, which takes place in Sin City every January. Now, it&apos;s also pulling the plug on MIX, an annual conference for developers that Microsoft has held in Vegas for the last six years. The change probably has nothing to do with the location, and more to do with Microsoft&apos;s shifting priorities. MIX was originally focused on Microsoft&apos;s Web technologies, particularly Silverlight and Internet Explorer.   Which may tell you what you need to know about Silverlight&apos;s future. Google faces Norwegian public sector ban &gt;&gt; FT.com  Norwegian public sector organisations will be banned from using Google Apps after the Norwegian data protection authorities ruled that the service could put citizens&apos; personal data at risk. The data protection authority said Google Apps did not comply with Norwegian privacy laws because there was insufficient information about where data was being kept. The decision came from a test case in Narvik, where the local council had chosen to use Google Apps for their email. The Norwegian ban comes just as things were going so well for Google Apps in Europe, with the company winning its largest ever contract with BBVA, the Spanish bank.   Oh. Well, there go the product placements in Forbrydelsen. Eee Pad Transformer Prime with ICS: a preview of Android 4.0 on a tablet &gt;&gt; The Verge Generally, an improvement in the user interface. But then:   What ICS doesn&apos;t magically change is the selection and quality of the tablet apps available in the Android Market. I have consistently pointed out the lack of tablet-optimized apps in my Honeycomb tablet reviews, and it looks like it will be a complaint that persists. While there have been some notable additions and there are some decent tablet-optimized apps (News360, Plume, and TapTu come to mind), others like Facebook and Twitter haven&apos;t been redesigned to take advantage of the higher resolution screen, making the experience flat-out disappointing.  NEC slashes 10,000 jobs - blames Thai floods, smartphone slump &gt;&gt; Channel Register Dire straits:   The firm did not reveal exactly where in the business the jobs would go, and said the overseas cuts would be made &quot;in accordance with the review of manufacturing operation&quot;. However, its financial forecast document (PDF) reveals some clues.   It shows a Mobile Terminal Business in dire straits, with smartphone shipments revised down for the year from 6.5 million to 5 million units and delays to the expansion of its overseas business. The success of &quot;foreign vendors&apos; increasing market share in Japan&quot; was also noted, no doubt a reference to the huge impact the iPhone has made in the land of the rising sun.   That&apos;s 5m smartphone shipments for the whole year, forecast.  Tablet Display Technology Shoot-Out &gt;&gt; Displaymate The site may hurt your eyes a bit. Persist:   Most people (and reviewers) seem to believe that the 10.1in screens (measured diagonally) on the Android Tablets are larger than the 9.7in iPad screen - but they are actually 5% smaller than the iPad in terms of the image area of the screen, which is what really counts. This is due to both Aspect Ratio geometry (the screen area decreases as the Aspect Ratio increases) and the Android system bar, which reduces the image area.   We had not calculated that before. As a person, publisher, news organization and Twitter user, I think Google&apos;s new personalized search results are AWESOME! &gt;&gt; Thmas Hawk  Earlier this week Twitter put out a statement saying that they thought this new search integration was &quot;bad for people, publishers, news organizations and Twitter users.&quot;   I disagree. Sure, it may be be bad for *Twitter*, but to say it&apos;s bad for people, publishers, news organizations and Twitter users is wrong.

HTC is holding out for a market hero &gt;&gt; Mobile Today HTC is going to focus on &apos;hero&apos; devices, rather than blanketing the market:   The company&apos;s u-turn follows disappointing global results earlier this month when first quarter net profit fell 26% to $365m, its first quarterly decline in earnings for two years as it faced competition from Apple and Samsung&apos;s Galaxy range.   HTC UK chief Phil Roberson (pictured) told Mobile the manufacturer will return to a strategy of launching a limited number of high-spec devices this year, with a focus on second quarter releases. He said: &apos;We have to get back to focusing on what made us great - amazing hardware and a great customer experience. We ended 2011 with far more products than we started out with. We tried to do too much.&quot;   One suspects Samsung will be a large obstacle to heroic ambition. You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard.

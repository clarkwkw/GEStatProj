    "text": "   Joanna Bracken, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    In both an environmental and socioeconomic sense sustainable development aims to create balance between the needs of today with those of tomorrow. Historically &quot;the west&quot; has overexploited nature&apos;s wealth to a significantly greater extent than the developing world, yet our accountability to this and the restoration of past ecosystem damage is largely ignored. Personally I do not see how we can address the needs of today or tomorrow without considering yesterday&apos;s actions. Sustainable development mustn&apos;t shy away from the past and instead should utilise it in achieving a just and equitable balance for future social and environmental needs. The world&apos;s poorest have a greater dependence upon nature&apos;s services, though it is due to the past actions of the world&apos;s richest that this crucial relationship is increasingly threatened. As such the past actions of nations must be considered in discussions and agreements made at Rio+20. It seems entirely reasonable that the greatest commitments to future environmental sustainability should come from those nations that have historically caused the greatest ecosystem damage. As a young member of society, the decisions made at Rio+20 will have great implications for the type of planet that my generation is set to inherit. I am a part of the first generation that is able to see an end to poverty. I hope that at Rio+20 decisions can be made that will compensate for the actions of my ancestors and make this dream a reality. Joanna is a member of a member of UNICEF UK&apos;s On Campus group.",

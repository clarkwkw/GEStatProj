    "text": "Water continued to dominate Global development coverage over the past two weeks as news from the World Water Forum and the alternative forum in Marseille, France, trickled out. We reported on criticism levelled at the ministerial declaration on water policy for its failure to define water and sanitation as human rights. Claire Provost discussed where the line between the technical and political solutions to water challenges is drawn, and, looking ahead to the Rio+20 summit in June, asked whether world leaders would continue to promote top-down, one-size-fits-all approaches to water policy, or whether alternatives proposed by activists would gain traction. Dams were another focus of the two forums. We looked at the new voluntary guidelines introduced to assess the social and environmental impact of dam projects, and highlighted in a gallery some of the world&apos;s most controversial dams. We also looked at the countries that have improved access to safe drinking water. Road safety Guardian Global development has partnered with the Road Safety Fund to report on global road safety. Over the next few months, we will provide coverage from around the world on the dangers people face as car use increases and roads are constructed for speed rather than the needs of pedestrians. Kevin Watkins travelled to Mumbai in India to witness the scale of the problem, and this week he argues that  as traffic injuries rise globally  the Rio+20 summit needs to make road safety the centrepiece of its sustainable transport policy. Meanwhile, in a new video we hear from Anjani Luabar, whose husband was killed in a road accident in 2009, and Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of the Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi. Elsewhere on the site We highlighted two reports published last week by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact. The first warned the UK government that it needed to keep a closer eye on its aid projects in Afghanistan, while the second raised questions over the impact of the much-touted Girl Effect campaign, a joint initiative between the UK&apos;s Department for International Development and the Nike Foundation. We visited a school in Irbid refugee camp in the north of Jordan and discovered the key aspiration for its Palestinian residents is an eventual return to a homeland in Palestine. Phoebe Greenwood reported on plans by Israel to demolish &quot;illegal&quot; solar panels that are the only source of electricity for Palestinians in West Bank villages. Following on from the Kony2012 video that went viral, Les Roopanarine heard from Radhika Coomaraswamy, the UN secretary-general&apos;s special representative for children and armed conflict, who believes the capture of Lord&apos;s Resistance Army rebel Joseph Kony should come second to funding reintegration programmes. Meanwhile, David Smith looked at how the video and the conviction of Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga, in a landmark ruling by the international criminal court, have put the issue of child soldiers back on the global agenda. And we reported on the escalating humanitarian situation in Yemen, where the World Food Programme estimates 5 million people are in need of emergency food aid. Coming up on the site We will look at a new agro-industrial park set to open in Jericho, which aims to bring jobs and money into the West Bank. We will also report on water shortages in Jordan and discuss what can be done to improve access. Jonathan Glennie questions whether sustainable local development is a persuasive alternative to microfinance, while Les Roopanarine looks at some of the success stories and discusses whether they trump academic theories that doubt the impact of microfinance. And look out for our podcast on how we can tackle global poverty, recorded at the Guardian&apos;s Open weekend. Multimedia Video: Communities fear arrival of Uganda&apos;s oil sector New contracts between the Ugandan government and a UK-listed oil company will speed up development in the country&apos;s oil sector. But communities in the oil-rich west fear the industry could mean they are displaced from their land without proper compensation. Audio slideshow: Sahel food crisis  Chadian women describe the hardships they face Chadian women in the Bahr-el-Ghazal and Guera provinces speak about the poor harvest over the past few years and the difficulties they have in feeding their children.

What you said: some of the best comments from our readers social1entrepreneur agreed with Jonathan Glennie that NGOs need to collaborate more, arguing:  Having worked in a grant-making role I used to find it frustrating that every NGO claimed to be the best at everything. Organisations would benefit from being clearer and more focused about what their core expertise is, leveraging that and then partnering with others when different skill sets are needed.  Mtega had a good debate with Claire Provost on water privatisation, saying:  If market forces are left alone to deliver water, the rich get better services and prices go up. But if utilities are kept in public hands, they get trapped in a cycle of bad management and bailouts. In both cases, expansion of distribution networks is rare and those without network connections continue to go without.  Moonie73 shared some personal experiences of African roads on Kevin Watkins&apos; road safety blog, writing:  It seems solutions needn&apos;t cost the earth, just some creativity. I have seen some partial solutions. Ouagadougou, for example, has almost Dutch-style lanes for bicycles and mopeds  it was wonderful to see. This is by contrast with Nairobi, where getting on a bicycle is akin to Russian roulette.  Highlights from the blogosphere On Duncan Green&apos;s blog From Poverty to Power, Erinch Sahan looks at Oxfam livelihood projects and shares his thoughts on how to create the right economic opportunities for poor people. The World Bank&apos;s Wolfgang Fengler asks why Kenya, with all its beauty, is losing ground to other countries when it comes to tourism. Meanwhile, Nancy Birdsall, from the Centre for Global Development, suggests three questions we should be asking the candidates hoping to lead the World Bank. And finally  The Poverty matters newsletter will be back in two weeks with another round-up of the latest news and comment.

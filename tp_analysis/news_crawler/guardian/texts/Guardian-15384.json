    "text": "We&apos;re off to see my mum. &quot;Navigate to Dorchester-on-Thames,&quot; Icommand, to test out the state-of-the-art, voice-activated satnav. &quot;Navigate to the nearest mountain pass  is that correct?&quot; the car says. What? No! Dorchester-on-Thames. Itry again. &quot;Navigate to the nearest government office?&quot; Maybe Mum&apos;s village is too small. Let&apos;s try Oxford  surely Mazda&apos;s heard of that. &quot;Navigate to the nearest opera  is that correct?&quot; Now, it&apos;s possible I&apos;m doing something wrong, that I&apos;ve got it set to points of interest instead of towns. But even so, there&apos;s something very stupid about it. I mean, who, while driving along, will suddenly decide they fancy taking in an opera  it doesn&apos;t matter which is the closest  and make a detour on the off-chance there&apos;s something on? Likewise mountain pass and government office (unless you&apos;re contemplating suicide or terrorism, respectively). Later, when I ask to be taken to the village of Ewelme, the car says,&quot;Navigate to the nearest school  is that correct?&quot; No! Because if it was to collect my children, I would know where their school was. But just the nearest school? Well, if this Mazda was an ice-cream van, it might just be acceptable. But it&apos;s not. So maybe it&apos;s a car for an opportunistic drug dealer or  lordy  something dodgier still. Mazda may disagree. They&apos;d say the new mid-size family car is much improved over the previous model  lighter, roomier, more economical, prettier, and serious competition for not just Mondeos and Insignias, but also more prestigious German rivals. They&apos;d be right. It&apos;s hard to find fault with (though equally hard to fall in love with). The numbers  money, performance, consumption, emissions  are excellent, the sort to make a fleet manager a little bit excited. It is handsome, too, in an unremarkable kind of way. The diesel is refined to the pointthat you hardly notice it&apos;s adiesel, yetit responds almost pleasingly toright-foot pressure. Driving, though not thrilling, is certainly nochore: it&apos;s almost litheand feels smaller than it is, except inside, where it&apos;s well-equipped and comfortable, with room for Mum tostretch out her legs in the back. Plus a cavernous boot, tostash drugs. OK, I give in: we&apos;ll go to the nearest school, which, the car says after a quick calculation, is 15 miles away and will take half an hour. Wrong, Mum says from the back. There&apos;s one just up the road, in Ewelme as it happens. A famous medieval one, founded in 1437 Yeah, all right, Mum, this is a car review, not a bloody history lesson.

    "text": "Having taught in comprehensive schools for more than 30 years, I should like to take issue with Suzanne Moore&apos;s views on school uniform (G2, 30 August). She seems to think uniform is part of a sinister plot to turn every pupil into a brainwashed brick in the capitalist edifice. Yes, blazers and ties are associated with private schools, yacht clubs and other centres of middle-class self-congratulation; but they are also associated with certain attitudes and values  self-restraint, politeness, respect for others et alia, which we should, arguably, be encouraging in young people of all classes and backgrounds. And uniform avoids the endless pitfalls of a clothing free-for-all. When I taught in a school without a uniform policy, girls would compete fiercely with each other for the attention of boys: short skirts, low-cut tops, lipstick, large circular ear-rings that looked like parrot perches  you name it, they wore it. Ms Moore&apos;s view that in schools without a uniform policy pupils will still compete to outdo each other with &quot;signifiers of class and money&quot; such as bags and pens is not borne out by my own experience: I have often been asked to adjudicate on who has the best trainers or best leather jacket, but never on bags or pens  they are totally irrelevant to the hierarchy of teenage cool. And the idea that wearing a uniform will undermine pupils&apos; readiness to ask questions about the society they are growing up in is, again, totally at odds with my own experience. If Ms Moore thinks that wearing school uniform constrains independence of thought, what is her attitude to pupils wearing, say, a headscarf? The apparel oft proclaims the man, but not always.A BentleyGrainthorpe, Lincolnshire",

    "text": "Widespread protests in India followed the gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus, putting the country&apos;s record on tackling gender violence in the spotlight and giving global prominence to an often sidelined &quot;women&apos;s&quot; issue. The attack, in December, led to a tightening of legislation on sexual assault in India. But will legal changes and tougher punishments for perpetrators change people&apos;s attitudes to violence? Many countries have laws outlawing rape and assault, but traditional attitudes about women and towards sexual violence often undermine legal processes and prevent people from reporting crimes. For example, Afghanistan&apos;s constitution offers protection to women, yet domestic violence, sexual harassment and trafficking are common. Such behaviour is often considered a family matter, dealt with through the country&apos;s informal justice systems, largely composed of male elders, making it difficult for women to speak out. Although South Africa has a progressive constitution that enshrines women&apos;s rights, the gang rape of a girl with disabilities in South Africa last year highlighted a continued ambivalence towards gender violence. In Somalia, a woman who reported a rape was jailed for a year, along with the journalists who interviewed her. Statistics on gender violence are stark. In 2003, the UN said worldwide one in three women will be raped or beaten in her lifetime. Up to 140 million women and children are living with the effects of female genital mutilation. Women are more at risk in conflict situations where sexual violence is used as a weapon of war. Violence can result in physical, mental and reproductive health problems, including increased vulnerability to HIV, and is a violation of human rights. In March the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) will discuss the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls. The issue is a priority under the UK&apos;s leadership of the G8 this year. But how effective are global high-level meetings at tackling the problem? Can they be effective or does grassroots community work hold the key? How can women feel able to access justice? Can mass campaigns, like Thursday&apos;s One Billion Rising, help to bridge the global and community divide? We will be discussing these issues in February&apos;s podcast. Liz Ford, the Guardian Global development&apos;s deputy editor, will chair the discussion and be joined down the line from Rome by Irene Khan, director of the International Development Law Organisation, which recently released a report advocating radical legal empowerment for women, and from Monrovia by Korto Williams, director of ActionAid Liberia, who will talk about her work tackling the root causes of sexual violence. We&apos;ll also hear from Lakshmi Puri, deputy executive director of UN Women, and Professor Gita Sen, from the Institute of Management in Bangalore, who writes extensively on women&apos;s issues. We also hope Britain&apos;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which last year launched its prevention of sexual violence in conflict initiative, will join the debate. We want to hear from you. What questions do you have for the panellists? What&apos;s at stake at CSW? How can we prevent gender based violence? Are community-based solutions the best way to tackle the problem? Can traditional laws be used to bring long-term solutions? And will you be taking part in One Billion Rising? Post your questions for the podcast in the thread below.

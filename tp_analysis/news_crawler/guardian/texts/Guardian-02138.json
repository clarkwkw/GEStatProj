Last week, I showed you a short video that discusses happy numbers, a concept that ties in with an earlier video I shared about narcissistic numbers. But what do these concepts have to do with what mathematicians do when they visit the pub?   In this video, we continue the discussion about happy numbers when we go on a mathematical tour through a &quot;happification tree&quot;, meeting a few narcissistic numbers along the way, and discover another mathematically-derived structure, dubbed the &quot;melancoil&quot; by today&apos;s presenter, Matt;             Visit numberphile&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].  So what is the answer to the question I originally posed?  What do narcissistic numbers and happy numbers share with the wild events that transpire when mathematicians visit the pub?  Fruitless loops!  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  Numberphile is another of many video projects by video journalist Brady Haran. Numberphile is on facebook and on twitter @numberphile In this video, we met Matt Parker, a highly enthusiastic mathematician whose goal is to make people more excited about maths. He writes the website, Stand-up Mathematician.  Those of you who live in or visit London may recognise this location. It&apos;s the Champagne Bar at St Pancras railway station!  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientistemail: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

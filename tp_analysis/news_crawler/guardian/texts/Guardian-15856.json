    "text": "The recent safe rescue of a walker whose leg had been trapped beneath a boulder on a Lakeland fell shows the advances that have been made in mountain rescue, no matter how wild and desolate the terrain. Five crew members from Coniston Mountain Rescue Team reached the woman after being airlifted on to the summit ridge by a Great North Air Ambulance helicopter above Low Water tarn. From this vertiginous position perched above Coppermines Valley, the crew managed to get down to the casualty and treat her injuries, before an RAF Sea King winched her from the mountainside and flew her to Lancaster Royal Infirmary. There was no such help for Cornelius Crump, a stockbroker&apos;s clerk from London, who fell into the precipitous depths of Piers Gill on a June morning 92 years ago. Crump lost his footing as he descended the steep route from Scafell Pike to Sty Head in mist, and languished with a broken leg for 17 days, eking out sandwiches and bits of chocolate. His plight was exacerbated by a chockstone bridging the gorge overhead and partly hiding him from view. Several times Crump heard voices but his cries went unheard. Barely alive, he was eventually spotted by three climbers who had set out to pioneer a first descent of Piers Gill. The mile-long ravine normally rushing with waterfalls that feed Wastwater had been made less treacherous by the extraordinary drought of 1921. Despite the odds, there would seem a far greater chance of Crump being rescued today. He would probably be carrying a mobile phone and hopefully able to receive a signal, so he could at least send an SOS by text. His sister in Ulverston, with whom he was staying, would no doubt have raised the alarm, and there&apos;s every chance he would then would have been located once rescuers knew he had intended to walk the 12 miles from Coniston to Buttermere. Casualties are found on the strength of scantier details, even when, like Crump, they lose their way.",

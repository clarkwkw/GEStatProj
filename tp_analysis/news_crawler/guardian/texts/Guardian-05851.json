    "text": "Running outdoors is low impact and connects you with nature  both gold-star ethical activities. And yet the history of athletic shoes and the industry&apos;s business model mean that when you try and select asuitable shoe you enter a vortex of exploitation issues. Yue Yuen, the planet&apos;s biggest trainer manufacturer and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) for Nike, Adidas, New Balance, Puma, Reebok and others, has pushed out 83.4m pairs in the past three months alone. But deconstruct the retail price (as Consumer International did in 2009) and you&apos;ll see that although the 150 processes needed to create atrainer make them one of the most labour-intensive items we own, just 0.4% of retail cost is spent on labour. Some companies produce ethical trainers. There&apos;s Veja (veja.fr), which sources fairtrade components, the Ethletic shoe (thefaircorp.com), and Dutch ethical brand Isyou.com is working on a &quot;unique sneaker&quot; model, with shoes to be co-designed in developing nations with everyone involved receiving a fair share of proceeds. Sadly they don&apos;t produce proper running shoes. So who leads the race for most sustainable performance shoes? The Running Costs report noted &quot;progress in improving social conditions within factories&quot; from Reebok, Puma, Adidas and New Balance. Also, after a 2009 Greenpeace report on the leather industry implicated major trainer brands in Amazonian deforestation, they signed up for sourcing leather more carefully. The biggest strides have been in making the product greener (easier than tackling social issues). Trainers are made from about 50 components, including plastic foams, solvents and metallic fabrics  all with the potential to be highly polluting. Nike has led on reducing emissions and waste, but Puma is also improving its efforts by publishing an eco profit-and-loss account. Saucony has earned the unofficial soubriquet of &quot;running shoes that Thom Yorke doesn&apos;t hate&quot; with its supply-chain transparency and support of &quot;slow fashion&quot;: it brings out new designs only a couple of times a year as opposed to the turbo-charged brands that bring out anew model every six weeks. As an alternative, barefoot shoes, such as Vivobarefoot Evo and New Balance&apos;s Minimus, are going one step further and moving towards getting rid of trainers. It&apos;s one way to give the big brands a kicking. Green crush of the week AJ Moore hails from Carlisle, is classically trained and has played with many seminal UK bands in the past decade. He&apos;s the musician&apos;s musician, and his love of music is closely followed by conservation. Among his more unusual gigs was one for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature at the Copenhagen climate summit COP15. That experience, along with a deep reverence for David Attenborough, has set the tone for his new single, &quot;Take it All Away&quot;, an anthem for doomed species. Proceeds will go to conservation charities nominated by Attenborough himself.",

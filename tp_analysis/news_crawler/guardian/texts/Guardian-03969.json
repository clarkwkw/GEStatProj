    "text": "This Friday between 1-2pm BST we&apos;re joined by Thiemo Gropp, the co-founder and director of the Desertec Foundation, to answer your questions on the ambitious project to link up Europe and North Africa&apos;s green energy resources. The Desertec projects operates on the theory of comparative advantage: certain renewable energy technologies are more suited to different parts of the world. It wants different parts of the world to exploit their natural advantage in biomass or solar, wind, and hydro power, and then link up on an interconnected grid. The first phase of the 400bn German-led project is under way in Morocco and aims to provide provide 15% of Europe&apos;s electricity by 2050 through a vast network of solar and wind farms. Eventually the project hopes to expand into the world&apos;s deserts. Is the project revolutionary, or too idealistic? It also depends on a high level of co-operation between governments, some of which are currently unstable and others that might typically clash. Do you think they could work together on alternative energy? Whatever you want to ask about Desertec, just post your questions below.",

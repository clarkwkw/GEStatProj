    "text": "Along with LittleBigPlanet developer Media Molecule, thatgamecompany is one of the best examples of Sony&apos;s willingness to invest in new ideas. It&apos;s a studio focussed on making games that resonate emotionally, drawing on its staff&apos;s background in multimedia art. So far the studio has made Cloud, flOw and Flower: Cloud is a wonderfully relaxing flight through blue skies and drifting cumulus; flOw lets you be a micro-organism in the primordial ooze, munching others as you float; Flower is a gorgeous if rather heavy-handed meditation on the relationship between the urban and the natural in which you literally play a cloud of petals. They are beautiful, whimsical creations, but they have always stopped short of profundity. These are all games that have tried to push the boundaries of what interactive entertainment can express, but Journey tries harder  and Journey succeeds. Journey is profound, or at least it can be. The studio describes it as an interactive parable, the story of a lone traveller and their path through life told in the form of a voyage that starts in the vast expanses of a desert and ends  well, to tell you how it ends would spoil it. You think you know what Journey is going to be about after the first five minutes, but you don&apos;t. I came to it expecting something charming, visually stunning and perhaps even mildly edifying. I left thinking that it may well be, in many ways, the best video game I have ever played. You play a traveller swaddled in red robes, beginning atop a desert sand dune with a view of a shining mountain on the horizon. You&apos;re given no direction; instead you&apos;re guided by the natural impulse to move towards that looming, distant beacon. Control is intentionally simple and unobtrusive; you can only walk, jump and sing, but Journey still crafts some astounding scenarios from those bare gameplay ingredients. It has you surfing down sand dunes in the fading light, scaling towers, flying on the wind and cowering in underground ruins as you slowly uncover what could have happened to the civilisation that must have once lived there. It&apos;s steeped in vague religious imagery; shrines, billowing robes, a solitary desert setting that can&apos;t help but evoke the Old Testament from time to time. Gentle puzzles and hidden scraps of material that extend your fluttering scarf and let you stay airborne for longer provide the only traditional gameplay elements to be found in this adventure. Instead, the enjoyment comes from inhabiting and admiring its world. You will rarely play a game that makes you feel so much like you&apos;re actually there as Journey does. There is not the slightest inconsistency in its art direction, and this, together with extremely clever sound design and natural signposting, absorbs you in the game&apos;s world entirely. High dunes act as boundaries, and your eye is always instinctively drawn towards where you&apos;re supposed to be headed next, whether through lighting, camera direction or. At no point was I pulled out of Journey&apos;s world through clumsy design or a single frame of unnatural animation.     Journey PS3 game    It helps that Journey doesn&apos;t overstretch itself; it&apos;s about 90 minutes long, which is enough time to get you absorbed in its premise but not enough time for you to start questioning the substance behind its beauty. A lack of nuanced gameplay mechanics is hardly a problem for a game of this length. But the thing that really energises Journey, the thing that makes you want to play it through over and over again, is that you don&apos;t play it alone. From time to time, you&apos;ll see another traveller huddled down into their robes just off in the distance. Journey has ambient multiplayer that drops people into your game from time to time. You can either interact with them  by singing, or running around in circles together, by sticking with each other through to the game&apos;s conclusion and supporting each other  or leave them be to wander off into the sands again. Journey&apos;s emotional impact, which is not inconsiderable when playing along, is multiplied exponentially by sharing the experience with a stranger. It manages more meaningful communication with one button than most can with endless text and voice. There are probably some players for who the trick won&apos;t work, and for who this journey will be a beautiful but ultimately hollow one  aesthetically stunning, but perhaps not meaningful. For me, though, Journey has moved me as much as any other piece of art or entertainment has. Journey&apos;s visual and sound design sets new standards for interactive entertainment. This alone makes it an extraordinary work, but it&apos;s the way that these aesthetic elements come together with beautifully subtle direction and storytelling to create a lasting emotional effect that elevates this to one of the very best games of our time.

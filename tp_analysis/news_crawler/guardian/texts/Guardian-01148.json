    "text": "More than 100 secondary schools face being closed and reopened as academies for failing to meet government targets (Report, 27 January). Yet of the 200 schools with the lowest percentage of pupils achieving five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, 53 are academies. The worst performing school is an academy in Poole, which managed to reduce the percentage of pupils achieving the standard from 21% for its predecessor school, to 3% now. Of the 200 best performers, only one is an academy. The government&apos;s own data would appear to indicate that the policy of forcing failing schools to become academies is a recipe for failure.Paul DennehyEnfield, Middlesex   Whether or not you agree with the methods used to judge schools&apos; performance, the latest figures show  contrary to recent opinion (Gove condemns academy critics as &apos;ideologues&apos; who embrace failure, 5 January)  that schools in Haringey are improving and at a faster rate than the country as a whole. Across the borough there has been a 9.3% rise since 2010 in the proportion of students attaining five or more A* to C grades, including English and maths. This means results in Haringey have improved by 15.2% since 2008, compared with a national rise of 10.7%. We believe close, local collaboration and strong working relationships with schools will best support and improve educational outcomes for all young people, including the most vulnerable. A quarter of all primary and a third of all secondary schools in Haringey are currently judged to be outstanding by Ofsted.Cllr Lorna ReithCabinet member for children, Haringey council",

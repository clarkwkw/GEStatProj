    "text": "This winter has done some amazing somersaults. Spring flowers came out in January&apos;s warm breezes, only to be caught out by the Arctic freeze this month, before last week&apos;s burst of warm weather brought out crocuses and many other bulb flowers again. These plants are fairly resilient to cold because they originally came from the mountains of central and eastern Europe, where they can flower with snow still lying on the ground. Native British flowers are also coming out, such as the golden yellow lesser celandine, one of the first woodland flowers of the year. And trees have bounced back from the freeze as well. One of the most exquisite sights is the little flower of witch hazel, its cluster of bright yellow ribbon petals looking like tiny sea anemones strewn along the twigs. The name &quot;witch&quot; actually comes from the old word for bendable, because early American colonists saw native Indians use the twigs as divining rods to find water by watching them bend. Witch hazel is better known for healing cuts and sores, and for skin complaints such as acne. Witch hazel is entirely different from our native hazel, though. The lambs&apos; tail catkins of hazel are well and truly out now, dancing in the wind as they dangle down from twigs and shedding pollen onto the tiny red female flowers. Hazel is also tolerant of the cold, and was one of the first trees to return to Britain after the last ice age.",

    "text": "Standpipes might be needed in the streets in parts of England next year if the country has its third dry winter in a row, the environment secretary has warned. Millions of consumers already facing hosepipe bans and warnings to save water were given the grim news as Caroline Spelman insisted the present &quot;temporary restrictions&quot; on non-essential use were designed to ensure &quot;we don&apos;t have to move to more stringent restrictions later&quot;. But she told the BBC&apos;s Inside Out programme, to be screened on Wednesday night: &quot;Whereas it&apos;s most unlikely we would have standpipes this year, if we have another dry winter that becomes more likely.&quot; Spelman&apos;s warning, coming after the wettest April on record and warnings of more heavy, thundery rain on the way for southern England and Wales, reinforces the message from water companies that they will be unlikely to lift the hosepipe bans any time soon. Seventeen counties are already under water restrictions and experts say groundwater levels are still low. Spelman accepted the government needed to do more to make water companies reduce leakage and said councils would have to consider whether new developments could be supplied with water when making planning decisions. &quot;We need to look at a whole range of ways in which we can help to reduce demand for water and become more water-efficient. One of the questions which has to be in councillors&apos; minds is: do we have enough water to supply this new development?&quot; On Wednesday morning, 24 flood warnings, where floods were expected, were in force. There were 102 flood alerts, where flooding was possible, according to the Environment Agency.",

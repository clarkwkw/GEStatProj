    "text": "When Nintendo makes a game based on a real sport, it usually gives the company&apos;s iconic plumber the helm, and as an expert crafter of fantasy and good cheer, naturally he is on court for Mario Tennis Open. The courts are splashed with brilliant colours, players plucked from a cast of classic Nintendo characters, with rackets that possess special abilities. Yet in spite of all the excess, at its core the game does capture a little of the basis of tennis. While it is a universe away from being a simulator, Nintendo&apos;s creation succeeds in delivering some sense of the pace and strategy of the game. On the downside, there&apos;s little here in terms of modes and extras beyond the tennis, and the touch-screen controls are less than intuitive, but some fine button controls, a smattering of enjoyable minigames and impressive AI in the doubles matches do much to redeem the shortcomings.",

    "text": "Would getting involved in student politics help me with a political career in the real world?  Alex Mawby, Nottingham  It wouldn&apos;t hurt. For a start, the skills you&apos;ll learn  fighting elections, speech-making, policy creation  will inevitably help you win that coveted council seat in Kidderminster in three years&apos; time. Take Wes Streeting. NUS president in 2010, Streeting is now a councillor in east London. Then there&apos;s the networking: many student groups  particularly those on the left, such as Labour Students  have strong links with politicians, and have historically been a springboard for higher office. By aligning the NUS with Blairite policies, Jim Murphy, NUS president in 1996, so ingratiated himself with the Labour party that he was a Labour MP by 1997. Is student politics just about the student union?  Anon No. The student union which campaigns on behalf of students, and often organises social events  is the most obvious (and influential) manifestation of student politics. But it&apos;s also bureaucratic  boring, say some  and popular mainly with people from the centre-left. That&apos;s too lefty for most Tories, who tend to prefer the debating societies (often called unions, confusingly) or the port-and-cheese evenings at the uni&apos;s Conservative association. Conversely, those on the far-left think the students unions aren&apos;t radical enough. They get their kicks instead from occupations, or from anti-fees groups such as Education Not for Sale or the NationalCampaign Against Fees andCuts.  How leftwing is student politics?  Tom Meaden, LSE It depends on where you are, and who happens to be leading the student union at the time. Imperial&apos;s student union is notoriously rightwing, and even spoke out in favour of tuition fees. By contrast, the unions at Sussex and Essex are traditionally further to the left, and quicker to support hard-left occupations. Certainly, student politics is slightly further to the left than it was a decade ago: the occupations and marches against fee hikes has dragged universities such as Cambridge leftwards. But things change from year to year. At the height of the fees fight, the University of London Union elected socialist Clare Solomon president. A year later, she was ousted by Vraj Domalip, who first got involved in student politics through the support of his rowing club  a reminder that many student politicians hail from quite apoliticalroots. What are the essential things to know when going on your first studentprotest? Anon First: the next big one&apos;s on 21November. Second: it may not achieve much, sadly. When the government floated a bill to raise tuition fees in late 2010, thousands of students marched on a weekly basis, trashed Tory HQ and rioted in Parliament Square. The bill still passed. Third: the police may get violent. If that&apos;s not your thing, stay away from the riot cops (easier said than done, mind) and from the protesters who look as if they&apos;re up for a tussle. If you&apos;re stopped by the police, you don&apos;t have to identify yourself unless you&apos;re actually arrested. Peaceful protest is perfectly legal. If you do get arrested (which can happen to anyone), say nothing, certainly don&apos;t swear, and do call Bindmans  solicitors specialising in protest  on 020-7833 4433. Why is it that if you went to a boarding school you are assumed to support foxhunting?  Tom Meaden, LSE Because all boarding schools require their lads to kill at least one fox before tuck. Right?

    "text": "The number of students dropping out of university has fallen steeply, official figures show, possibly because young people are trying to protect themselves from a fiercely competitive job market. The most recent statistics  from 2010-11  show 7.4% of full-time undergraduates quit their degrees within a year of starting their courses. The previous year, the figure was 8.6%. However, there is a wide discrepancy between universities. At the University of the West of Scotland, the drop-out rate was 23%, while at London Metropolitan it was 16.6%. At Cambridge, it was 1.3% and at Oxford and Exeter, it was 1.7%. Dr Emma Tominey, a lecturer in economics at the University of York, said the lower drop-out rate could be due to students being wary of the job market. &quot;It is hard enough for a graduate to get a job,&quot; she said. &quot;It is even harder if you have dropped out of university.&quot; She added that those who entered the job market during a recession tended to have lower wages and more job insecurity throughout their careers. Prof Les Ebdon, the government&apos;s university access tsar, said universities and colleges were working harder to ensure students completed their studies. &quot;It is encouraging to see that rates of retention are already moving in the right direction,&quot; he said.",

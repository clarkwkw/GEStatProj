    "text": "David Cameron must urgently address the serious issues raised by your report (Tory&apos;s plot to back anti-wind rival in byelection, 14 November) and the threat it poses to his promise to lead the greenest government ever. Is the chancellor involved with anti-green fringe elements of the Conservative party in attempts to undermine the UK&apos;s Climate Change Act? Mr Cameron must find out and make it clear that this ground-breaking climate law  for which he prominently campaigned  is here to stay. He must also stop John Hayes from constantly undermining business confidence in clean energy. Every time the energy minister decries renewable power, it costs UK jobs and makes the transition to a low-carbon future more expensive and difficult to achieve. The prime minister must act swiftly to prevent a small group of maverick MPs from wrecking plans to develop a green economy and the tens of thousands of jobs this will create.

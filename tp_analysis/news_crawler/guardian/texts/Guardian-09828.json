    "text": "Arguing about sciencewith Simon Jenkins is like trying to wrestle with a fart  you can&apos;t miss the odious stink but there&apos;s almost nothing to get hold of. His recentopinion piece in the Guardianabout Italian seismologists being sent to jail for failing to properly inform the people of L&apos;Aquila in 2009 about the risks of a major earthquake blew up into a now familiar diatribe against the elevated status he believes science has claimed for itself.  &quot;Science has rarely enjoyed greater status. Schools are in thrall to it. Broadcasters grovel at its feet, with hours of programmes devoted to children gazing adoringly at scientific researchers, depicted as funny, garrulous, lovable role models. Science has taken the place of religion in a cocoon of uncritical certainty. Those who claim the title &quot;scientist&quot;, be it natural or social, expect to combine the immunity of diplomats and the infallibility of popes. Science is merging into scientology.&quot;  There is so much wrong with that paragraph it is difficult to know where to start. In the article Jenkins also wrongly conflates the technical responsibilities of a cook or an engineer with those of scientists charged to predict the behaviour of systems that science readily acknowledges it does not fully understand. Neither does he pause to consider what is properly meant by risk or probability. Finally, he reserves his greatest ire for meteorologists:  &quot;The gloomy Met Office, seemingly in the pay of the outbound tourism trade, is reckless with other people&apos;s livelihoods.&quot;  Jenkins has the presence of mind to include the word &apos;seemingly&apos; in that sentence, so as to avoid being sued for libel. But in doing so he reveals he has no evidence that the Met Office has been bribed by nefarious tour operators. And so his argument evaporates in a puff of malodorous smoke. The carelessness with which he lays out his case, and the lack of any compelling detail, suggests that it is in fact Jenkins who considers himself incapable of error, at least when he is writing about science. The first time I reacted to one of his articles, I tried to do sowith reasoned argument; the second timeI went for mockery. Neither approach seemed to have any effect.However, I am a flawed, fallible scientist  my initial reaction on Twitterto his piece was angry and, I have to confess, hardly constructive  so although I failed the first time, I would like to give reasoned argument another go. I don&apos;t find it easy to penetrate the haze of Jenkins&apos; anger with science and scientists. It drove his argument almost to incoherence. He wants scientists to be held to account but somehow also felt that making the Italian seismologists stand trial and face prison for their failings was inappropriate. His conflicting stance hinted at the real complexity of the issue but he opted not to engage with it. The difficulty as far as I can see it is that Jenkins hasn&apos;t tried very hard to understand either the particular court case that concluded in Italy with a conviction last week or the varied reactions of the scientific community. He has overlooked, for example, this 2011 article in Nature that not only explained the detailedbackground to the charges brought against the Italian scientists but also reported comments from other scientists such as Thomas Jordan, an American seismologist, who was critical of the way that the scientists on the commission communicated risk to the local population in L&apos;Aquila. This thoughtful analysis from volcanologist Willy Aspinall, also from Nature in 2011, would have shown Jenkins the falsity of his claim that waving a banknote is enough to deflect the considered views of any pundit. But the most annoying thing about Jenkins&apos;s piece is that he has a point. It might have been difficult to spot in the midst of his bilious rant but the scientific community needs to be careful in presenting commentary  and recommendations  on matters of serious public interest. The Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences did us no favours by issuing a curt statement that simply condemned the decision of the Italian court. There was no critical assessment of the particular actions of the scientists that had raised the concerns of the people of L&apos;Aquila. The absence of nuance failed to reflect the realities of the case and shaded into an arrogance that served neither the public nor the scientific community. This would be grist to the Jenkins mill were it not for the fact that neither the Royal Society nor the US National Academy properly represents the views of scientists. It needs to be borne in mind, on all sides, that the scientific community is far from homogenous, so a parade of caricatures in newspaper opinion pieces serves little good. Nor does a knee jerk reaction to such opinion. Fortunately, against the brief statement from science&apos;s grandees we can place much more considered analyses from the likes of social scientistBrigitte Nerlich, statisticianDavid Spiegelhalter, and seismologist Austin Elliot(the latter&apos;s analysis is particularly good). If scientists are ever to win round the likes of Simon Jenkins  and I suggest we keep trying we have to put away the indignation and find ways of conversing with him. Let&apos;s start with courtesy, and discussion of the evidence.",

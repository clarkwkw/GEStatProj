    "text": "It is fitting, perhaps, that Metal Gear Rising should be subtitled with a neologism. The game is something of a novelty itself  a new kind of construct, one fashioned from a blend of alien ingredients. Hideo Kojima&apos;s long-running series has always been a game of military hide-and-seek: creeping in khaki, sneaking with silencers. Sure, the tense scuttles past armed guards under a roomy cardboard box are usually followed by a soliloquy on the nature of contemporary warfare, but Metal Gear&apos;s quiddity was always to be found in its shadows. The Osaka-based Platinum Games  creators of Metal Gear Rising  by contrast, is a video game developer known principally for its swagger and volume. If not the greatest Japanese developer at work today, Platinum is certainly the most creatively boisterous, hurling explosive titles such as Vanquish and Bayonetta out of the door to enthral players and disrupt rivals with their noise and muscle. If Metal Gear neutralises its foe with a sleep dart fired from a darkened air vent slit, Platinum Games rides into the mess hall on an armoured stallion wielding a readied bazooka on each shoulder like a vision plucked from a Michael Bay cheese dream. Bring the two outfits together into a single game and you&apos;re guaranteed a neologism. In any creative marriage of this sort, it&apos;s important to understand what each party brings to the banquet. Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is a Platinum game dressed in Metal Gear&apos;s garb, which is to say it&apos;s a game that prioritises spectacle over stealth, hurled one-liners over hushed codec comms and death by katana cleave over a chloroform choke. You assume control of Raiden, the protagonist from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (petulant, weedy) that nobody wanted to play and the supporting character from Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (determined, cyborg ninja) that everybody wanted to play. Raiden may not have the gruff, stubbly charm of series poster man Solid Snake, but he&apos;s a solid choice for this role: lithe, quick and with a determined steel jawbone.     Metal Gear Rising Revengeance: the cyborg ninja    Where Metal Gear Solid 4 was characterised by Solid Snake&apos;s old age, Raiden&apos;s youth and agility infuses every aspect of Rising, where the props and trappings of the Kojima&apos;s myth are presented with a light touch. There are none of the drawn out cut scenes and conversations of the mainline Metal Gears. Communications still arrive via the earpiece codec, but they are short and pointed. Mei Ling-esque esoteric philosophising is entirely absent, for example. What the dialogue loses in verbosity and lyricism (&quot;What do you want with the president?&quot; &quot;I want him  dead.&quot;) it makes up for in brevity (and the odd peculiar idiolect). The cardboard box makes a return but it&apos;s a visual quip more than a serious asset in the arsenal, wobbling precariously as Raiden hunch-runs behind enemies he&apos;d far rather be chopping into segments than squeezing past. This swordplay is at the heart of the game&apos;s interactive toolkit. While running in his &quot;Ninja Dash&quot; (a high speed take on Assassin&apos;s Creed&apos;s one-touch parkour routine) Raiden will gracefully deflect incoming bullets with his blade, allowing him to streak up to any antagonising cybernetic soldier and engage in hand-to-hand martial combat. In close quarters, a squeeze of the left bumper sends Raiden into Blade Mode. Here time is slowed while your right thumbstick rotates a plane that passes through the centre of the screen. Release the thumbstick and Raiden performs a sword strike along its path. In this way its possible to slice and dice enemies (and many inanimate objects) while an on-screen &quot;combat log&quot; keeps track of the number of disparate &quot;parts&quot; that your handiwork has created. In order to temper its use, Blade Mode drains the Raiden suit&apos;s energy, which will replenish slowly or which can be refilled by attacking enemies  a design that naturally favours offensive play.     Metal Gear Rising Revengeance: features Blade Mode    Activate Blade Mode with maximised fuel cells and you will trigger Zandatsu a technique that automatically analyses the ideal cutting position on any given foe. Slice the red indicator box and you can seize your foe&apos;s self-repair unit, defeating the enemy in a single swipe while also fully refilling your fuel cell and life bar. In order to discourage button-mashing, enemies flash red just before they attack, inviting a parry. If you&apos;re alert you&apos;ll suffer only a slight knockback, while a perfectly timed deflection will stun the enemy for the prescient player. Each of the game&apos;s stages is broken into smaller segments, with a Vanquish-style score sheet rating your performance at each conclusion, summarised by a final alphabetical &quot;combat rank&quot; up to the faultless &quot;S&quot; grade. A sub-weapon slot allows you to engage with distinct targets using rocket launchers and grenades. Nevertheless, Platinum ensures that even remote battles with helicopters end with the appropriate ceremony, inviting the agile protagonist to skip along the tops of incoming rockets before slicing the chopper into Teflon shards as a fitting end to a sky battle. No matter how you dispatch of them, defeated foes drop BP, the game&apos;s currency which can be spent on a huge array of different customisation options for upgrading Raiden&apos;s suit, weapons and abilities, increasing the range and spectacle of every battle.     Metal Gear Rising Revengeance: a VR mission    VR missions  a feature of the original Metal Gear Solid  take Raiden into a Game Boy-green virtual training dimension, with 20 timed challenges to complete in which you must, for example, rush past enemy soldiers to reach the exit point in as short a time as possible, or throw armfuls of grenades at moving targets. New missions are unlocked by finding the relevant suitcase pick-up over the course of the storyline and provide a competitive change of pace away from the pocked African streets on the main game. Rowdy, animated and exhaustingly vigorous, Metal Gear Rising is a game that retains the capacity for stealth, but actively encourages players to rush in, katana blazing. The Metal Gear myth has never before appeared so agile, fresh and youthful, but more than the setting its Platinum&apos;s virtuoso coders that shine throughout, the object slicing a marvel of high-speed 3D manipulation. A technical masterpiece, Rising offers a funfair ride approximation of Konami&apos;s brooding series, but one with more than enough capacity for the Bayonetta veteran to express their dexterous expertise.

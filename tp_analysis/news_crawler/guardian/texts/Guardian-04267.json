Canon EOS 7D, 400 mm f/6.3 at 1/200 sec, iso800    Question: This secretive little Peruvian mystery bird was only recently described. Yet despite its air of mystery, it is known for a special talent. What talent is that? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: It seems like I&apos;ve been favouring wrens lately, huh? It&apos;s easy to be fond of wrens because they are so interesting and personable, and because they are such gifted singers.  This is an adult Inca wren, Pheugopedius eisenmanni, a recently described species that is endemic to a small area of Peru. They are shy little birds that are found only in montane bamboo scrub and bamboo temperate forest in the immediate vicinity of the ruins of Machu Picchu, Peru.  Inca wrens were recently removed from Thryothorus into Pheugopedius, both of which are in the Troglodytidae family. They are some of the most accomplished singers in the bird world. Inca wrens live in small family groups of 2-6 birds and both males and females sing loudly in a highly coordinated vocal chorus to defend their territories. Each individual bird makes its own specific contribution to the overall song chorus. Other species within the genus also produce their own (different) song choruses to defend territories.  Currently, the Inca wren and its congeners are being recorded whilst they sing and these audio recordings are being analysed for comparative studies of the entire genus. Here&apos;s one of those mp3 recordings of an Inca wren chorus, recorded at Machu Picchu:       [recordist] .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

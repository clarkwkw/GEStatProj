    "text": "The name should give you plenty of clues about the nature of Ubisoft&apos;s newly announced free-to-play dungeon crawler. It&apos;s silly, it&apos;s self-conscious and it wants to poke a bit of fun at this most straight-faced of ridiculous game genres. But that&apos;s not the main thing  Mighty Quest For Epic Loot is actually a clever blend of hack-n-slash action and map editing fun. The idea is simple. You build a castle using a simple drag and drop editor, fill it with traps and enemies, then upload it to the game&apos;s online world for others to raid. Every room and every monster you add to your building, and every scenic prop costs a certain amount of either virtual gold coins, or gems, which can be bought for real cash. As you add more to your building it levels up, unlocking new items and creatures. Once online, others can invade your castle and try to reach your treasure room to beat the level - at the end they&apos;re able to provide a score for your work as an architect (sort of Trip Advisor, but for fortresses), and high ranking creations will be slotted in among the main Ubisoft-crated missions in the title&apos;s online campaign mode.       And while you&apos;re not crafting the perfect deathtrap dungeon, you can choose your own hero character and go off to attack other people&apos;s creations. There are various classes to go for including knights and archers, all with their own different weapons and special powers: the knight for example has a smite move which allows him to do enormous damage to a foe with one deadly swing of his blade. And of course, enemies drop loot including armour and weaponry, and completing a castle earns your character XP which can be used to upgrade - without paying any real cash. You can also send challenges to friends, naming a castle and tempting them to beat your completion time - it&apos;s even possible to put some gold coins on as a wager. The whole things looks to be cleverly balanced. For example, each room has a set defensive value so you can only fill it with a certain number of guards and traps  this ensures nasty players aren&apos;t able to craft impassible bottlenecks of death. This isn&apos;t Dark Souls. In a neat touch, though, your final room has a higher value, allowing you to slip in a more powerful boss character, such as a giant cyclops. (There are also mini-bosses to abandon around the place  in the demo we saw, one was a large scuttling crab.)      The humour extends further than that daft title. Castle traps include a deadly spiked wheel which is driven back and forth by a giant hamster. One of the areas in the campaign is named Stabbinshire, and the end-of-level dragon is called Mr Firesly. It&apos;s not subtle, but then neither is invading a castle, killing everything and then stealing treasure.  The visuals have a cartoonish brightness, but all the tropes of the genre, from flaming torches to gothic arches, are here. It&apos;s such a compelling idea, which combines both social and hardcore gaming elements, and equips it all with a seemingly subtle monetisation system. If Ubisoft can support its creation with regular additions to the editor, this could well become a mighty time sink for epic looters. The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot is due out on PC in early 2013",

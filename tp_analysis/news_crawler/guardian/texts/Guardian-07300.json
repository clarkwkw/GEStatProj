    "text": "How do you drive a rover that&apos;s 248m kilometres away? The advantages of having wheels on your Mars lander are obvious  having safely delivered your scientifically priceless instruments over interplanetary distances, the last thing you need is for a particularly fascinating rock to be tantalisingly out of reach. When you&apos;re able to move your instruments to your target, it&apos;s so much easier to answer the mysteries of the universe, or at least a tiny part of it. The three Apollo astronaut crews who travelled to the moon with their own rovers in 1971-72 just had to hop in and drive off to explore sites well away from their landing sites. For unmanned rovers, however, adding wheels introduces more complexity and expense. Although the obvious way to drive a rover that&apos;s far away is through direct remote control, radio commands sent at the speed of light still take a long time to travel the huge distances between driver and wheels. This was a problem for the first unmanned planetary rovers: the Soviet Union&apos;s two Lunokhods, which landed on the moon in 1970 and 1973. Despite commands taking only 1.3s to reach the rovers, the team of five controlling them suffered from the stress of always trying to second-guess where the rover would be a few seconds hence. One small steering mistake on a slope could have left the rovers stranded like upturned beetles on the lunar surface. Despite the strains involved in driving them, both missions were hugely successful, with the wheeled robots operating for several months and covering tens of kilometres. You can see tracks here and here. Such remote control is largely impractical on Mars: radio signals currently take almost 14 minutes to reach it, so if Curiosity, known also as Mars Science Laboratory, was being sent individual commands to make each movement, it&apos;d take almost 30 minutes to check whether it had responded correctly. Mission operators either have to live with the painfully slow progress associated with operating a craft very gingerly so far away, or develop sophisticated fail-safe onboard systems to control rovers&apos; movements and avoid any hazards. The first mini-rover was delivered to Mars on the Soviet Mars 3 lander in 1971 but perished within minutes, having landed in a dust storm. Twenty-six years later, Nasa&apos;s Mars Pathfinder was delivered to the surface following a very bouncy, airbag-cushioned landing. Its Sojourner rover, which was the size of a microwave oven, trundled around a few metres from its landing pad carrying cameras and an X-ray spectrometer to test the make-up of rocks. It was issued regular commands to drive to new targets which it followed while continually testing for hazards using lasers, imaging and tilt sensors. Sojourner&apos;s baby steps continued for almost three months until the lander through which it was communicating with Earth fell silent. In 2003/04, Nasa&apos;s Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, landed on opposite sides of the planet to begin its most extensive surface exploration yet. Controlling these more sophisticated vehicles sometimes proved fiddly, especially early on. &quot;Though the hardware and software had been thoroughly tested, you never know exactly how they&apos;re going to perform until you start driving them,&quot; recalls former operations team member Dr Craig Leff, now working on the European Space Agency&apos;s ExoMars rover at University College London&apos;s Mullard Space Science Laboratory. &quot;They will all have little variances and you need to learn the idiosyncrasies of any particular vehicle.&quot; The rovers were equipped with autonomous navigation: when told their next target, they planned their own route to that spot and avoided hazards on their own. The hazard-avoidance systems were very sensitive early on in the mission, but operators became more comfortable with pushing the rovers&apos; abilities, and sometimes drove the rovers blind to maximise their speed. However, Opportunity spent almost 40 days immobile after an innocent-looking dune turned out to be a sand trap. Although meant to operate for only three months each, Spirit didn&apos;t fall silent until 2010, after two of its wheels stopped turning. It eventually succumbed to the harsh Martian winter. Opportunity is still going strong, and has driven 34km in the 3,000 Martian days since landing. It recently snapped this view eastwards across the Endeavour crater on Mars. The Mars Science Laboratory team obviously hope to clock as much mileage from the latest rover, but once the dust has settled today at Gale Crater, they plan to go easy on Curiosity: it may be a week before it leaves its landing spot. Once it gets going, progress is expected to be quicker than for Spirit and Opportunity. Nuclear power means there&apos;s no need to wait for sunlight to turn Curiosity&apos;s wheels, which are bigger to carry it largely unhindered across the rocky surface, and it won&apos;t be affected by dim lighting conditions during dust storms. It should cover at least 19km during its two-year mission. Scientists are eager for Curiosity to get rolling, but with no insurance or breakdown cover, it won&apos;t put its foot to the floor. Its maximum speed will be ninety metres per hour - about twice that of a giant tortoise.

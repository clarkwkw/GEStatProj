    "text": "&quot;While we do our good works let us not forget that the real solution lies in a world in which charity will have become unnecessary.&quot; So wrote the great African man of letters Chinua Achebe in his 1987 novel Anthills of the Savannah. His words should ring loud in the ears of those attending the global hunger event (Report, 27 July) in London this Sunday. At the summit &quot;good works&quot; will no doubt be done which we will applaud but for too long the dominant if well-meaning approach has been the short-term fix. We need to lift our ideas and open our eyes towards the new and changing Africa: a future where African children&apos;s experience of famine is only from history books. Let&apos;s be clear. Parts of Africa are blighted by poverty, hunger, war, corruption and the vagaries of a harsh and changing climate. Today severe hunger is stalking a huge swath of Africa from Senegal in the west to Chad, on through Sudan and all the way to Somalia in the east. More than 20 million people are affected. These parts of this vast continent need our collective support. Immediate aid is needed. But Africa also needs sustained long-term investment which helps people provide enough food for their families, build their own future, withstand the next challenge and lift their horizons beyond the latest crisis. Let&apos;s also be clear that the solution lies in Africa  a continent of vibrant, talented, creative and hard-working people. Africans need a relationship with the rest of the world that treats them as who they are  equals with something to offer. Every one of us on this planet is descended from shared but distant ancestors. Whether from those who stayed or from those who made those tentative steps out of the continent millennia ago, we are all African. Together we can make an African future where &quot;charity will have become unnecessary&quot;.Baaba Maal musician, SenegalAngelique Kidjo musician, BeninFemi Kuti musician, NigeriaHugh Masekela, musician, South AfricaOumou Sangare musician, MaliAmadou and Mariam musicians, MaliSidi Tour musician, MaliVieux Farka Tour musician, MaliDjimon Hounsou actor, US/BeninChiwetel Ejiofor actor, UK/NigeriaMulatu Astatke musician, EthiopiaJupiter musician, Democratic Republic of CongoMuntu Valdo musician, CameroonFatoumata Diawara musician, MaliIsmael Lo musician, Senegal2Face musician, NigeriaLami Philips musician, NigeriaSoundsultan musician, NigeriaY&apos;en A Marre activist movement, SenegalCheikh Lo SenegalKwame Anthony Appiah writer, UK/GhanaCroque Mort musician, ChadDidier Awadi musician, SenegalSara Mitaru musician, KenyaNanjira musician, KenyaOctopizzo musician, KenyaCamp Mulla musicians, KenyaIce Prince Zamani musician, NigeriaJesse Jagz Abaga musician, NigeriaJude MI Abaga musician, NigeriaBrymo Ashimi musician, NigeriaDavid &quot;Blackman&quot; Muthami producer, Kenya  You have recently reported on UN and Zimbabwean government predictions suggesting that up to 1.6 million people in the country will require food aid next year (Report, 1 August). This is an appalling position to be in. Zimbabwe used to be southern Africa&apos;s breadbasket but a combination of poor rainfalls and political turmoil has reduced output dramatically. The problems are exacerbated by a lack of skills and knowledge. But the response from the international development world to Zimbabwe&apos;s downfall has been mixed. I recently met the big agencies like USAid, World Bank and others on a trip to Harare with international development charity Practical Action. They want to see an emphasis on support to commercial farmers. They think that, if they can get the export market up and running, some of the income will trickle down to the 1.6 million who have very few resources. On reading the new report my thoughts are with Zimbabwean women I also met. I wonder what their fate will be, come January and February next year, when the problems are due to be at their worst.Rob CartridgeHead of practical answers, Practical Action",

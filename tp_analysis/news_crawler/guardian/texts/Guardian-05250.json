    "text": "British music startup Songkick has raised a 6.3m ($10m) funding round led by Sequoia, the US venture capital firm whose previous investments include Apple, Google, YouTube, PayPal and Dropbox. It&apos;s the first time Sequoia has invested in a startup headquartered in the UK, according to Songkick&apos;s chief executive Ian Hogarth, who says the funding will give his company the resources &quot;to continue to innovate&quot; in the months ahead. Songkick&apos;s existing investors, who include Index Ventures and Y Combinator, also participated in the new round. Songkick was set up by Hogarth and two friends, Michelle You and Pete Smith in 2007, with the aim of building a business around live music. Its service maintains global listings for music gigs, enabling fans to be alerted when their favourite artists announce a concert near them. The site now attracts 5m monthly unique visitors, which Hogarth says makes it the second biggest live-music site in the world behind Ticketmaster. &quot;We set this company up as three friends in an attic with the simple idea that fans would go to more concerts if someone made it really easy, and focused on the bands rather than just the venues,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve since gathered proof that it makes a meaningful difference to people&apos;s lives: when people start using Songkick, they go to almost twice as many gigs the year after.&quot; Songkick has tried to stay neutral since launching, working with ticketing firms including Ticketmaster, TicketWeb and Eventbrite on an affiliate basis: it doesn&apos;t sell tickets itself, but points its users towards those companies&apos; sites. Meanwhile, Songkick also has partnerships to provide its concert database to services including YouTube, Spotify, MTV, Vevo and SoundCloud. It also has a popular iPhone app, and was also one of the launch partners for Spotify&apos;s desktop apps platform in November 2011. Securing investment from Sequoia is a big deal for Songkick, but also for other startups in London or for that matter, the UK and Europe. Alongside Shazam (which counts Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Institutional Venture Partners among its investors) and SoundCloud (also KPCB, as well as Index and Union Square Ventures), Songkick shows that companies on this side of the Atlantic can attract investment from the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital firms. &quot;They&apos;ve invested in us despite where we are,&quot; says Hogarth, chuckling. &quot;The bar is much higher if you want to get investment from a west-coast Valley VC if you&apos;re in London. But Sequoia are a phenomenal venture capital firm, and [partner] Greg McAdoo is really aligned with our belief in connecting artists and fans.&quot; Songkick isn&apos;t saying much about its plans for the funding round, although Hogarth talks about ongoing work on new features and products that will launch later in 2012. There is competition, though, including from one of Songkick&apos;s key partners: Ticketmaster. The company has been adding more social and editorial features to its service in the last year or two. It also recently launched an iPhone app with a library-scanning feature similar to Songkick&apos;s own app, while its parent company Live Nation has just acquired startup Setlist.fm, which has built its own database of concerts and set lists. Could Ticketmaster eat Songkick&apos;s lunch? Hogarth chooses his words carefully. &quot;Our relationship with Ticketmaster is that we&apos;re a partner of theirs trying to sell more tickets for them as an e-commerce company,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re trying to be a great partner for those guys, but what&apos;s been a bit challenging for us to parse is what their strategy is. Every day they release something that is closer to what Songkick looks like than to what Ticketmaster used to look like. We have to try to read between the lines.&quot; Hogarth is bullish about Songkick&apos;s plans for new products later this year, though. In the meantime, he thinks other startups in the UK can take heart from his company&apos;s funding round, and what it says about Sequoia&apos;s openness to investing in other British companies. &quot;Hopefully now they have one investment in London, it may make it easier for them to make another one,&quot; he says.",

    "text": "Social travel service Gogobot has opened a European office in London, in an effort to boost the popularity of its site and app beyond its US homeland. Gogobot launched in November 2010 as a website, with an iPhone app following in October 2011. The company has raised $19m in funding so far, and its chief executive is Travis Katz, who used to run Myspace&apos;s international business. He says the idea for Gogobot came when travelling around Europe with his wife, and trying to research destinations online. &quot;We&apos;d get up on a Saturday morning, power up the computer, and eight hours later we&apos;d still be sitting there, more confused than when we started,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;d end up trying to work out if we knew anybody who&apos;d been there, and if not, I&apos;d throw up my hands and go to buy a Lonely Planet guide. There was something really wrong about not being able to figure this out using the internet.&quot; Gogobot&apos;s solution to that problem is to tap into Facebook&apos;s social graph, and get people to share their travel experiences for the benefit of their friends. The company&apos;s app now covers more than 60,000 destinations, with its photo-postcard feature one of the ways it encourages users to contribute to its database. There&apos;s also a feature to plan trips. &quot;When we started the company, we had a big debate over whether we should start as mobile then build a web component, or start as web and then go to mobile,&quot; says Katz. &quot;We knew mobile was going to be critical to the story: travel is the most natural use for mobile.&quot; When the company started, Katz admits he expected people to plan their holidays using Gogobot&apos;s website, then simply access the details from their phones when away, as well as using the postcard feature to share photos. &quot;We thought that people would probably want to do the research and planning on a bigger PC, but we&apos;ve actually found that they want to plan their trip on mobile as well,&quot; he says. &quot;We hadn&apos;t expected that at all. In fact, the number of trips being planned on mobile has already caught up to the number being planned on the web. Now we&apos;re thinking about how to make that experience richer on the mobile.&quot; According to social metrics site AppData, Gogobot currently has 450,000 monthly active users for its Facebook-connected app. Key competition is likely to come from established online travel sites adding social features, though. Katz is unsurprisingly bullish about the likely threat, suggesting that &quot;it&apos;s hard to do social as a bolt-on&quot;, while claiming that the big travel websites have a laser focus on &quot;optimising conversions from traffic coming in from search engines they&apos;re amazingly good at that, but it&apos;s not really social at its core&quot;. For the future, Gogobot is looking to improve its recommendation engine, having just hired &quot;one of the top recommendation experts in the US out of Stanford Research Institute&quot;. Katz says the company is also thinking about adding more offline features to its apps, to ensure they can be more useful for people who turn their smartphone&apos;s data off when abroad for fear of roaming fees. Keeping the pace of development up will be important, as more companies get into the social travel space. &quot;Travel is the most lucrative vertical on the internet, and social is the way everybody wants to interact on the web,&quot; says Katz. &quot;A lot of people are clamoring to get into this space, and we see a lot of the big guys copying us. Which at least is usually a sign that you&apos;re doing something right&quot;",

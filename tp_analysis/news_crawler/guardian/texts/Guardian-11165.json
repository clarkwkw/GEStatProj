    "text": "The deadline for applying to university is approaching. Most students have until mid-January to select their five university choices, spruce up their personal statements and submit their Ucas forms. As sixth-formers like me up and down the country will attest, this is no mean feat. What if you are not sure what you want to study at university? Or where you want to go? With most unis now charging 9,000 fees, no one can blame students for feeling a bit jittery about applying  the pressure to invest your time and money wisely is immense. Of course, it&apos;s important to consider your choices thoroughly, but there&apos;s nothing worse than feeling behind the curve. Last week, I pressed the &quot;submit&quot; button on the Ucas website and sent off my application to study English. It wasn&apos;t an easy decision to make. I spent the whole of my first year in sixth form not knowing what I wanted to do after school. It was frustrating, I felt as if I was letting myself down. The flood of open-day events, prospectuses and degree comparison websites made reaching a decision even harder. Worst of all was the feeling that I was falling behind. While my friends were excelling at their subjects and knew exactly which path they were taking, all I had to go on was the knowledge that I enjoyed English. How do I know which university to pick? Right now, I&apos;m interested in journalism, but what if I decide to take a different career path after I&apos;ve started uni? I decided to put my questions to university and careers experts. What if I make the wrong decision? Although applications need to be submitted by 15 January, your university choices aren&apos;t set in stone. Aside from Clearing, which is a chance to find an alternative university place during the summer, you may be able to switch courses once you&apos;ve started university, says Dr Ian Kenny, senior lecturer in the centre for computational intelligence at De Montfort University. &quot;There&apos;s normally a fairly short deadline for doing this; often within two weeks of starting the first year. Such transfers will be at the discretion of the course leader and perhaps a head of department.&quot; I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;d like to do after university  does this matter? Generally speaking  no, says careers adviser Hannah Morton-Hedges. &quot;The majority of graduate employers don&apos;t specify a particular degree discipline for their training programmes. And those that do  normally the more scientific careers  can usually be accessed by postgraduate qualifications or other training routes.&quot; What&apos;s more important, says Morton-Hedges, is the class of degree you obtain and the extra-curricular activities you participate in while studying. How do I know if I&apos;ll enjoy my course? Ask as many questions as possible before applying, says Prof Anthony Woodman, pro vice-chancellor at the University of West London. &quot;It&apos;s critical that you gain information that is useful for you and that you feel comfortable when making your university choices. Sources of information that work for one person may not work for someone else.&quot; Woodman suggests talking to university staff, current students and your school career adviser. How can I pick between the different courses on offer? Spend as much time as possible looking in detail at the modules on the course, recommends Kenny. &quot;The title of a degree is only a rough guide to its content, the actual module details will give a better idea of what the course is about. Try to imagine yourself in the lectures. Do you really want to immerse yourself in these subjects every day for three years?&quot; Do I need to bother looking at league tables? Students now have access to a lot of information about courses, says Kenny. &quot;On each university course web page, there should be a link to the Key Information Set. This is a valuable source of information  for example, students can look to see what proportion of graduates are in employment six months after the end of a course.&quot; But remember, he adds, statistics don&apos;t always give the full picture.",

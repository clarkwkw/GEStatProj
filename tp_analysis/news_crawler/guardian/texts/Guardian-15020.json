    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Planets Defense is a game of solar system domination with no plot or scene setting, just you against the red spaceships.

It&apos;s not particularly well explained and feels low budget, but despite these rough edges, its stately pace and finely balanced mechanisms make it almost hypnotic once it gets going. An intriguing toy for armchair tacticians. ",

    "text": "My friend and former boss Joe McNally, who has died of cancer aged 69, launched Compaq into the UK personal computer market in 1984, shortly after the company was founded in the US. He did so on his own, apart from a secretary, with initial funds of $40,000 and a rented office in Piccadilly, delivering the first machines by taxi. Working frequently from gut instinct, and with a laser focus on &quot;the number&quot; (the current month&apos;s revenue), he built an eclectic team, frequently hiring young staff and delegating an unusual level of responsibility. The company&apos;s growth was amazing. In the mid-1980s, IBM&apos;s PC division was 400 times our size. By the mid-1990s we had overtaken them. Joe&apos;s choice of John Cleese to front some innovative and cheeky advertising was a notable success. When Joe retired in 2001 as chairman of Compaq  which had by then combined with Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard  the total UK revenues from sales and manufacturing amounted to $6bn, with a headcount of 6,000. As financial director, I watched Joe at close quarters for 15 years. Frequently gruff (partly for show), and routinely scheduling meetings at 7.30am, he earned respect and loyalty  which he reciprocated. Born and raised on Tyneside, Joe attended Gateshead grammar school and gained his business acumen the hard way. He was sacked (twice) from the steel stockholders Miles Druce by his own father, the managing director, before he found his feet over nine years as a computer programmer and salesman with ICL and Honeywell. He then joined the meat processors FMC Harris as director of their southern operations, broadening his general management experience and becoming chief executive designate, before a hostile takeover saw him again out of a job. Joe was very interested in opening up opportunities for youth employment and for more than 20 years was closely involved with the Duke of Edinburgh&apos;s award scheme, latterly as trustee. For this he was made a CVO in 2011. He is survived by his wife, Anne, whom he married in 1968, and their children, Kirsten and Joseph Daniel, and two grandsons, Millen and Joseph Jack.",

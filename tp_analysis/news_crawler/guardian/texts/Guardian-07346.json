    "text": "Another day, another doodling Olympics challenge. And after hurdles, basketball and canoeing/kayaking, here comes ... goalkeeping. This one is pretty simple. Just go to the Google homepage, click on the play icon, then use the left and right cursors to move your keeper from side to side, and the space bar to leap into the air. Fortunately, the player taking the shots is more Garath Southgate than Andrea Pirlo, so the game quickly becomes a sort of endurance test  how long can you justify pressing the space bar and cursor keys on a browser-based goalkeeping simulation? True, Southgate does start speeding up the kicks as the challenge progresses, but unless you&apos;re simultaneously taking a call from accounts or re-arranging your pen holder, this should present no real difficulty. I clocked up 38 while reading a Simpsons comic to my son this morning. Perhaps Google is going easy on us because it&apos;s Friday? Maybe they have something super fiendish ready for tomorrow? I don&apos;t know, because when I emailed their UK office for some information on the games, the response was: &quot;Google does not comment on Google doodles.&quot; So we&apos;re on our own today, facing a relentless yet mediocre penalty taker, forever (or going by the scoreboard until you pass 999 saves ...)",

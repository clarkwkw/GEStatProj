    "text": "Come the inevitable zombie apocalypse, the ability to run a few miles to evade the shuffling hordes would be handy, which is where Zombies, Run! (App store, Six to Start &amp; Naomi Alderman, 5.49) comes in. Teaming up with novelist Alderman, and using crowd-sourced funding, the developers have created a running aid/audio adventure combined, offering something far more engaging than the athletes&apos; monotoned encouragement on Nike+. Over 13 missions (with 17 more to come free in this first season), you take the part of Runner 5 and have this tale of the undead piped into your ears. As you run, the iPhone&apos;s GPS tracks your pace  the moans growing louder as brain-eaters approach, forcing an increase in tempo to escape them. You also collect items as you run, which are used to bolster the survivors&apos; base, adding an extra layer of interest beyond the number of calories burnt. The missions last about 25 minutes, consisting of five sections interspersed with your own tunes: perfect for all levels of jogger. It may seem odd that running is required to escape &quot;the walking dead&quot;, but an engaging story provides a better reason than most to hit the road  until of course the zombies actually rise and provide some truly deadly motivation.",

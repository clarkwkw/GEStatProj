    "text": "Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates praised Britain for &quot;leading the way&quot; on tackling child hunger as the UK government committed 655m over the next six years to saving millions from chronic malnutrition. The philanthropist&apos;s comments followed a surprise announcement by international development minister Justine Greening, who told the Nutrition Summit in London the money would save the lives of 1.7 million under-fives in the developing world. At a rally in central London, thousands of hunger campaigners welcomed the announcement, saying it was at the top end of the list of measures which they had been pushing for from the UK, which will host a meeting of the G8 group of the world&apos;s richest countries on 17-18 June. David Bull, spokesman for campaign group Enough Food For Everyone IF, which organised the Hyde Park rally, welcomed the move. He said: &quot;This is a turning point in tackling what is the biggest killer of children worldwide.&quot; Among the speakers was Danny Boyle, director of the Olympic opening ceremony, who said ending world hunger would be &quot;the greatest gold medal Britain could win in 2013&quot;. Gates, standing beside an artificial field of two million petals, representing the number of lives campaigners hope could be saved, added: &quot;The UK is keeping its promise to the world&apos;s poor, largely because all of you remind your leaders regularly, and loudly, that this stuff matters.&quot; This was the largest demonstration against global inequality in Britain since the Make Poverty History march of 2005. A report issued by The Lancet last week said nearly half of the deaths of under-fives  3.1 million children  each year were principally caused by malnutrition. Following the announcement, government officials were keen to emphasise that 375m of this money was core funds with a further 280m tied to &quot;matched&quot; funding. The initial tranche will be immediately available to be spent on educating mothers, especially about breastfeeding, and the provision of foods fortified with micronutrients and vitamins to mothers and young children. The programmes aim to reduce by 20 million the total of 165 million children currently damaged by under-nutrition. The rest of the money will be available to match, on a two-for-one basis, funds pledged by other donors, both governments and businesses. Officials said &quot;substantial&quot; pledges had already been received, with the programme opening up &quot;a new era in transparency&quot;. A further 597m of existing UK aid programmes for agriculture will be repurposed to ensure they tackle child hunger. Greening also announced that a further 2.63bn for a Global Nutrition for Growth initiative had been pledged by other donors, including foundations, charities and businesses. Opening the summit, David Cameron told fellow leaders, businessmen and philanthropists that Britain would &quot;lead from the front&quot; on world hunger, but added: &quot;We will not tackle hunger and malnutrition without business.&quot; Commercial companies are expected to help deliver the programme, especially by developing vitamin-enriched varieties of vegetables for farmers to grow. But some hunger campaigners have criticised the inclusion of biotech companies such as Syngenta and Monsanto. In a joint statement, War on Want and others accused Britain and other countries of launching a &quot;new wave of colonialism&quot; in Africa, and asked it to abandon the privatisation of agricultural techniques. Cameron also defended the UK aid budget, saying that it not only made him &quot;proud to be British&quot; but that it was equivalent to just 1p from every 1 of tax paid. &quot;We accept the moral case for keeping our promises to the world&apos;s poor,&quot; he said. &quot;When people are dying, we don&apos;t believe in finding excuses. We believe in trying to do something about it.&quot;  This article was amended on the 10th of June 2013. The original said that 2.63m had been pledged for a Global Nutrition for Growth initiative this has been corrected to 2.63bn ",

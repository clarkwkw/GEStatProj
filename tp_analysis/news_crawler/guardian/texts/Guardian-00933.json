    "text": "The ISS is making some spectacular transits across Britain&apos;s predawn sky, often emerging from eclipse in the directions flagged by asterisks in our predictions. Meanwhile, Phobos-Grunt, the Russian Mars mission that became stranded in Earth orbit in November, finally reentered the atmosphere over the SE Pacific off the coast of southern Chile at about 17:45 GMT last Sunday. If it had managed to remain in orbit for only another 30 minutes it would have come down over southern Europe along a path roughly from Gibraltar to Venice. As it is, pieces from the probe probably fell into the ocean and there may be no witnesses and no ill effects from the toxic fuel it carried.

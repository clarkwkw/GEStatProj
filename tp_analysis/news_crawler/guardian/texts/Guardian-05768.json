    "text": "As the leader of the team invited to evaluate the public debate called GM Nation? in 2002-03 (Back to the battlefields, G2, 23 May), I would like to point out (yet again) that the initiative was not a survey, as conventionally understood, and was not based on anything like a representative sample of British citizens. Rather, participants in the debate activities were self-selecting. There is certainly significant opposition to GM in the UK, but the evidence suggests a greater number are more ambivalent. Indeed, evidence generated by GM Nation? suggests people&apos;s anxieties about the technology might not be so important if they could see clear advantages in terms of what GM products might offer them. For me, the real surprise is that advocates of GM have not been more bold in articulating the potential advantages (whatever they might be) of their products for consumers.

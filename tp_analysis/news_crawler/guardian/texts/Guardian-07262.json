    "text": "I&apos;m looking for a way to post videos and photos of my child so that family members in far flung places can see her growing up. Rather than posting private videos on YouTube and then emailling the link, I would prefer to be able to set up a private network so that I can upload and others can view them at their leisure. I am keen that the photos and videos do not end up in the public domain, so I am wary of Facebook, Google Plus, etc. Are there any simple solutions that will allow me to share while maintaining my daughter&apos;s privacy  at least until she is old enough to choose what she shares with the wider world?Greg ThomasThere are dozens of simpler ways to share photos and videos online than setting up a private network. I suggested a few fairly recently (22 March) when family history enthusiast David Bogle asked about Sharing personal files around the world.  That was a data-oriented question  David had 1GB of data in 37 folders  so it didn&apos;t make the 60W bulb in my brain light up with the same response as your query: Shutterfly. Sharing family photos and videos privately is a very common problem, and some popular websites try to cater for it. Shutterfly was set up as an online photo service and it makes money by selling you prints, photo books, greetings cards and other image-bearing merchandise. This means Shutterfly is careful to keep your original full-sized, printable image rather than throwing it away after creating a web-sized version. However, it only displays web-sized versions, so you and other members of your family cannot download the originals and print them out yourself without a paid subscription.  Shutterfly&apos;s main attraction is that it offers free family websites based on its Shutterfly Share service. Your site gets its own web address, and you can upload an unlimited number of photos. Three years ago, Shutterfly added video sharing: you can upload up to 10 videos using the free service, or an unlimited number of high-definiton videos if you sign up for its Premium Video service for $49.99 (32.17) per year (currently $29.99). For extra security, Shutterfly lets you add a password to protect your family website from people who only know its internet address. A family-friendly alternative to Shutterfly is Dropshots, which bills itself as &quot;next generation photo and video sharing&quot;. Again, Dropshots lets you password-protect your page so that only people who have both the link and the password can access photos and videos.  If you are willing to split videos from still photos, you could upload your videos to Vimeo. Most people think of it as just an upmarket, higher-quality version of YouTube, but it does allow you to password-protect each video separately, and keep videos so private that only you can see them. You can also block downloads. The FAQ section on privacy says: &quot;You can share password-protected videos by clicking the &apos;Share&apos; button on your video, then entering the email address or name of the person you&apos;d like to share your video with (if they also have an account on Vimeo). An email will be sent with a link to your video and the password.&quot;  If you are a paying (Vimeo Pro) user, you can set up semi-private, unlisted Video Review Pages where you can share movies and get comments from users who don&apos;t have free Vimeo accounts. Viddler also offers advanced privacy options for sharing videos, but the cheapest subscription costs $50 per month. As mentioned in the previous reply to David Bogle, you can also use more general services. The main ones are Microsoft&apos;s SkyDrive (which now has 7GB of free space, not 25GB), Google Docs, and Dropbox. It&apos;s worth trying them to see which suits you and your family best, and I use all three. However, I find non-expert users tend to have more success with SkyDrive, if they use it in conjunction with the desktop version of Windows Live Mail. Basically, you can decide to email your family new photos or videos, but follow the prompts to upload them to SkyDrive and mail them links instead. When you want to unshare things, you can easily move them to a different, private folder. Also, as previously-mentioned, you could set up your own private server at home using a Pogoplug, which is close enough to having a private network. The drawback with sharing things online is that privacy is only as good as the security awareness of your family. This is probably as close to zero as makes no difference. Once you&apos;ve sent people links to albums and videos, there is nothing to stop them from forwarding the same links to friends (&quot;Oh, isn&apos;t she cute!&quot;), which is why password-protection is important.            But once members of your family have downloaded copies of your photos and videos, there is nothing to stop them from sharing them however they like. If you produce something as viral as Charlie bit my finger  again!, your private video could ultimately end up being viewed by 500 million people. You can tilt things in your favour by only using sites that don&apos;t put any pictures on public display, that prevent search engines from indexing them, and that enable password protection. Nonetheless, digital images and videos are easily and almost infinitely reproducible, so something shared with two people can quickly millions. Unless you can live with this (admittedly unlikely) prospect, don&apos;t share things at all. However, today&apos;s children and teenagers seem to be a lot less bothered about sharing things than their parents. There is, as yet, no sign of this trend being reversed. If Facebook, Foursquare and similar sites get hooked up with Google Glasses and the whole &quot;quantified self&quot; movement, then what former Sun boss Scott McNealy said in 1999 may well turn out to be true: &quot;You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.&quot;",

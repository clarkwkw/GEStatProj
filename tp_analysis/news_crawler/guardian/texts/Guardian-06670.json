    "text": "O2 was having a nightmare of an evening, and morning, after the failure of its service over Wednesday night affected huge numbers of customers. And in the front line were the in-house &quot;social media team&quot; in charge of the &quot;@O2 in the UK&quot; account on Twitter, who had to deal with the ire of the company&apos;s many customers. But by demonstrating a lightness of touch at their angrier respondents, the team rapidly gained the admiration of the watching hordes. Graham Cummings  who gives his location as Stirling  was among those to receive the ju-jitsu methods employed by the team.     @O2 FUCK YOU! SUCK DICK IN HELL. &mdash; Graham Cummings (@grahamcummings7) July 12, 2012     Which earned the response:     @grahamcummings7 Maybe later, got tweets to send right now. &mdash; O2 in the UK (@O2) July 12, 2012     Another was Ashley Roberts, who was hardly enamoured of O2&apos;s attempts to get on customers&apos; good side  but discovered the team wasn&apos;t treating the offer as rhetorical:    @AshleyRoberts61 She says no thanks.&mdash; O2 in the UK (@O2) July 12, 2012    An O2 spokesperson said that the team hadn&apos;t had any particular instructions on how to respond to people. &quot;Clearly we&apos;re not happy that we&apos;ve disappointed our customers over the last 24 hours, but it&apos;s good to hear that some have enjoyed our tweets,&quot; they said.",

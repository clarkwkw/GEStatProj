    "headline": "Samsung gets Galaxy tablet sales ban lifted in US", 
    "text": "A court has lifted a temporary sales ban on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet, allowing the company to sell the product in the US. While the Galaxy 10.1 is an older model, the lifting of the ban could still help Samsung in the runup to the pivotal festive season. The court had previously fined the Korean tech giant $1bn for infringing Apple patents and too closely mimicking its designs. &quot;We are pleased with the court&apos;s action today, which vindicates our position that there was no infringement of Apple&apos;s design patent and that an injunction was not called for,&quot; Samsung said in a statement. Separately, Samsung filed a motion on Monday against Apple in a California court saying the iPhone 5 had infringed some of the company&apos;s patents  and indicated that it will begin legal action aimed at banning it from sale in the US, a move which could cripple Apple&apos;s business. &quot;We have always preferred to compete in the marketplace with our innovative products, rather than in courtrooms. However, Apple continues to take aggressive legal measures that will limit market competition,&quot; Samsung said in a statement. It added that it had &quot;little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights&quot;. Samsung is said to be the world&apos;s largest smartphone maker, ahead of Apple, but lags in the tablet field, where it sold an estimated 2m devices in the second quarter of this year against Apple&apos;s 17m iPads. The world&apos;s top two smartphone makers are locked in patent disputes in 10 countries as they vie to dominate the lucrative market. The legal fight began last year when Apple sued Samsung in multiple countries, and the Korean firm countersued. Since then though neither side had won a decisive victory  until Apple&apos;s $1bn win, which is now being disputed by both sides. Samsung claims the jury used flawed reasoning, while Apple is seeking to raise the damages by about $700m ($433m). Meanwhile, Samsung&apos;s use of patents deemed essential to standards such as 3G networking has triggered an antitrust investigation by the European commission which could lead to a fine if it is found to have abused its ownership of those patents. The injunction on the Galaxy tablet had been put in place ahead of the month-long trial which Apple won in the US. However, the jury found that Samsung&apos;s tablet had not violated Apple&apos;s D&apos;889 &quot;trade dress&quot; patent  essentially covering the cosmetic appearance of the iPad  which was the basis for the tablet injunction, and the Korean firm argued the sales ban should be lifted. &quot;The court does not agree with Apple that Samsung&apos;s motion for dissolution of the 26 June preliminary injunction cannot be fairly decided without resolving Apple&apos;s post-trial motions,&quot; Judge Lucy Koh said in her ruling. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.",

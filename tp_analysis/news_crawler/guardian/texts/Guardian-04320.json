    "text": "Twonky? It sounds more like an obscure dubstep sub-genre than a cutting-edge app. But technology industry veteran PacketVideo is doing some interesting things with its range of Twonky apps for Android and iOS. It&apos;s best described as media-sharing software, for squirting music, photos and videos between computers, mobile devices, hi-fis and TVs around the home. They started with Twonky Mobile, a smartphone app for finding media on your home network and then beaming it to a TV or DLNA / AirPlay-compatible TV. It&apos;s since been joined by Twonky Video, which aggregates web videos to beam to a bigger screen, and Twonky Beam, which works with audio and photos as well as videos. &quot;The big feature we&apos;ve added to Twonky Beam is our DLNA-certified media server, which is very popular,&quot; says Rick Schwartz, director of connected home software at PacketVideo. &quot;A lot of people are running the app on their smartphones, and then they&apos;ll go to a friend&apos;s house, and if they have a PlayStation 3 console, a Samsung smart TV or an Apple TV, for example, they can access all the content on their device in a very seamless way.&quot; He summarises Twonky&apos;s intended appeal thus: smartphones are very good for discovering content, but they&apos;re not always the best device to actually watch or listen to it especially if there&apos;s a TV in the room that&apos;s connected to the home wireless network. &quot;It&apos;s great to discover video on mobile devices, but there&apos;s not been an easy way to beam that content to your big screen. We&apos;re trying to insert ourself into that spot,&quot; he says. But PacketVideo is thinking beyond the living room with Twonky. &quot;We&apos;re doing a lot of work in the connected car, which I think is really on the horizon now,&quot; says Schwartz. &quot;We&apos;re going to see the car become a media server, and also see it sync with your home network. You&apos;ll buy a new album and it will automatically sync with your car. Plus the car is going to become a mobile hotspot pretty soon&quot; PacketVideo is also busily doing deals with telcos and consumer electronics companies to use the technology behind Twonky, with 30 having signed up so far. The Twonky apps show off the tech and prove there&apos;s a demand, and then the money comes from the hardware deals. &quot;That&apos;s what&apos;s paying the bills as our ecosystem continues to grow,&quot; says Schwartz. &quot;We could do some subtle advertising on the MyTwonky portal, but that&apos;s more a future thing for us. Right now, we don&apos;t need to do it: we want to get the biggest audience possible.&quot;",

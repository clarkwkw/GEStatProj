    "text": "War  as Fallout&apos;s catchphrase has it  never changes, and the majority of current shooters do seem to reinforce this sentiment. On the surface, Spec Ops: The Line is no different to its rivals. Rugged US soldiers shoot various ne&apos;er-do-wells in the Middle East. Beneath its shifting sands, however, something more interesting awaits. Captain Walker leads a special forces team through Dubai in pursuit of the US 33rd battalion, which had entered the capital city to rescue the survivors of a series of devastating sandstorms before vanishing. The 33rd&apos;s Colonel Konrad is Walker&apos;s idol, and he must quickly grapple with his fear that Konrad is responsible for a string of atrocities that are soon uncovered in the ruined metropolis. The weaving narrative that follows is handled with great skill; its explorations of false heroism and the realities of war wouldn&apos;t look out of place in a Terrence Malick film. Unfortunately, the game&apos;s haphazard controls and unsuitably rigid level design significantly spoil the suspension of disbelief. This is a shame, as even a bog-standard choice system and slightly improved control response would have elevated The Line to greatness. As it is, anyone looking for an above-average gunplay romp with interesting ideas could do a lot worse.",

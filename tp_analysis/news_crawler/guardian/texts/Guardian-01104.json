    "text": "The sleet came across the loch in gusts, stinging my face if I faced the wrong way, and I sought shelter on the leeward side of the old boathouse clad with bark. Looking through the window I saw the old swallows&apos; nest from last year with white droppings still staining the woodwork below. There was a lull in the wind and I set out along the edge of the loch for the distant Scots pines. The water lapped at my feet as I passed the boat we use to fish the loch in the summer. It was hauled out for the winter and by now we should have put it in the boathouse for when the weather turns for the worse. Strangely, the water of the loch was only rippling so perhaps the wind and sleet were battering it too much to make waves. One unusual aspect was that halfway along the loch there was a wide strip of ice from shore to shore with a few clumps of snow on top and then beyond more open water. I had expected whooper swans on the loch at this time of the year but there were no birds at all and it was almost eerie. Then a bird call as a raven&apos;s guttural croak came across the loch although I could not see the bird. The raven&apos;s call carries some distance so it could have been on the snow-clad hills behind. The Scots pines were as awesome as ever; the browns and reds of the bark contrasted with the dark green of the needles and well might they be called the &quot;king of the forest&quot;. I felt I could just put my arms around the biggest tree but instead looked below for signsof red squirrels and crossbills. Some of the cones on the ground had been torn down to their cores, a sign of feeding red squirrels, while others were part open from crossbill activity. No sign of the culprits in such weather.",

    "text": "Peter Molyneux didn&apos;t make his name in the games industry by shying away from ambitious, risky projects, from god games Populous and Powermonger through Black &amp; White, the Fable games and prototype Kinect title Project Milo. 2012 saw him exploring new frontiers through indie studio 22cans. First with a freemium massively-multiplayer tile-chipping game for iOS and Android called Curiosity  What&apos;s Inside the Cube, and then by raising 527k on Kickstarter to make Project Godus, a &quot;reinvention of Populous&quot; for Mac, PC and mobile devices. What has Molyneux learned from the last 12 months? In a keynote session at the F2P Summit conference in London, he explained, starting with the development problem that he thinks free-to-play games are solving. &quot;In a way, we&apos;ve always had this problem when we&apos;ve made computer games,&quot; he said, describing the experience of spending 2-3 years making a Fable game with a team of 100-150 people, releasing it on a Friday, and then hearing players boasting about having completed it by the Saturday. &quot;There was the realisation that in certain circumstances it [free-to-play] can stretch that gameplay time out so that people don&apos;t obsessively play for six or more hours,&quot; he said. &quot;It does pull out that time, and it requires people to wait and see what comes up.&quot; Molyneux also said free-to-play solves another specific problem for traditional games developers &quot;this terrible phrase from marketing: &apos;Can we have a demo of the game?&apos;&quot; that often came at the crunch point for development. &quot;That&apos;s another thing that free-to-play did. The game itself is the demo, and the demo is the game,&quot; said Molyneux.&quot;I&apos;ve been wanting something like free-to-play as a designer for years and years, and now it&apos;s here I&apos;m absolutely fascinated by it.&quot; He admitted that there are plenty of design challenges, including keeping the quality level high for a game where new content is being regularly made available for its players. &quot;I have to bully myself to think in a very different way. It&apos;s less about bombarding the player with feature after feature. It&apos;s more about stretching those features out,&quot; said Molyneux, who talked enthusiastically about the power of anticipation, and the fact that &quot;if you stretch it perfectly, people will do unbelievable things to achieve a certain goal.&quot; Curiosity lessons Curiosity is the &quot;hyper-example&quot; of that, as millions of players downloaded it to chip away at surfaces of a giant cube with the ultimate aim of revealing what lay at its centre. It was 22cans&apos; first game after the studio was founded in early 2012. &quot;I thought that free-to-play this idea of giving people an experience that is free and which they can play around with was something we needed to play around with,&quot; he said. &quot;I tried to think of the simplest thing for our team to get its teeth into And I thought in my naive mind that this would be something the world would take a look at, and that would be the end of it.&quot; Curiosity really was an experiment, then. Just an experiment that was downloaded by millions within its first few days on the app stores, which in turn saw 22cans struggling to scale its back-end infrastructure to cope. &quot;It was insanely successful, and in that success was our biggest challenge,&quot; said Molyneux. &quot;Within a few days, the response times had gone down to minutes rather than fractions of a second. We had to panic and solve that.&quot; One feature that never made it into Curiosity was plans to charge $77k for an in-app purchase of a &quot;Diamond Chisel&quot; tool to vastly speed up the chipping process. Why not? &quot;It was a challenge to get the platform-holders like Apple and Android to understand what we were really trying to experiment with,&quot; said Molyneux. &quot;With the Diamond Chisel, our ambition was to charge an impossibly-high amount  so high that no one in the world would buy it. It was more the psychology of knowing that this hugely valuable thing was there But when we submitted the app to platform holders like the App Store, they turned around and said &apos;Oh my goodness, you can&apos;t charge that amount!&apos;&quot; 22cans did manage to sell lower-priced virtual items in Curiosity: a draw mode for players with artistic intentions, access to more statistics for others, and a fun &quot;Golden Badger&quot; character for younger players. Molyneux didn&apos;t give revenue figures other than saying that the Android version of Curiosity generates a quarter of the revenues of the iOS version  but said the 69p stats purchase was &quot;by far and away the most successful&quot; of the three.     Curiosity What's Inside the Cube?    F2P v console The experience has left Molyneux more enthusiastic about free-to-play gaming than ever, it&apos;s fair to say. He had some thoughts on how these games differ from traditional console titles too. &quot;If you think of console games as the equivalent of films you go to the cinema, you watch it, consume it, you&apos;re done with itthat&apos;s what I think console games are like,&quot; he said. &quot;I think free-to-play games are more like TV series. You watch a TV series for half an hour or 40 minutes, wait for a period of time then watch another one. That&apos;s more like what free-to-play is.&quot; Molyneux noted that just as TV shows are crafted around that mode of consumption  end-of-episode cliffhangers being one examplethe best free-to-play games must be structured around the habits of their players. There&apos;s a downside, though. Molyneux criticised (while not naming) &quot;some bad examples of people trying to squeeze more money out of consumers&quot; with free-to-play titles, or by slapping in-app purchases into games not originally designed for that purpose. &quot;You can&apos;t introduce free-to-play mechanics to a title six months after it&apos;s released,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s got to be part of the design. It can&apos;t just be crammed in there later on.&quot; Curiosity&apos;s players still haven&apos;t reached the centre of the cube, although Molyneux said the game is &quot;moving into the final phase&quot; very soon, after which he&apos;ll be able to judge its success as a game and as a business model. &quot;The race to the centre. And then when that&apos;s all finished and we reveal what&apos;s in the middle or hopefully reveal what&apos;s in the middle then we&apos;ll truly measure its success,&quot; he said. Godus ambitions 22cans is already hard at work on its next game, Godus, following that successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. The project was partly born out of Molyneux&apos;s fascination with Kickstarter, and his desire to revive the genre god-games that made his original studio Bullfrog Productions famous. &quot;I feel that the god-game genre embodies everything that free-to-play is,&quot; he said. &quot;The god game genre was almost invented for free-to-play 25 years ago. It works so beautifully for what free-to-play represents.&quot; Godus will be free-to-play, and while Molyneux admitted this brings challenges on PC and Mac where the model is less popular, in characteristic style he talked up the impact freemium mechanics will have on the game. &quot;It is already a fantastic, amazing and incredible game, and free-to-play makes it even more fantastic, amazing and incredible,&quot; he said, before sharing some gameplay details about Godus&apos; iOS and Android incarnation. It will be based around a single-player environment called &quot;Homeworld&quot;, where players sculpt the landscape with their fingers, and oversee their growing population of virtual inhabitants. The bigger the population, the more godly powers are unlocked. And at any point, some of those people can be taken out of Homeworld to battle in a &quot;very simple multiplayer game&quot;, where players can win more people, and thus unlock more powers.     Concept artwork for Godus    Excavation plans There&apos;s more to the gameplay though. &quot;There&apos;s definitely some Dungeon Keeper, it&apos;s about excavating,&quot; said Molyneux, referring to another well-loved Bullfrog game. &quot;What we realised was and this is all to do with free-to-play that there is this terrible moment that consumers get to when they say &apos;Why am I doing this? Why am I planting crops? Why am I building buildings? Why am I sculpting the land?&apos; And that&apos;s the point where you have to subtly show people there&apos;s a reason why.&quot; Hence excavating in Godus, which Molyneux explained in an example that wouldn&apos;t look out of place in the feed of (affectionate) parodic Twitter account Peter Molydeux. &quot;You&apos;re sculpting, and you spot a bit of terrain that looks a bit different,&quot; he said. &quot;You realise there&apos;s a nose protruding from the land, so you keep on sculpting and pushing the land around, and there&apos;s this face. And it&apos;s a huge massive statue of you buried in this hill!&quot; The thinking here: &quot;That gives you a reason to carry on sculpting. It&apos;s not just about serving the needs of your little people. It&apos;s about discovering things, and excavating.&quot; F2P attitudes Molyneux also talked about how free-to-play games studios are seen within the games industry and outside it, including the investors who got excited at the rise of Zynga, then spooked when its share price dropped post-IPO. He said that the more recent success of Finnish developer Supercell  currently making $2.4m a day from its Clash of Clans and Hay Day games on iOS alone  has reawakened investor interest. &quot;If you&apos;re working in free-to-play, VCs and investors are fascinated by it,&quot; said Molyneux. He went on to talk about players, and the perceived snobbery towards free-to-play games from &quot;core&quot; gamers who see console and/or PC gaming as having more depth. &quot;The core gamers have yet to see a game in my opinion that really justifies their attention,&quot; said Molyneux, referring to his earlier film/TV analogy. &quot;At the moment as far as they&apos;re concerned, they&apos;re watching Skyfall, and we&apos;re asking them to go to free-to-play, which is like watching In The Night Garden. There&apos;s got to be a middle ground.&quot; It&apos;s this middle-ground that 22cans is targeting with Godus, which Molyneux hopes will appeal to both kinds of gamers. Regulation worries Molyneux was also asked about attitudes within the games industry towards free-to-play, and said that developers would &quot;be very foolhardy to turn your nose up&quot; at the model. However, he warned that snobbery exists on both sides of the debate. &quot;People like [Zynga CEO] Mark Pincus rubbed a lot of the industry up the wrong way because he said console games are dead,&quot; said Molyneux. &quot;We can&apos;t have snobbishness on either of those [sides].&quot; Regulators are getting interested in free-to-play games at the moment, with the UK&apos;s Office of Fair Trading launching an investigation into how these games and their in-app purchases are marketed to children, and whether some developers are breaking existing laws in the process. &quot;If I was a betting man I&apos;d think the platform providers will start trying to answer that question fairly soon,&quot; said Molyneux, referring to Apple and Google. &quot;You can&apos;t have people racking up bills of hundreds or thousands of pounds without them knowing what they&apos;re doing,&quot; he continued, while warning that among adults &quot;some people love spending money, and we shouldn&apos;t stop that&quot;. Molyneux also warned of the risks for the games industry of regulations varying around the world, and the danger (for developers) that publicity around irresponsible free-to-play games has a knock-on effect for the responsible ones. &quot;We&apos;ve got to be careful that the OFT doesn&apos;t create a regime where us developers don&apos;t want to develop for the UK, so you have to be very careful,&quot; he said. &quot;We also have to be careful that we don&apos;t fall into the trap of making our games the equivalent of gambling, where parents will say &apos;my kid must never play one of these games&apos;.&quot; Kickstarter lessons Molyneux finished off by talking about lessons learned from the Godus Kickstarter campaign, which he described as a &quot;rollercoaster ride&quot; while noting that many crowdfunding campaigns have a similar pace. &quot;You start high, you have a lot of enthusiasts coming in gamers who&apos;ve maybe played Populous and want to play it again in our case and then after three days you&apos;ve got all those people, and it slumps down,&quot; he said. The middle of the campaign thus becomes &quot;this terrible doldrum&quot; where the pledge total is crawling rather than shooting upwards, and fears mount that it will never hit its target. &quot;Then suddenly for seemingly no reason at all, in the last few days it picks up again,&quot; said Molyneux, although he proceeded to give a reason. &quot;95% of people pledging at the end of the Kickstarter campaign were serial pledgers. They were people who have pledged on more than 10 projects, and there were a couple of examples of people who have pledged over the last year to over 500 projects!&quot; Hence his advice to developers to always ask for less money than they actually need when crowdfunding: &quot;If you need 100k, ask for 50k,&quot; he said. &quot;When you reach that 50k, that will trigger all those serial pledgers who think &apos;this is worth backing&apos;, and then you can have all the stretch pledges that will take you to 100k.&quot; He also said if he was to run a Kickstarter campaign again, he wouldn&apos;t have any pledges over 100 in value. &quot;The amount of griefing that goes on for the higher value pledges just isn&apos;t worth the amount of money it brings in,&quot; he said. &quot;The vast majority of your money from Kickstarter comes from tiers lower than 100.&quot;",

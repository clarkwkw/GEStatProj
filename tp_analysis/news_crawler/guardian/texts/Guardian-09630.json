    "text": "What&apos;s your favourite piece of technology, and how has it improved your life?It&apos;s got to be the satnav, and it&apos;s improved my life because I don&apos;t get lost any more. I was always terrible at reading maps  I didn&apos;t even know if I was holding it the right way up or not. When was the last time you used it, and what for?To find my way to the Prince Charles Theatre in Leicester Square for the premiere of Red Dwarf X. What additional features would you add if you could?I would love Basil Fawlty to be the voice of my satnav. It would be great if you could get celebrity characters doing satnav voices. Imagine having Rimmer doing your satnav for you ... Do you think it will be obsolete in 10 years&apos; time?I don&apos;t think so, I think it&apos;s here to stay. I think maps are dead, I think maps will be obsolete in 10 years. I do Google Earth and all that kind of stuff now. I actually went on a history tour of all the houses I used to live in growing up, and there&apos;s perfect pictures of them. There&apos;s one where there&apos;s someone in a bedroom window upstairs. I think that&apos;s really kind of creepy, in a way. You can stalk people from the comfort of your own living room. What always frustrates you about technology in general?That I left school the year our school got its first computer, so I&apos;ve never been very computer literate at all. In fact, I&apos;m no good on them. If I have to do something, my 14-year-old daughter generally shows me what I&apos;ve got to do. And the fact that she&apos;s so computer-savvy, and she can type like 135 words a minute  I just get completely lost with it. Is there any particular piece of technology that you have owned and hated?I did have a ZX81 computer that we used for video games. It never worked  it never loaded, it never did anything, it was absolutely awful. If you had one tip about getting the best out of new technology, what would it be?Read the instructions! Do you consider yourself to be a luddite or a nerd?I&apos;m a luddite, a definite luddite. I wish I wasn&apos;t, but I am. Although you do see pensioners and people like that now going on computer courses and learning how to do things. My wife often encourages me, saying: &quot;Why don&apos;t you go on a little course so that you&apos;re more comfortable around this technology?&quot; Why do that when you&apos;ve got people who&apos;ll do it for you? Mac or PC, and why?I can&apos;t use the Mac at all. We had PCs in the green room at Coronation Street, and I can generally get on to Google, and look up something on YouTube  I&apos;m not completely useless. But I can&apos;t use the Mac at all. I&apos;m going to have to get a few lessons on the Mac from my 14-year-old. Robot butlers  a good idea or not?Absolutely brilliant idea  I want one. What piece of technology would you most like to own?A Bugatti Veyron. Two  one for the week and one for Sunday best  Craig Charles has, for almost 25 years, played Dave Lister on the sci-fi sitcom Red Dwarf. The new series, Red Dwarf X, is currently airing on digital channel Dave and will be out on Blu-ray and DVD from 19 November",

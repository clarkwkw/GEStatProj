    "text": "     In case you haven&apos;t seen it yet, here&apos;s the new trailer for Halo 4, produced by Hollywood&apos;s David Fincher and directed by Tim Miller. It&apos;s a two-minute backstory for lead character Master Chief, with a few glimpses of the new aliens he&apos;ll be facing in the latest title.  We&apos;re seeing lots more of these cinematic teasers, with both film and game footage, but it&apos;s especially relevant here as Microsoft is accompanying the release of the sci-fi shooter with an episodic live-action series, Forward Unto Dawn. Anyway, have a look and see if it gets you all excited for the release on 6 November.",

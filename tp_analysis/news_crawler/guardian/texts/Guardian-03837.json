    "text": "This week on Science Weekly, Claudia Hammond talks to Ian Sample about how we perceive the passage of time, the subject of her new book Time Warped: Unlocking the Mysteries of Time Perception. From body temperature to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Claudia reveals how our calculation of time can be affected by a range of physical and mental conditions. Alok Jha is joined by two fans of science geekdom, Mark Henderson author of The Geek Manifesto: Why Science Matters, and Angela Saini, author of Geek Nation: How Indian Science is Taking Over the World.  Angela and Mark discuss why science geeks are valued in India but not in the UK and the possibility of a &quot;geek vote&quot; to lobby for change. They will host a debate entitled &quot;In defence of geeks&quot; on 19 May at the Bristol Festival of Ideas. Angela and Mark also review some of this week&apos;s science news including the Royal Society of Chemistry&apos;s first woman president Professor Lesley Yellowlees and her comments that the UK is half a century behind the US in terms of opportunities for women scientists, and the latest in the debate about open access to scientific research.

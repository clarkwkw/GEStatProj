    "text": "   Professor Jeremy Farrar, who takes over as director of the Wellcome Trust in October 2013    April has brought with it a mini-reshuffle of some of the biggest jobs in British science. Three weeks into his new role, Sir Mark Walport is already stamping his mark on the Government Office for Science. Imran Khan has traded the cramped but energetic office of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE) for a plusher berth at the British Science Association. Earlier this week, Sarah Main, a molecular biologist with experience at the Medical Research Council and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, was named as Khan&apos;s successor at CaSE. And yesterday, Jeremy Farrar, professor of tropical medicine and global health at Oxford University was unveiled as the new director of the Wellcome Trust.  With Wellcome now the world&apos;s third largest charitable foundation, dispensing around 700 million each year, Farrar&apos;s appointment has sparked particular interest. His move to Wellcome&apos;s headquarters in Euston will be a sharp contrast to the seventeen years he has spent as head of Oxford&apos;s Wellcome-funded Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. Given Wellcome&apos;s emphasis on long-term investment in world-class researchers, it&apos;s a characteristic move to appoint one of their own top scientists to the director role, and a sign of the growing maturity of their funding strategy. Farrar&apos;s track record at the frontiers of infectious disease research, including extensive work on H5N1 avian flu, makes his appointment feel remarkably timely, as the world nervously monitors the progress of the current H7N9 outbreak in China, which as of yesterday had infected 108 people and led to 22 deaths. Indeed, with serendipitous timing, on the same day that Farrar&apos;s appointment was announced, the journal Nature published a thoughtful commentary on H7N9 by Peter Horby, one of his close colleagues in Vietnam.  Farrar&apos;s background has led some to speculate that he may further scale up Wellcome&apos;s investment in biomedical research in the developing world. But he will also have to grapple with dilemmas closer to home. As the largest non-governmental funder of research within the UK system, Wellcome has an increasingly powerful voice in science policy, particularly at a time when the research councils are braced for several more years of flat cash funding, and ever tighter scrutiny of their budgets by the bean counters in HM Treasury (as Steven Hill described on this blog yesterday). With a fat, healthy endowment, and no political overlords to answer to, Wellcome can provide a strong, independent perspective on the broader health of the UK&apos;s research system. In the run-up to the last general election, it produced an influential analysis of the economic case for investing in biomedical research. It is now in the process of updating this work, but it will be interesting to see whether Farrar uses his position to play a more prominent role in funding debates ahead of the next general election. In the most extreme scenario, Wellcome could even threaten to divert a proportion of its funding away from the UK if flat or declining public investment is seen to be weakening the overall sustainability of its research and innovation system.  During his decade in charge, Sir Mark Walport skilfully deployed the trust&apos;s financial clout to advance distinctive policy positions on genomics, translational research, open access, open data and science education. It will be intriguing to see how Farrar builds on these foundations, and which new agendas he moves to the fore. This recent interview on the BBC World Service gives a few insights into Farrar&apos;s likely concerns. Perhaps unique among UK institutions, Wellcome has the funding muscle to make or break entire research fields. For example, in their recent book on the &apos;promethean promises of the new biology&apos;, Hilary and Steven Rose, describe the crucial role that Wellcome played in the Human Genome Project:   &quot;Without the massive financial intervention of Wellcome, sometimes spoken of as the ten-thousand-pound gorilla in the genomics room, it is far from clear that the public project would have been driven through.&quot;  From October, when he takes the reins, Jeremy Farrar will have the money (14.5 billion at the last count), a unique platform, and a crack team of staff to draw on (including seasoned pros like Ted Bianco, Clare Matterson and David Lynn, and more recent star signings like Mark &quot;Geek Manifesto&quot; Henderson). But with all that power comes heightened responsibility. And an organisation that has proved impressively effective, but hasn&apos;t always needed to be as transparent and accountable as its public counterparts, will have to keep pace with the demands and expectations of scientists, policymakers, the media and the public.

    "text": "Here&apos;s a message to schools: please help us build a picture on results day of how students around the country have done in their A-level and GCSE exams. As well you know, A-level results day is 16 August, and students are more anxious than ever to get the grades they need to take up their offers at the universities of their choice. And a week later, on 23 August, GCSE results come out. Every year, the Guardian asks schools to tell us all about their A-level and GCSE exam successes. We&apos;d like schools to respond to a few quick questions as soon as possible  on the morning the results come out. Simply go to these web addresses and click on the red button to fill in your school&apos;s results on 16 and 23 August  no special login is needed. We will have a team monitoring scores for reliability. www.theguardian.com/education/a-levels/resultswww.theguardian.com/education/gcses/results If you click through before the results days, you&apos;ll see how grades were plotted on a map of the UK last year, based on the information schools sent in. Here are the questions we will be asking you about A-levels Please note: do not include general studies, BTecs or AS-levels 1. Is your school is a comprehensive, grammar, special school, sixth-form college, further education college, selective independent or non-selective independent school? 2. How many candidates took A-levels this year? 3. How many entries for A-levels were there at your school? 4. Please state what percentage of entries were A and A*? 5. Please tell us any success stories you would like to highlight. Here are the questions we will be asking you about GCSEs and iGCSEs Please note: schools do not need to distinguish between GCSEs and iGCSEs, but please do not include BTecs or OCR nationals 1. Is your school a comprehensive, grammar, special school, sixth-form college, further education college, selective independent or non-selective independent school? 2.

If you have any problems with filling in your school&apos;s score, you can email us at education.results@theguardian.com Help with Clearing Do let your A-level students know that those who don&apos;t do quite as well as they expected on 16 August need not despair. The new Guardian Students site will offer them plenty of advice to see them through the stress of clearing  the process that allows universities to offer their remaining vacancies to students who still need places.  We&apos;ll kick off with a live webchat with the admissions service Ucas the day before the results come out, and we&apos;ll have another on the day itself. Good luck, and let us know how it goes  we&apos;ll be waiting to hear from you.",

Courses will start, professors will once again grumble about teaching commitments, and campuses will swell with an influx of undergraduates, new and returning.  And in this country, scientists will feverishly start scrambling to get their grants written, because in Canada, September is Grant Season. In our biomedical sciences landscape, the biggest player is the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), similar to the UK&apos;s Medical Research Council, or the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), but many other agencies and foundations also have autumn deadlines. Perhaps I&apos;m fortunate in that I&apos;m not an independent, &quot;Principal Investigator&quot; researcher, meaning that I largely don&apos;t have to teach, and I usually don&apos;t write my own grants. A big piece of what I spend my days doing is helping other scientists get their applications in shape, and even more importantly, helping to run a core facility to help them get their experiments done. It&apos;s a slightly unusual niche for a career scientist  not an independent researcher, not a lecturer, but more like running a small-to-medium sized biotechnology company that happens to be not-for-profit. The core facility concept is a simple one. Typically, government funding lets the facility buy equipment, hire and train personnel to operate it, and sustain it over a long period of time, meaning that individual researchers don&apos;t have to. When done right, this saves money  by ensuring that there isn&apos;t duplication of expensive equipment, by creating a critical mass of highly skilled and experienced personnel, and by allowing for economies of scale. One large lab, in theory, has better purchasing power than many small ones.     Photograph: Richard F Wintle    My own field is genomics, the study of the DNA in the body&apos;s cells: how it is inherited, how changes in the genes contained within it can cause disease, and how it varies between people. Scientists around the world send us, or other facilities like ours, samples of DNA, and we run the experiments, generate data, and send it back.  Our team of 90 or so includes laboratory technologists with all manner of technical skills, computer programmers and systems support personnel, statisticians, bioinformaticians, and even an ethics consultant. It&apos;s a good bet that somewhere in that group, we have the right expertise to help out just about anybody who approaches us.  We may be located in a children&apos;s hospital, but anything with DNA is fair game. In recent memory, we&apos;ve sequenced DNA for scientists at Newfoundland&apos;s Memorial University who study appetite regulation in the winter flounder, an apparently delicious flatfish from our east coast. We&apos;ve used high throughput, &quot;next-generation&quot; sequencing instruments to help National Research Council researchers analyse what lives in diesel-contaminated soils from the Canadian high arctic. And yes, we&apos;ve done lots of health-related work, including using &quot;gene chips&quot; for researchers interested in immune responses in HIV-resistant sex workers in Kenya. These may be outside our own research interests, but DNA is DNA, and if it can be isolated, we can probably do something useful with it. It&apos;s not just genomics that can be outsourced. In the UK, the MRC supports a diverse set of resources and services. Whether it be imaging to examine the structure of the brain, mass spectrometry to tease apart the identities of proteins found in the blood, electron microscopes to look at really, really small structures inside a cell, or statistical analysis to help make sense of complex data and understand what it all means  a core facility with focused expertise can really help individual researchers to get their research done. All of this, of course, costs money, in amounts that can seem huge. As an example, earlier this year, Gregory Farber of the US National Center for Research Resources and Linda Weiss of the National Cancer Institute, summarised the NIH&apos;s approach in a freely available article in the journal Science Translational Medicine. They note that the NIH spends a staggering $900m each year on core facilities  a figure that seems enormous, until you consider how many scientists might benefit from these investments.  In comparison, our own facility recently received $5.1m from Genome Canada to support two years of operations. Based on our data from previous years, well over 800 different scientists&apos; labs from around the world will ask us to do work for them over this two-year period, typically resulting in over one hundred published studies per year that acknowledge our facility. Just imagine the impact the larger investments by the NIH, MRC, and other agencies have in enabling scientists to do research. Part of running a successful core facility, of course, is customer service, and in this case our &quot;customers&quot; are scientists, and the coin they use to pay for services is funds from research grants. So as grant season approaches, we do a lot of work in providing expertise in designing experiments, understanding their needs, and advising on which technologies might be best to answer the interesting scientific questions they&apos;re posing.  Often, this means digging through unfamiliar literature to better understand their fields, which can be both educational (remember the winter flounder?  I&apos;d never heard of it before), and at times confusing (I&apos;m still not sure what all those micro-organisms living in the arctic soil are). But if we do this correctly, the process should be pain-free for the client: the sample comes in to the facility, and some time later, the data come out. It should be cheaper than researchers tooling up to do it by themselves, and the data should be of uniformly high quality. When it&apos;s done right, it may also be completely invisible to the public, who may never know that money from their taxes is buying much more efficient research than would otherwise be possible.",

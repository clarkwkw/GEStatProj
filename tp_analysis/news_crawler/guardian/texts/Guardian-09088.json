    "text": "Choosing where to live at university can seem like a minefield of tricky decisions with the potential to make or break a student experience  catered or non-catered, town or campus, large flat or small, ensuite or shared bathroom? Vivienne Robinson, accommodation manager at Newcastle University, advises new students not to sweat the small stuff: &quot;Provided you can afford the accommodation, try not to get too fixated on one specific residence  you&apos;ll have a great student experience at whichever site you&apos;re allocated to.&quot; That said, it&apos;s not a choice to take lightly. Research, says Robinson, is key; find out all that you can on university websites, in brochures and, ideally, on visit days. Bear in mind that photography can be misleading, and there&apos;s really no substitute for seeing the rooms for yourself. Narrow down the big questions first. Mixed-gender accommodation isn&apos;t for everyone, and if you&apos;d rather stick with your own sex, that might make your decision for you. Keep your budget in mind  ensuite bathrooms and proximity to university will push prices up. If you couldn&apos;t bear to share a bathroom with strangers but it wouldn&apos;t phase you to get a bus into lectures every morning, then you know what toprioritise. When it comes to catering, cost is less of an issue, explains Robinson, as there will likely be little difference in price between buying your own food and paying for it inclusively. Instead, go with what appeals to you more  catered students don&apos;t have to worry about grocery shopping, cooking or all the extra cleaning, which can be a blessing for those with heavy timetables or during exam time. But for students with dietary requirements or who particularly enjoy cooking, self-catered is a great, flexible option. Standards Try not to listen to horror stories about the state of university accommodation. Yes, the quality does vary across the board, but all halls of residence have to meet a national code (UUK or ANUK), so you&apos;re assured of a certain standard. Besides, there are plenty of advantages university accommodation has over privately renting in your first year. It&apos;s where you&apos;ll forge your first friendships with other students, and most will have facilities onsite  anything from a laundry room and a vending machine to bars and recreation rooms. Most universities offer an inclusive rent, which makes it easier to budget as you won&apos;t suddenly be hit by a whopping great electricity bill just as the student loan is running dry. Importantly, for most students it&apos;s the first time they&apos;ve moved away from home, so it&apos;s nice to know that there&apos;s always security on hand or a friendly ear close by.",

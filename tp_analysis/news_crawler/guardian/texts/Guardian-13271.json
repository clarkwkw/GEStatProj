    "headline": "Dear Mr Gove: Michael Rosen's letter from a curious parent", 
    "text": "I see that the education select committee has asked you and your permanent secretary to reappear before them. I was surprised by your response: you seem to think that this is a waste of time. You wrote to the committee saying you were free to answer their questions: &quot;Then, perhaps, the Department for Education team can get on with improving children&apos;s lives and you can consider where your own energies might be directed.&quot; I had no idea that it was your job to tell the select committee what they should be doing. Isn&apos;t the idea of you telling others about how their &quot;own energies might be directed&quot; laughable? I&apos;ve been in several parts of the country that are reeling from the chaos of your top-down transformation of the structure of education. As was predicted, an academy can fail an Ofsted inspection. The problem is that you seem to think that turning a school into an academy is a cure and, following from that, you don&apos;t seem to have imagined a scenario in which the cure could fail or that the cure itself might ever need curing. So what happens when an academy fails? Presumably, as your &quot;energies&quot; are &quot;directed&quot; towards this by the red light flashing on the map in your office, you as sole commander of Academy England issue instructions: &quot;Switch sponsors! Chuck out AET, bring in Harris! Hang on, I sent Harris to that other place. How about a superhead? Any superheads around? No? Why not? No one wants to apply for the job? Tell the head in the next-door school, she&apos;s got to do the job or she&apos;s out on her ear. Federate! &quot;Now you&apos;re telling me that if she becomes superhead the deputy head doesn&apos;t want to be a stand-in head? OK, this is the plan: who&apos;s the local authority? Right, this might be tricky, but I want you to sidle up to them, tell them that I&apos;ve never been against local authorities and see if they can ... er ... provide some assistance to this academy ...&quot; Meanwhile, out there beyond the walls of your office, I can tell you that people are seriously confused about the fact that there isn&apos;t just one kind of academy  there appear to be several different kinds. I only have nine years of tertiary education to my name, so I&apos;m not able to understand the structures that you&apos;ve put in place with your well-directed &quot;energies&quot;. I haven&apos;t got any further than thinking that there are: old academies, opted-in academies and Govean you-must-be-academies-because-I-say-so academies. To which must be added the still-academies-even-though-they-failed-Ofsted academies. Perhaps at some point you&apos;ll stand before us and let us know how this &quot;improves children&apos;s lives&quot;. Looking even closer, we can now see what happens when one of your favoured academy sponsors, on your instruction, takes over a local authority school. Let&apos;s home in on a school whose parents, staff, local council and local MP all wanted it to remain under local authority control; a school where the Ofsted inspection showed it performed better than average for its least-able pupils. In came the Govean sponsors who have sent out letters to the parents saying: &quot;Unfortunately, your child has still not met their initial target of being able to recognise their numerals 1-10.&quot; Fair enough, people might say. Children must be able to recognise numbers, eh? One problem: this letter went to parents of four-year-olds. Does telling these parents a) that their children have failed b) that four-year-olds should have numeracy targets c) that this is their target as opposed to the academy sponsor&apos;s target, &quot;improve children&apos;s lives&quot;? This is a point of arrival. You alone decide that a school will become an academy. This joins it to a system that cannot cater for all children. Through the league tables it enforces competition between schools, which results in teaching to the test. Teachers, parents and children are controlled by targets, with the ultimate result that large numbers of children are marked asfailures. But where do these targets come from? Where is the theory and evidence to show that every four-year-old should have targets; should recognise numerals; or that demanding this &quot;improves children&apos;s lives&quot;? No, I&apos;ll rephrase that: where is the discussion about how four-year-olds learn that you and your department could start, as opposed to this kind of Gove-enforced, sponsor-directed instruction?",

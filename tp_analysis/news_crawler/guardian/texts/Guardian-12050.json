    "text": "Last year more than one fifth of the UK&apos;s postgraduate students were enrolled on business and administrative courses, making it one of the most popular areas of postgraduate study. The masters of business administration (MBA) offers intensive training in managerial and technical skills. Many people see it as a fast track to promotion for those whose careers have plateaued. Students are offered the chance to grow a network of industry contacts through alumni and develop specialisms in areas such as global energy or sustainability. But with some programmes costing as much as 57,500, many will question whether MBAs are worth the tuition fees. If you&apos;re considering enrolling on an MBA course but aren&apos;t sure if it&apos;s right for you, don&apos;t fear. From 1-3pm on Tuesday we&apos;ll be joined by representatives from business schools across the country. They&apos;ll be able to answer your questions about finding the perfect course, making an application and securing financial support.

    "text": "The hype is hard to believe. This game, says the hype, is going to be one of the all-time great things. Right up there in the top 10, ever. Maybe just behind the multiple orgasm, but somewhere in front of both the fresh bacon sandwich and the feeling of brand new socks. This, insists the hype, is the game the world&apos;s been waiting for: the war game to end all war games. It&apos;s hype that, surely, nothing could ever possibly live up to. Least of all a mere first-person shooting game. Right? For the few remaining uninitiated, Call of Duty: Black Ops II (Xbox 360 / PS3 / Wii U / PC) is the latest instalment of the biggest franchise in town. Its predecessor, Call of Duty: Black Ops, sold more than 23m copies, and the sequel will be looking to eclipse it. For a franchise that began with three games set in the familiar history of the second world war, and made its name with the transition to modern warfare, Black Ops II, which fast-forwards the action to 2025, is a fairly radical departure from what came before. The story centres on the apocalyptic machinations of a messianic Nicaraguan super-terrorist, the mysterious Raul Menendez, and the attempts of troubled special forces badass David Mason  the son of the previous game&apos;s protagonist  to track him down, figure out his plan and stop him from unleashing his own personal brand of hell. Which, unfortunately for Mason, and very fortunately for us players, involves having to kill a few hundred people in various locations across the world, and, in flashback missions, across a sizeable chunk of the past 50 years. Plus a lot of other cool stuff besides  and not all of it violent. The second mission, for example, begins with Mason and his Navy SEAL buddy dropping from a helicopter to a jungle clifftop on a stormy night in Burma, and leaping off the cliffs in bat-like wing-suits to fly, through a series of lush ravines, to a ruined temple with a large mercenary army camped outside. That&apos;s not a cut-scene. That&apos;s how you, the player, begin the mission: flying. From there, the assault on the temple is a showcase of the futuristic setting&apos;s new tricks. Among them invisible enemies using cloaking devices disabled with EMP grenades, dog-like patrolling sentry drones, hackable heat-seeking cannons and the millimetre wave scanner, a rifle sight that shows the outline of enemies on the other side of walls. It&apos;s not just a load of new guns and gadgets either. The storytelling too has taken a bold leap forward. Where previous games were tightly plotted action blockbusters  cinematic but entirely on rails  Black Ops II offers the player choices with a real effect on future missions and the outcome of the campaign. If they&apos;d been courting the pretentious gamer demographic, they could have called it Postmodern Warfare. Choice is also at the heart of the multiplayer experience, with the new Pick 10 create-a-class system, which ditches the old primary weapon, secondary weapon, grenades and three perks system in favour of the freedom  within limits  to stock up on perks and start with just one gun, or stock up on guns and start with fewer perks. The other major change is the shift to scorestreaks instead of killstreaks, a variation on Modern Warfare 3&apos;s system. Rather than calling in air support after carefully racking up kills, players are encouraged to get stuck in with objectives and work together. Capture enough flags and you could even, in theory, unlock a helicopter without firing a single shot. And of course it&apos;s not just helicopters: the long list of unlockable rewards includes handheld mini-guns, hovering machine gun drones, stealth bombers and the ever-popular pack of angry dogs. The multiplayer maps are the usual mix of bloodbath-friendly bottle-necks and wide open sniper&apos;s playgrounds, with a couple of early stand-outs. Cargo  a Singapore dockyard complete with moving crates on cranes  ensures guaranteed non-stop action, while Express  an LA bullet train station  has a nasty surprise in store for any player daft enough to loiter on the tracks when the ground starts rumbling. Factor in a bigger-than-ever return for the beloved Zombies survival mode, full, free access to the competitive Elite network, and new levels of customisation, variety and replayability, and Black Ops II may just about be bold and badass enough to live up to that impossible hype. Multiple orgasms better watch out.",

    "headline": "The Friday question: which HD remakes would YOU like to see?", 
    "text": "How do we all feel about HD remakes? The whole idea of re-packaging, re-mastering and re-selling classic titles sounds like the sort of cynical exercise we should all be wary of. It is a profitable idea nicked straight from the music industry, where the re-issuing of back catalogue wares has become a standard money-spinner.  ...and yet, I was hugely excited about the Ico and Shadow of the Colossus remakes, because I knew they would introduce these astonishing titles to a new audience. I also wholeheartedly support Just Add Water&apos;s restoration of Stranger&apos;s Wrath, because this fascinating offbeat adventure title was horrendously overlooked on its original Xbox release. So anyway, assuming we don&apos;t mind the occasional, tastefully produced HD remake, which titles would you like to see re-animated for 2012? I think it&apos;s got to be about games that will truly benefit from a boost in graphical performance, rather than just retro titles that we quite like. And maybe it should be titles that you feel were over-looked and that could be re-appraised in the era of the PS3 and Xbox 360. With those rules in mind, here are two suggestions to get us started: Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (Crystal Dynamics, PlayStation, 1999)This atmospheric action-adventure followed a withered wraith named Raziel on his journey through the apocalyptic kingdom of Nosgoth, battling vampires and demons, and solving intricate environmental puzzles. The game allows you to slip between the living and the spirit realms  an ingenious mechanic that forces you to think in two simultaneous dimensions. The grand gothic locations would look stunning on PS3 or Xbox 360, and Uncharted fans would get the chance to experience an early work by designer Amy Hennig, who clearly brought some of Soul Reaver&apos;s sense of epic scale to the Nathan Drake series.Shenmue (Sega, Dreamcast, 1999)I am, of course, not alone in yearning for the return of this epoch-shattering action adventure. It broke so many rules of game design and made so many more up  and yet it must now be left to wither and fade; another example of Dreamcast&apos;s legacy being written out of history. But imagine a shiny new HD remake, imagine Ryo wandering through a re-mastered Yokosuka. This bloated, brilliant game would be magisterial on a modern console. It was ahead of its time and we didn&apos;t deserve it. We do now, perhaps. Over to you...",

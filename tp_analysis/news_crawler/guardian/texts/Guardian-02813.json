    "text": "A dozen or so ponies are grazing where the single-track road begins to rise as it makes its way over the island to Acarsaid Mhor. Most are pulling at the rough grass growing on the rocky slope, while a little farther away a smaller group is picking at the shorter roadside turf. One is not grazing at all but is standing, apparently half asleep, in the middle of the road. All of the ponies bar two are greys, and all have the slightly unkempt look of hardy animals in their winter coats. They are attractive animals with full manes and tails, strong-bodied and neat-footed. The coats of the greys are variously marked, some with strong dappling on the quarters, others with a mere suggestion of darker colouring. One by one, as they become aware of my scrutiny, they lift their heads and turn a mildly curious, dark-eyed gaze in my direction. It&apos;s a rather strange sensation to be the focus of their regard for, although their coats are different, the faces turned towards me are eerily similar. With their long, fine features, they are handsome rather than pretty, possessing the sort of good looks one expects not in a pony but in a horse. But these are most definitely ponies, Eriskay ponies. Strong for their size, mild-mannered and hard-working, in their time Eriskay ponies had been invaluable on the croft, but as the use of machinery increased so their numbers dwindled  until, by the early 1970s, there were just 20 remaining. Only the determined efforts of a group of local people who did not wish to see this native breed die out brought them back from the edge of extinction. As the ponies up on the hillside drop their heads and return to their grazing, I resume my walk. The little group farther along the road stretch out their necks, snuffling the air as I approach and huffing sweet-scented equine breath into the afternoon as I pass.",

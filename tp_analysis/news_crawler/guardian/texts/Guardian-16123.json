    "text": "   Photograph: supplied    I chose not to apply for funding. I&apos;m researching the ways in which popular music functions in film from the release of A Hard Day&apos;s Night (1964) to that of Saturday Night Fever (1977), and after thoroughly investigating the funding available for my area of research, it soon became apparent that the possibility of gaining any financial assistance for my studies was almost non-existent. I fund myself through running my own part-time accountancy business. I am fortunate to have a very understanding partner who is extremely supportive of me pursuing this academic route rather than paying off our mortgage more quickly. However, it has still been necessary for me to restrict my studies to a part-time basis owing to the costs of full-time fees. New challenges My decision to study film came from a desire for a new challenge totally unconnected with my work. I&apos;d combined my business with looking after my daughter who has now grown up and I was finding myself with an increased amount of free time. So, at the age of 45, I returned to full-time education and completed a degree at the University of the West of England, attaining a first. I enjoyed the experience and was keen to pursue my areas of interest in greater depth. After a year out I applied to the University of Gloucestershire. On the whole, I&apos;ve not struggled with motivation as I consider myself very lucky to be able to dedicate my time to something I have chosen to do. The university provides opportunities to raise awareness of my work through the symposiums and a profile page on their website. However, for me, a sense of personal self-achievement is more gratifying than wider academic recognition, though it is satisfying when others take an interest in my work. The strongest reactions I have encountered from being self-funded are from those external to the higher education system. When I explain to others what I am doing, this is usually met with one of two reactions. The first is, &quot;I wish I could do that&quot;, though enthusiasm wanes when the level of fees is disclosed and they learn that research involves a little more than watching films and saying why you liked or disliked them. The second is &quot;what a waste of my taxes&quot;, which changes after I explain that I pay my own fees. And thirdly, &quot;what a waste of money&quot;. It seems that many people are unable to see beyond my subject matter and cannot appreciate the skills acquired in completing a PhD, regardless of the topic researched. I believe this attitude may extend to those providing funding at this level. Advice for others I would advise anybody considering enrolling on a PhD to explore all avenues for funding prior to applying. It is also worth adapting a research proposal to increase funding options available. If, as in my case, this cannot be done, consider the potential benefits of studying part-time. Pursuing this option and devoting the additional free time to paid work and further research may both provide an additional income and reduce overall fees. Finally, pick a subject which not only interests you now, but is likely to do so for many years to come.

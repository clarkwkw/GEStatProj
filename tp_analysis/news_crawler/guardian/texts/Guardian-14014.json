For full story see final section below    Nesta has published two papers on the mutual influence of science fiction and innovation. It&apos;s been great fun working with the authors: busting the myth that science fiction predicts future technologies; exploring what stories tell us about public attitudes to technology; and finding out about the latest trends for collaborative writing, design and experiments speculating about the future. Check out the original papers here and here.  This is Lydia Nicholas&apos; take on what they said -  Imagine a new future. No, not that tired old vision of hoverboards and robot butlers: something really new and truly strange. It&apos;s hard. It&apos;s harder still to invent the new things that will fill this entirely new world. New ideas that do not fit or that come from unfamiliar places are often ignored. Hedy Lemarr and George Antheil&apos;s frequency-hopping patent was ignored for 20 years because the US Navy could not believe that Hollywood artists could invent a method of secure communication. Many of Nikola Tesla&apos;s inventions and his passionate belief in the importance of renewable energy were ignored by a world that could not imagine a need for them.  Stories open our eyes to the opportunities and hazards of new technologies. By articulating our fears and desires for the future, stories help shape what is to come - informing public debate, influencing regulation and inspiring inventors. And this makes it important that we do not just listen to the loudest voices. Of course it isn&apos;t as simple as mining mountains of pulp sci-fi for the schematics of the next rocket or the algorithms of the next Google. Arthur C. Clarke, often attributed with the invention of the communication satellite, firmly believed that these satellites would require crews. The pervasive connectivity that defines our world today would never have existed if every satellite needed to be manned.  Invention is often a process of making real what we already dream of. Skype relies on an extraordinarily complex infrastructure to let us see and hear our distant loved ones, but it seems entirely natural because this connection is something we have always wanted. Letters and telegrams and phones are evidence of the same longing, gradually brought into reality. Before these we saw each other in dreams and crystal balls. In 18th Century versions of Beauty and the Beast, the lovers already face-timed over a portable magic mirror. We are driven to create new, better worlds in our stories, and in our laboratories. There is a basic human desire to imagine the future and change the world to try and reach that dream. Science fiction is particularly deliberate and direct in its engagement with the future. Many inventions have cross over from science fiction to fact and back again. Worlds created in films and books are absorbed into our culture and play a role in debates about current science, as well as feeding the scientific imagination about what is possible. A deeper interrogation of this process - as is found in these Nesta papers  offers an invaluable in understanding these public debates about science and technology. For an example of how complex things can get, what better place to start than the humble book?  Undoubtedly Man will learn to make synthetic rubber more cheaply, undoubtedly his aircraft will fly faster, undoubtedly he will find more specific poisons to destroy his internal parasitesbut what can he do to mechanically to improve the book?   [Vannevar Bush, Mechanization and the Record, 1939] Many mid-20th Century attempts to predict the future of the book were wildly inaccurate and unnecessarily complicated. (See the wonderful 1959 dream of an electronic home library at the top of this article.) If the next technology was to project microfilm on the ceiling while listening over headphones, then most people were happy to stick with cheap, portable, sliced tree. The electronic book in and out of fiction     An Electronic Home Library imagined in a 1959 newspaper    In 1971 Douglas Adams lay drunk in an Austrian field looking up at the night sky, holding a battered copy of Hitchhikers&apos; guide to Europe and thought that somebody really should write a guide to the galaxy. Somewhere between this thought and the radio show The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy broadcast in 1978, Adams imagined a kind of slim, portable, electronic thing which stored thousands of articles, images, video and audio with location awareness and an interface so elegant a mere human could understand it. By the Mark II version described in So Long and Thanks For All The Fish, The Guide was personalised using data from its user, and (in some versions of the book) the data it collected and the advice it so conveniently offered was manipulated by its programmers for commercial goals. The similarity to current devices and concerns is astonishing and not coincidental. Before The Guide and the iPad, tablet computers had already appeared in popular culture. Asimov put a calculator pad in Foundation in 1951, and Arthur C. Clarke thought up the Newspad, which then appeared in Stanley Kubrick&apos;s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Guide brought these problems together. Adams did not merely expand the idea of the book, but transformed it into a complete guide to life: an assistant that renders a whole galaxy of new worlds understandable to the baffled everyman Arthur Dent.  Adams was an active participant in the development of new forms of books and media. In the first Dot Com boom he founded The Digital Village and made text adventure games. He collaborated with Voyager, an early and admired multimedia company, to create an expanded book edition of The Guide. He promoted this with a skit on inventing the book &quot;properly&quot;. Adams was also an avowed Apple devotee. He claimed to have bought one of the first three Macs sold in the UK, he met Steve Jobs, and the last words he posted online were in praise of OS X. The link from The Guide to iPad seems obvious. Stephen Fry called it &quot;the closest thing to his Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide that humankind has yet devised&quot;. But the paths of product development and imagination overlapped and stumbled many times before they merged. While Adams became a multimedia producer, Apple created its own fictional versions of The Guide. In 1987 then CEO John Sculley described The Knowledge Navigator - a touchscreen phone and tablet computer with a voice assistant who makes sense of a busy professor&apos;s schedules, messages, and the public and private data available to him. These ideas were included in the Newton Messagepad, launched in 1990. Sculley intended to include a guide service &apos;Newton Intelligence&apos; in the Messagepad, which would anticipate users&apos; behaviour and act on those assumptions. But the technology was not ready. The combination of the $1000 price tag with these broken, unfinished features made the Messagepad a failure. Steve Jobs&apos; return to Apple in 1996 marked a return to principles of mobility, usability and responsiveness, connecting imagination to good design and sticking firmly within the features current technology was capable of doing well. The iPod redesigned storage and access to audio, the iPhone redesigned access to information - from personal communication to maps. In 2010 the iPad launched and owners were able to access The Guide in film, audio and eBook form through iTunes. Does this neat convergence mark the end of the usefulness of The Guide as an idea? Where will we find our next Guide? It is now easier than ever for people to tell and share their stories across a huge variety of platforms. These imaginative resources are not just there for product designers to dig through, but they play a role in shaping public debate, and so have a real influence on our communities and culture. In 1999 Adams launched h2g2, a collaborative online encyclopedia, and opened the creation of The Guide to everyone. Getting more people involved in the process of imagining futures can only help us build a better one.",

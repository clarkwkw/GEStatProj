    "text": "Channel 4&apos;s recent Dogging Tales documentary was a word-of-mouth hit in the UK, thanks partly to word-of-mouth recommendations on Twitter as it aired. Twitter&apos;s head of broadcast partnerships in the UK, Dan Biddle, used the show as a key example of how television can benefit from Twitter buzz in his speech at the MIPCube conference in Cannes, urging broadcasters to &quot;think about programming Twitter as you programme your channel&quot;. Biddle showed tweets from celebrities and normal viewers alike to show how they had reacted to Dogging Tales as it aired. &quot;Twitter went mad,&quot; he said. &quot;People were turning over because the stuff coming out of Twitter was so amusing.&quot; Biddle also praised deodorant brand Lynx for its swift reaction to one of the characters in the documentary&apos;s claim that Lynx was his fragrance of choice when out dogging. Rather than panicking about the negative publicity, the official Lynx Effect Twitter account tweeted &quot;Good choice of fragrance over on @Channel4 - guaranteed to get a bit more attention, whatever the situation..! #DoggingTales&quot; It then followed up the next morning with a spoof photo of Lynx&apos;s social media team holding &quot;crisis meetings&quot; wearing masks similar to the doggers in the documentary.    Crisis meetings all morning thanks to Les in #DoggingTales last night Weve concluded there is no crisis twitter.com/lynxeffect/sta&mdash; The Lynx Effect (@lynxeffect) April 5, 2013    &quot;The key was Lynx was here [on Twitter] and Lynx also found the jokes after the show, and saw this is something we can make something out of,&quot; said Biddle. &quot;Twitter provides that opportunity to reach out and join your audience.&quot; Mobile has been an important part of the Twitter activity around TV shows. Biddle noted that 60% of Twitter&apos;s 200m active users access the service by mobile, but that this percentage stands at 80% in the UK. &quot;40% of tweets in the UK during peak-time television hours are about television. Twitter is the room that we&apos;re watching television in,&quot; said Biddle, who cited chief executive Dick Costolo&apos;s previous claims that Twitter is a reinvention of the town square. &quot;If you imagine that town square, when you&apos;re watching television, Twitter has rolled up the biggest sofa you can imagine, and everyone is sitting on it together.&quot; Much of Biddle&apos;s presentation focused on examples of how British broadcasters and producers have incorporated Twitter into their shows. They spanned the BBC&apos;s Question time launching a second @BBCExtraGuest Twitter account for an offscreen guest to livetweet each episode; ITV2 quoting fans&apos; tweets during the ad breaks for The Only Way is Essex; and Ant and Dec getting followers to suggest their opening poses for each episode of Saturday Night Takeaway. &quot;They get the audience to do stuff before the show, and get people talking about the show before the show, because they see the value in that,&quot; said Biddle. &quot;It&apos;s a really great way of engaging with the audience.&quot; Biddle also suggested broadcasters should display the Twitter username for a show alongside its hashtag on-air &quot;you don&apos;t see the username as often, it&apos;s very strange. If you can get someone to follow you, you can take them across the week, the month&quot; but said the hashtag remains &quot;the campfire around which everybody tells stories&quot;. There is, needless to say, a certain amount of self-interest here. Twitter isn&apos;t the only online destination broadcasters are promoting to their viewers think Facebook pages, official websites, catch-up TV services and more. Biddle&apos;s talk unsurprisingly didn&apos;t give advice on how broadcasters can juggle these different messages, or what kind of interaction works best on the various platforms. Biddle did praise Channel 4 show Hugh&apos;s Fish Fight, a documentary starring Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall which aimed to change the way supermarkets source their fish, and the awareness of their customers. He showed a clip of Fearnley-Whittingstall encouraging his audience to tweet at Tesco, Morrisons and The Co-operative Food using the hashtag #fishfight during an advertising break (&quot;If they won&apos;t talk to me, maybe they&apos;ll talk to you Let&apos;s get #fishfight trending in this commercial break&quot;). Biddle said that this single call to action sparked 16,139 tweets in that commercial break, as part of more than 40k over the course of the day the programme aired. &quot;The show was made more active, and given more sense of &apos;this is what people are doing, people care about this, people are passionate about this&apos;,&quot; he said. Biddle also showed an example of a broadcaster making money from its tweets. ESPN tweets out clips of key moments from college American football games as they air, and partnered with Ford to run short pre-roll ads, with Ford then also paying Twitter to promote the tweets. &quot;This key moment is shareable and spreadable. They [ESPN] know somebody else is going to do it if they don&apos;t, so they might as well be first to market, and have their brand attached to it,&quot; said Biddle. He finished by suggesting that for TV shows that aren&apos;t live, producers and broadcasters should be aware of the moments that may be most popular on Twitter, and plan accordingly. He stressed that this doesn&apos;t involve changing the show itself, but more preparing photos or video clips that can be tweeted as that moment airs. &quot;That&apos;s the sweet spot. That&apos;s the tweet spot,&quot; said Biddle, citing a tweet from the BBC Nature account about an elephant refusing to abandon her dead baby a pivotal moment in one episode in the recent Africa wildlife series.    She won't abandon her baby. #Africa twitter.com/BBCNature/stat&mdash; BBC Nature (@BBCNature) January 9, 2013    &quot;Think about programming Twitter as you programme your channel,&quot; he concluded. &quot;There are patterns of activity around it.&quot; This article was amended on 10 April to reflect the fact that Tesco, not Sainsbury&apos;s, was one of the three supermarkets targeted by the Hugh&apos;s Fish Fight show.",

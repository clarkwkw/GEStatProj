    "text": "As a female founder of a code education and digital enlightenment business, I&apos;m using the eve of International Women&apos;s Day to ask myself how women are faring in the tech revolution. Votes for women, the pill, the arab spring and protests in Delhi all represent milestones in the empowerment of the female population, but the technological revolution must be next. If we embrace the opportunity, this will become a bright, new frontier of unimaginable emancipation and equality. Code is shorthand for the programming languages that are the ingredients for every website, piece of software, game and digital product. It is what goes on behind the screen, powering the internet revolution. Decoded, the code education firm I co-founded, has been teaching professionals from all industries how to code for almost two years. We have seen the response of the public shift from disinterest to an enthusiastic &quot;code  I need to learn&quot;. And to get a sense of the scale of interest in the nuts and bolts of the tech industry, look at Code.org&apos;s learning to code video featuring Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which has racked up 9.5m views in just one week. The awareness, demand and opportunity has never been greater. The opportunity of digital business Google&apos;s Big Tent debate in Brussels last month brought together policy makers and politicians from around the EU. The growth of web-based technology has meant that more than 2.5 million people created their own job by becoming entrepreneurs and helped create more than one million additional paid jobs each year, though efficiencies created by technology are eradicating the need for certain roles and the scale of people needed to grow a global business. But creating work or not, organisational structures and traditional hierarchies are shifting; a small startup like property swap site Airbnb has had lawyers, landlords and hoteliers in disarray, witnessing the power and disruption that an innovative business can wreak on the incumbents in a matter of months. So who are the authors/founders/creators within this revolution? Who are the coders, and the biggest names in the industry? Sadly, it appears they are male. Lady Geek, a campaigning agency making technology more accessible to women, calculates that the number of UK technology jobs held by women has dropped from 22% in 2001 to 17% by 2011 and the number of women applying for computing A-level in the UK dropped from 12% in 2004 to 8% by 2011. Code.org estimates there to be 1 million more computer programming job opportunities than graduates in the US by 2020, and estimate the opportunity cost at $500 billion. So is the digital rulebook, our digital history, being written by men? Are the guys cashing in and the girls losing out? The gender divide in computing Theo Blackwell from Next Gen Skills, the campaign championing the need for computer programming skills in the UK, has observed a national gender divide across science, technology, engineering and maths with girls accounting for as few as 7% of computing A-level students in 2011/2012. Gender aside, the poor take-up of computing in English schools is a broader trend, with student numbers dropping from 12,529 in 1998 to 3,420 in 2012. What impact will that have on the UK&apos;s tech industry? London mayor Boris Johnson pledged to learn to code last year, and a few weeks ago President Obama spoke about the need to teach code in schools. But when will the words turn into action and investment? It is irresponsible of the government to rely on small businesses and struggling not-for-profits to resolve an issue of national importance without robust support. &quot;An understanding of computer science is becoming increasingly essential in today&apos;s world,&quot; Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has said. &quot;Our national competitiveness depends upon our ability to educate our children  and that includes our girls - in this critical field.&quot; New roles combining tech, communication and collaboration Not everyone wants or needs to become a programmer. But the need for basic technical skills and deep digital literacy currently extends to every single role in every industry being influenced by technology. Take for example the role of the creative versus the creative technologist. It&apos;s notoriously hard to get a job as a creative in the industry and the salaries are pretty disheartening when you do. I searched this week online for a job as a creative: 28,000 per annum with around four years&apos; experience. Alongside this was a role for a &apos;creative technologist&apos;, required to be able to code, liaise with clients and knit design, usability and function  salary 70,000. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say that people with technical skills are more valuable than anyone else here,&quot; said Mel Exon of ad agency BBH. &quot;But a deep grasp of technology is becoming more essential across our resource in every department, not less&quot;. There is a hunger and urgent need for hybrid skills, and women seem perfectly placed to command a very powerful position in these emerging roles that require tech and communication skills. I&apos;ve seen professionals from more than 400 different businesses want to learn to code. They span every sector you could possibly imagine. What&apos;s more is they span every possible age, role and hierarchy too. From the 20-year-old graduate looking to make themselves as employable as possible and a woman who has missed a few years bringing up kids, to the FTSE 100 board director. There&apos;s a consensus of feeling lost, overwhelmed and confused by jargon and rapidly changing technology. Technology: evidence the field is levelling &quot;Over the past 40 or 50 years,&quot; according to John Van Reenen, professor at the Department of Economics at the London School of Economics, &quot;the proportion of women in the workplace has gone up, the wage gap has narrowed significantly, the educational gap has been reduced and women are outperforming men across all sectors and industries.&quot; Technology, he argues, has levelled the playing field. What, then, are the real barriers for women embracing tech skills and learning? The stereotypes of programmers are unflattering and largely unappealing, but these stereotypes also reinforce the invisibility of women coders and women in technology more widely. Of women who have recently learnt to code, most could not name a mentor in tech. Facebook&apos;s Sandberg, Yahoo chief executive Marissa Meyer, Mind Candy&apos;s chief operating officer Divinia Knowles and Tech City&apos;s chief executive Joanna Shields are all great examples, but we need more. A positive response to the lack of visibility has been the rise of women-specific tech groups: the Standford-based She++, the global un-conference Geek Girl Meetup, Girls in Tech and Tech Talk Fest in East London. Yet the need for such events prompts frustration even from the most passionate and engaged in the community. &quot;Girl events are rare and can sometimes feel a bit forced,&quot; said one female tech founder. &quot;I spend 95% of my time at events that are meant to be mixed but are 90% male.&quot; The barriers to learning how to code have dramatically decreased in recent years. It has become more accessible, more intuitive, more applicable, speedily grasped and more creatively applied. All Decoded trainees say they feel more confident with their new skills after the course; the only discernible difference with women  who make up 50% of trainees  is they express less confidence, and maybe more honesty about that, before they start. Step on up A handful of pioneering women created the computing revolution, from the world&apos;s first computer programmer of the 1800s, Ada Lovelace, to Austrian-American Hedy Lamarr, Hollywood star and mathematician who invented an early technique for spread spectrum communications and frequency hopping  the basis for WiFi and Bluetooth we use today. Flash-forward to today, and the cost of starting up in tech has dropped from $5m in 1997 to $50,000 in 2008, according to the Wired for Growth and Innovation report in 2012. Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrove says the number of female attendees in the past three years has rocketed from a handful to hundreds  a cohort of highly ambitious educated women in their 20s exploiting lower barriers to tech startups. The opportunities are there. Now we need to encourage and support this new generation, and provide meaningful investment to the next generation of code heroes and rock stars. And let&apos;s make them female ones. Kathryn Parsons is co-founder of Decoded ",

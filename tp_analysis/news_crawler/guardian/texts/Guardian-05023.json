In my neck of the woods, we had a light dusting of snow that lasted for roughly three hours this winter season, and it doesn&apos;t look as though any more is on the way. So if you&apos;re missing snow, here&apos;s a nice little video, courtesy of the Natural History Museum in Tring, of a winter walk around the snowy hills of Tring with museum botanist Fred Rumsey:               Visit NaturalHistoryMuseum&apos;s YouTube channel [video link].

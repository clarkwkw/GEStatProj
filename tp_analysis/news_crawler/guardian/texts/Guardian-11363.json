    "headline": "End selection by religion in schools", 
    "text": "There is increasing public concern over religious selection for state-funded schools (Report, 12 December). A survey has shown that the public oppose such selection by more than four to one and the first ever judicial review against a new school over the issue has been heard at the high court. In our view this discrimination should not continue. Dr James Doyle, Roman Catholic bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, said it eloquently to a parliamentary committee in 1830: &quot;I do not see how any man, wishing well to the public peace, and who looks to Ireland as his country, can think that peace can ever be permanently established, or the prosperity of the country ever well secured, if children are separated at the commencement of life on account of their religious opinions. I do not know any measure which would prepare the way for a better feeling in Ireland than uniting children at an early age, and bringing them up in the same schools, leading them to commune with one another, and to form those little intimacies and friendships which often subsist through life. Children thus united, know and love each other, as children brought up together always will; and to separate them is, I think, to destroy some of the finest feelings in the hearts of men.&quot; We take no common position on the suitability of the state funding of religious schools. But we believe selecting pupils on religious grounds adds to greater segregation. It is also widely regarded as discriminatory and unfair. We urge the government to amend the law to end such selection.Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain Chair, Accord CoalitionDr Mary Bousted General secretary, Association of Teachers and LecturersAndrew Copson Chief executive, British Humanist AssociationTehmina Kazi Director, British Muslims for Secular DemocracyDr Artemi Sakellariadis Director, Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education (CSIE)Simon Barrow and Jonathan Bartley Co-Directors, EkklesiaHolly Dustin Director, End Violence Against Women CoalitionDerek McAuley Chief officer, General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian ChurchesProfessor Ted Cantle Institute of Community Cohesion FoundationFiona Millar Local Schools NetworkChristine Blower General secretary, National Union of TeachersJeremy Rodell Spokesperson, Richmond Inclusive Schools CampaignRob Berkeley Director, Runnymede TrustMelissa Benn Vice-president, Socialist Educational Association",

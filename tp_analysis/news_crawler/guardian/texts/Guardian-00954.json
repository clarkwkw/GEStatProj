    "headline": "HE rationing: we should not limit the number that universities can recruit", 
    "text": "Every crisis contains the potential for change and renewal for some, if not all its victims. Unemployment is exactly such an opportunity and the monthly statistics, tracking its ascension the graph are a regular reminder of how this is being wasted. This week&apos;s figures brought unemployment to a 17 year high, including more than a million young people. At the same time the number of undergraduates universities are allowed to recruit has been reduced by 10,000 since 2009/10 and tens of thousands of qualified candidates will be turned away this year. At the time of writing, universities were still waiting for the grant letter from HEFCE, with the expectation that places will be frozen or even cut again. With barely a third of working adults having qualifications at level four or above, we are missing a historic opportunity to enhance the education and talent of the UK workforce. While some of the people who fail to get HE places this year will have or will get jobs, it is likely that many will be unemployed and getting benefits that would surely be better spent enabling them to fulfil their ambitions. We should be filling those universities and colleges that want to expand to capacity and taking this chance to improve our long term productivity and international competitiveness. It is particularly unjust to deny people the opportunity of further and higher study because the financial penalties for being poorly educated are higher in the UK than the average for OECD (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. The rewards for having a degree are among the highest in the developed world, second only to the US. Graduates in the UK have much higher employment rates than average for the rest of the OECD  while those with poor qualifications are much more likely to be unemployed. So denying people access to further and higher education, when they have the entry qualifications and the desire to study is an issue of individual fairness. The rationing of HE seems even crazier when you consider evidence again from the OECD, suggesting that in the UK that the public benefit that graduates generate through higher income tax and social contributions &quot;far outweigh&quot; the public costs . The OECD estimates that the UK tax payer makes 65,000 for each man and 51,000 for each woman graduate, the seventh highest return on investment in the developed world. Investment in HE really is a win-win proposition. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

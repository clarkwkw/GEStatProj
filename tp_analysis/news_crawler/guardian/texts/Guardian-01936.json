    "text": "Mobile World Congress has started, with delegates already charging around Barcelona&apos;s Fira complex grabbing fistfuls of collectible Android pin-badges once again, Google is gamifying the show, while driving foot traffic to its partners&apos; stands. Savvy showgoers are also stopping in at the stands of Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo and Korean operator SK Telecom, though, to see what new mobile technologies they&apos;re showing off. While some are quirky and unlikely to travel well beyond their domestic markets, others offer a glimpse of what lies ahead in the West. File under quirky NTT DoCoMo&apos;s &quot;mobile infographics&quot; app. It&apos;s a lock-screen application for Android smartphones that represents information including battery life, new emails and texts, and local weather data as an animated picture of a town. Tap on cars driving along the road, and you get a traffic report. Tap on a stadium to get live football scores. It&apos;s a bit like SimCity or Zynga&apos;s CityVille reimagined as a way to deliver information. And yes, there are very few arguments for doing it this way rather than as notification icons on a homescreen. But it&apos;s quite fun nonetheless. More serious is DoCoMo&apos;s Boardwalk mobile ticketing service, which uses NFC technology to buy tickets tapping your smartphone against a poster brings up information on a music concert or event and lets you buy a mobile ticket, with NFC also used to enter the event itself. DoCoMo sold 100m mobile tickets in 2011 using RFID technology and QR codes, but it&apos;s now looking to use NFC and sell Boardwalk to companies outside Japan. Over at SK Telecom&apos;s stand, the early buzz is coming from its Smart Learning section, and some little robots who interact with Android smartphones for educational purposes. I played a game where you tilt the phone to trundle around a map of the world, finding specific countries before the water runs out of a virtual goldfish bowl on-screen. Yes, quirky.     SK Telecom's Smart Learning robots interact with smartphones.

They&apos;re a calling card for SK Telecom&apos;s deeper Smart Learning services, including one called &quot;English Bean&quot;. It&apos;s a cross-platform service for studying English, with students using their mobile phones to access daily reading material and video content within apps and on mobile websites, while also having video calls with their English tutors.  Facebook-connected word games are also part of the service an interesting take on social gaming for the academic sector.  This article was amended on 7 March 2012 because the original headline said NTT DoCoMo and SK Telecom&apos;s NFC tickets, when it should have said NTT DoCoMo and KT&apos;s NFC tickets. This has been corrected.",

    "text": "If you&apos;re buried in the technology industry bubble, it&apos;s easy to think that every company has a full set of APIs for developers to access its data. Step out into the real world, and it&apos;s not true. British startup Datownia is one of the companies trying to tackle this issue. It started life as an internal project for apps agency Release Mobile as a way to make it easier for clients to update data for their apps on different devices. The initial version launched in October after around nine months of development and a &quot;Smart&quot; grant from the UK&apos;s Technology Strategy Board. It works thus: companies sign up for Datownia, then connect it to a Dropbox cloud storage account. They can then upload spreadsheets of data to Dropbox, which Datownia then turns into web-service APIs for developers to make apps. Whenever the data in the Dropbox spreadsheet is updated, it&apos;s also updated in the apps. The idea is to get more businesses and public-sector bodies opening up their data to developers, while demystifying the process of creating APIs to achieve this. &quot;When you ask companies if they have an API, many still ask what it is,&quot; says founder Will Lovegrove. &quot;We found a giant gulf between the big companies and technology startups who tend to have APIs, and everybody else in between, of who 96% literally didn&apos;t know what API meant.&quot; Lovegrove adds that even when these companies know what an API is, they often worry about the cost and complexity of launching their own, especially if it looks like turning into a complex IT integration project requiring outside help. &quot;We want to take the IT consultant out of the question for building a good API for a small business,&quot; he says. &quot;Why can&apos;t we take a spreadsheet, replicate that into the cloud, wrap it around an API and put it into a developer portal?&quot; Users so far include the London Borough of Lambeth, which is building a developer portal of its local authority information; University College London, which also has a developer portal used for its own iPad app and partners; music group PIAS, which is tracking data from its various labels; and Leiths School of Food and Wine, which is using Datownia to update its upcoming iPhone and Android apps simultaneously. Datownia also sponsored the recent UK Parliament Hack Day, building an API full of political data for developers to play with. One resulting hack: MPs Legislative Rainy Day Fun Pack, which scraped weather data from the Wunderground website and compared it to MP voting records data from Datownia to answer the question &quot;Does bad weather affect the voting habits of our MPs?&quot;. It hints at the potential. Lovegrove admits there are challenges for Datownia, including teaching some businesses how to create clean spreadsheets for the service to work, and also educating them in how to keep the data updated without causing problems for apps. &quot;This is no longer about changing data on your laptop we have to educate users in what you can and cannot do,&quot; he says. &quot;You can&apos;t just restructure an Excel doc: you&apos;ll kill someone&apos;s app!&quot; Currently, Datownia is offering a three-month free trial for businesses to upload up to 250MB of data in Excel spreadsheet form. Thereafter, they will choose one of three pricing plans: for individual use, small-to-medium sized businesses, and heavy API use, costing $25 a month, $120 a month and $190 a month respectively. &quot;What we&apos;re betting on really is that at some point in time, every single organisation will have an open data API,&quot; says Lovegrove. &quot;What we&apos;ve delivered is a way for very small organisations to get that done without getting their fingers burnt.&quot;",

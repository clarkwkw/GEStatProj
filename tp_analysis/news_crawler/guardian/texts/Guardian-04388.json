    "text": "It is one of the most &quot;tranquil and unspoilt stretches of the river Thames&quot;, according to the National Trust, a near timeless place that has hardly changed for centuries. To naturalists, Brandy Island on the Oxfordshire-Gloucestershire border is a wilderness, with surrounding water-meadows that are an environmental treasure trove rich in bats, voles, kingfishers and otters. To the designer, artist and writer William Morris it was an &quot;earthly paradise&quot;, an almost sacred place where, at nearby Kelmscott Manor, he would escape the stresses of urban Victorian life. Accompanied by his wife, Jane, and his friends, the Pre-Raphaelite artists Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones, Morris would walk along the willow-lined stretch of the Thames and let nature inspire him. His famous &quot;willow&quot; pattern, an abiding leitmotif of the arts and crafts movement, is said to owe much to his bucolic walks along the riverbank. But there is trouble in paradise. A local company that bought the site  which has been an effective nature reserve for the past two decades  wants to build 20 moorings on the island, allowing boat owners to berth their pleasure craft on one of the most secluded stretches of the river. The move has incensed residents in Buscot, a nearby village that boasts chocolate-box Cotswold stone houses and the GradeI-listed St Mary&apos;s the Virgin church, decorated with Burne-Jones&apos;s stained-glass windows. They claim that the development would lead to increased noise and traffic, and forever change the landscape and tranquillity of the site. &quot;It&apos;s the wrong development in the wrong place,&quot; said Ellen Ann Hopkins, who has lived in Buscot&apos;s old parsonage, a Grade-II listed building, for the past 30 years. &quot;This is one of England&apos;s most treasured landscapes It has to be protected.&quot; It is not just residents who are taking a close interest in the proposed development: there is much at stake. The planning battle is being billed as the first real test of the government&apos;s pledge to protect the open countryside and the interests of local communities. The pledge was made when the government outlined its controversial National Planning Policy Framework, which was attacked by conservationists who claimed that its pro-planning agenda threatened open spaces. Under the new framework, the local Vale of White Horse district council is obliged to take into account the views of local people on the proposed development. But it is also obliged to encourage sustainable development, even in an area that it recognises as &quot;of high landscape value&quot;. Previous attempts to develop the area have met with little success. In 1996, a plan for &quot;change of use&quot; of Brandy Island, so-called because it was once home to a distillery, was refused. An appeal the following year was turned down by the secretary of state on the grounds that it would be harmful to the open countryside and a designated area of &quot;special landscape value&quot;. But a five-year plan to develop the Thames between 2006 and 2011, endorsed by the local councils, recognised that the island could be a potential home for a boat hire business. Cotswold Boat Hire, which bought the site at auction from Thames Water for around 400,000, currently operates from a small boatyard that it rents next to a pub about a mile away. The company said that it would have to give up its present site in the near future, and argues that unless it moves to a new venue boat enthusiasts will be denied the chance to enjoy a beautiful stretch of the Thames from the river. &quot;There are no other boat companies at this end of the Thames,&quot; said Shirley Wheeler who, along with her husband, Greg, has run the company for 21 years. &quot;It&apos;s nice to see boats going down the river. But you can&apos;t have boats if they don&apos;t set off from somewhere. We are part of the community and we want to be here for the long term.&quot; Wheeler said that they offered to sell the site to the National Trust for &quot;significantly&quot; more than they paid for it but the proposal was rejected. There appears to be little common ground between both camps and feelings are running high. The National Trust, which has looked after the village of Buscot since 1956, allowing it to preserve its character, is implacably opposed to the proposals and has launched a public relations offensive against the move, urging people to sign an online petition. &quot;The area around Brandy Island is a special place that is loved by thousands of people who go there for its unique, tranquil setting,&quot; said Richard Henderson, the National Trust&apos;s general manager for Oxfordshire. &quot;We support new development where it&apos;s appropriate for the local area, but in this case the proposals threaten what make this place special, and we are reflecting the views of many local stakeholders in strongly opposing the scheme.&quot; But Wheeler questioned whether the Trust&apos;s dominant position in the village was influencing local opinion unduly. &quot;In the parish, every single tenant is a member of the National Trust,&quot; she said. The local MP, the culture minister Ed Vaizey, has attempted to see if a compromise could be reached, holding a round-table meeting with all the interested parties. However, on Wednesday local residents voted overwhelmingly against the proposal, expressing fears that it would lead to large volumes of traffic going through the village and increase noise. Wheeler attacked the way that the issue has escalated into a full-blown dispute. Claims that her company would develop a campsite on the land, and a dry dock for storage were untrue, she said. They had cut down trees at the request of the Environment Agency and were planning to develop new habitats on the island for bats. &quot;Even last week, our busiest time, we only had six cars drive up,&quot; Wheeler said. She said that the move to the island would allow them to buy new boats and develop a business that would benefit the river. &quot;All of this opposition has come as a shock,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;One of the neighbours said to me, &apos;It&apos;s not you personally, we just don&apos;t want anything happening here&apos;.&quot;",

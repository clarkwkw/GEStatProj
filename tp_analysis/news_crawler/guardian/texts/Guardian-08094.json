    "text": "I was a principal lecturer at London Metropolitan University until 2009. It is a scandal that those suffering the consequences of the mismanagement that has led to the revocation of its licence to educate non-EU students will again be the students and staff rather than the culpable (Ban on non-EU students leaves 3,000 at risk of deportation, 30 August). The university management under vice-chancellor Malcolm Gillies seems to have wilfully ignored warnings of things going wrong. In 2010 I wrote to Professor Gillies expressing my concerns about what I saw as widespread failure of institutional processes. A new senior management team was essential if systems and procedures were to improve, but in fact little changed and things only got worse. The government needs to focus on finding a better way of running and regulating our universities, not punishing international students for the sins of administrators and regulators.Dr James Chiriyankandath Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London  Anyone concerned about the UK&apos;s reputation overseas and London&apos;s global status as the most popular destination city for foreign students will be dismayed at the damaging and disproportionate way in which the UK Border Agency has handled its dispute with London Met over its sponsorship of students from outside the EU. Of course the agency is right to expect a high level of administrative competence from trusted sponsors, so the public retains confidence in the system. It would be justified in requiring any university found wanting to improve its procedures. But pulling the rug from beneath all the university&apos;s existing non-EU students has caused unnecessary distress to people who are here legitimately and who have invested a great deal of money in their education and, thus, in the UK. Moreover, it has undermined an institution that plays a vital role in London&apos;s, and the UK&apos;s, educational infrastructure. For example, London Met educates more students from ethnic minorities than all of the Oxbridge colleges put together and attracts thousands of bona fide overseas students, whose fees effectively subsidise indigenous students&apos; education. The harm done to Britain&apos;s reputation in their countries of origin will inevitably affect future applications to all British universities. Foreign students contributed about 8bn to the UK economy in 2009. The government says it wants to encourage them, but its actions  from heavy-handed behaviour by UKBA to their illogical inclusion in the statistics on permanent migration  suggest the opposite.John DickieDirector of strategy and policy, LondonFirst  With the threat to compromise the Ecuadorean embassy&apos;s status and the continued difficulty with tourist visa processes for many prospective visitors, is there some kind of ministerial competition to see who can cause most damage to the UK&apos;s image abroad? We should welcome bona fide visitors and students, be grateful for their interest and not treat them like criminals.Tim FairhurstLondon  I was a lecturer at one of the precursor colleges of LMU and elsewhere in higher education, so know the potential difficulties of telling second- and third-year students to transfer to another institution. While it may be appropriate to penalise LMU by withdrawing its licence to admit new first-year students, it is entirely wrong to penalise students who have got to the later stages of their courses. If the courses are still running with UK and EU students, which I assume they will be, then why not allow the non-EU students to enrol and finish their qualifications? The benefits to the students and to the reputation of UK higher education will be immense.Dr Roger LoweryBromyard, Herefordshire  I am a former Metropolitan police border control officer and, while working on the controls over the years, have witnessed some amazing decisions in relation to the admission of bogus students. There should be two major barriers to bogus students  first, the visa and, second, UK border control when the student arrives. The issuing of UK visas has been subject to cost-cutting to the extent that virtually no visa applicants are interviewed. Everything is paper/email-based (a recent decision does allow prospective Pakistani students to be interviewed, owing to the complete shambles that exists in relation to UK visas in that country). Despite the rhetoric, a bogus student who re-enters the UK after, say, a holiday and who is discovered as bogus by the UKBF officer (for example, if he or she is barely literate) is still allowed into the UK to appeal, and is told to report back for interview and further enquiries. Many chief immigration officers have so little faith in the system that they instruct that the &quot;student&quot; be landed even though they are clearly bogus. Virtually no bogus students who are discovered in this way are ever removed. Yet genuine foreign students are often treated appallingly, especially in their dealings with the Home Office. Genuine students already here should be allowed to complete their courses without undergoing the stress that this situation creates. Any task force should focus on those foreign students due to arrive in the UK over the next few days with the intention of studying at London Met. Chris HobbsLondon  I teach ESL students in Ethiopia and Romania for the Open University, and used to teach very diverse students at LMU. In all these cases, I have had few serious problems of comprehension. Teaching such students is a skill, which it seems your cowardly anonymous LMU lecturer (Comment, 31 August) has not acquired. She or he says s/he hopes that academic standards will improve. Even if that were to be necessary (and I dispute that), the tragedy of the present situation is that there is likely soon to be no university left to set any standards at all.Dr Michael DempseyLondon  The Guardian University Awards (Ad, 30 August) has the category &quot;Commitment to widening participation&quot;.

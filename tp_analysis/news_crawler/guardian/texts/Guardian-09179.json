In schools, [some students] think blindness is catching.&quot; Powerful Information&apos;s project aims to empower professionals and civil society leaders to use computers and the internet independently. At the heart of their efforts is BrailleKey, a keyboard with more advanced braille functions than its predecessor, the Perkins Brailler. The organisation aims to install braille-friendly computers in places such as internet cafes to promote more inclusive education and get greater numbers of visually impaired children integrated into mainstream schools. A dozen other projects  including an initiative to advance the treatment of cataracts in east Africa, a national TV series for visually impaired people in India, and a scheme that promotes the integration of children with albinism in Malawi and Zambia  were also selected to share in the Sightsavers&apos; Innovation Fund, which was launched earlier this year. Winning ideas were announced at the end of September. The fund encourages NGOs, academic institutions, disabled people&apos;s organisations and the private sector to put forward ideas to help overcome the challenges faced by the eye-health and social-inclusion sectors in developing countries. All the organisations selected will receive up to 75,000 to implement their proposal over a period of 18 months; in 2012, more than 933,000 has been granted to pilot projects across Africa and Asia. The initiative is part of a three-year partnership between Sightsavers and the UK&apos;s Department for International Development. About 285 million people are visually impaired worldwide, with 90% living in developing countries. Despite international pledges of support for the Vision 2020 campaign established in 2000 by the World Health Organisation (WHO)  which aims to eliminate all major causes of avoidable blindness by 2020  vision problems in poor countries still receive only a tiny portion of the attention they deserve. In India, for example, there has been only a 10% reduction in visual impairment  4% short of the target  over the past six years, according to the WHO. The WHO estimates that up to 80% of visual impairment is preventable, with some diseases that transmit blindness, such as trachoma  an illness that causes eyelashes to turn inwards  becoming widespread due to poor sanitation and overcrowding. Many cases of blindness are reversible: cataracts, which are responsible for 48% of blindness worldwide, are easily corrected through a relatively cheap and simple procedure in which an intraocular lens is inserted into the eye. Ensuring that people with visual impairment problems receive the right treatment can bring huge economic and social benefits for their communities. Although sight problems are not specified as a priority in the eight millennium development goals, they play a role in meeting most of the MDGs. People living with visual impairment, for example, often remain trapped in poverty because they are excluded from basic health and education.",

    "text": "  Stork-billed kingfisher, Pelargopsis capensis (synonym, Halcyon capensis; protonym, Alcedo capensis), Linnaeus, 1766, also known as the brown-headed stork-billed kingfisher, photographed in the Republic of Singapore, a Southeast Asian city-state off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula.  Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 25 December 2010 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D7000, 400 mm, iso:640, f/8.0, 1/320 sec. +2/3 EV    Question: This southeast Asian mystery bird&apos;s common family name is misleading. How is it misleading? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is a stork-billed kingfisher, Pelargopsis capensis, one of three very large Asian tree kingfishers that were recently removed from the genus Halcyon into Pelargopsis (family: Halcyonidae). This is the largest kingfisher species in Singapore.  Although a kingfisher, this species is not a fish specialist. Instead, it primarily hunts small mammals (mostly rodents) and birds.  Like most other kingfishers, the stork-billed kingfisher is residential and territorial, lives near water, is a sit-and-wait predator and excavates its nest cavity in a river bank (although a rotting tree or termite mound may instead be used). These birds are easily overlooked.  Stork-billed kingfishers have green upperparts, blue wings and tail, and a brown head and nape. It has rufous underparts with small and distinctively bright red legs and feet, orangish-red irides and a large and distinctive coral-red bill with a black tip. Genders look alike, although the female&apos;s bill may be noticeably heavier than her mate&apos;s.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

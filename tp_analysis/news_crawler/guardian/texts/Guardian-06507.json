    "text": "It&apos;s nearly a decade since Project Zero2&apos;s original release (with the &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot; addendum), arriving during a voguish period for ghostly Japanese horror  The Ring, The Grudge, Silent Hill etc. Set apart from the pack, this tidied-up Wii remake  Nintendo still ignoring pleas to call them &quot;Wiimakes&quot;  is easier to appreciate: a mournful corridor-stalker that forces players to engage with its spectral terrors. The premise, made more unsettling by lost-in-translation logic and creepily stilted English voiceovers, sees twin sisters Mayu and Mio exploring a village emptied by an unseen tragedy. What stops this from being another bump-filled haunted house is the camera obscura, which enables Mio to exorcise angry spirits by literally capturing them on film. It&apos;s a brilliant touch. In a genre normally built on escaping danger, Project Zero makes thrilling, wide-eyed confrontation your only hope.",

    "text": "Revolutionary guerrilla, bank robber, hijacker and notorious kidnapper of ambassadors Alfredo Sirkis would not fit most people&apos;s profile of an environmental activist. But the former freedom fighter has long since put down his gun and is now battling in the conference halls against a very modern threat: complacency about climate change. The Brazilian parliamentarian and founder member of the country&apos;s Green party is organising a &quot;war games-type simulation process&quot; that will coincide with next week&apos;s Rio+20 conference and draw up alternative scenarios to reducing greenhouse emissions. With the official United Nations climate talks bogged down by disputes between rich and poor nations and Rio+20 mired in procedural wrangling, Sirkis says it is important to push back the boundaries of possibility. &quot;We want to see how far we can go in modelling alternative pathways to a climate deal,&quot; said Sirkis. &quot;It will complement the UN process. We&apos;re trying to involve politicians and elder statesmen  people who are part of the establishment  not militants, but people who are willing to go further.&quot; The scenario-mapping exercise  which will be launched as the Rio Climate Challenge  will initially take place over five days but is seen as a long-term thinktank that will provide fresh ideas and options that can be fed into the formal UN process. The mix of radicalism and pragmatism are characteristic of Sirkis&apos;s colourful career. After student demonstrations in 1968 against the military dictatorship that then ruled Brazil, he joined the Popular Revolutionary Vanguard, a guerrilla group that attacked army installations, secured funds through bank heists and secured the release of imprisoned comrades with a series of audacious kidnappings  including ambassadors of West Germany and Switzerland, and the Japanese consul. He went on to become a journalist, novelist and environmentalist, and he is currently the head of the Rio+20 Group in parliament. In 1986 he was among the founders of Brazil&apos;s Green party, which he led for most of the following decade. The party has notched up some impressive election results, notably in the last presidential campaign in 2010 when the Green candidate Marina Silva secured more than 30% of the votes in Rio  Sirkis&apos;s power base. His city is now attracting global attention as the host of the UN Earth summit, which Sirkis has helped to prepare with a set of four key recommendations to create a green economy: reform of GDP indices, removal of subsidies for fossil fuels, investment in renewables and recognition of the economic value of services provided by ecosystems. He is frustrated that this terse but ambitious agenda has been steadily widened and diluted, yet still fails to take adequate account of what he sees as the biggest threat of all. &quot;The big absence in the Rio process is climate. Without that, there&apos;s no way to discuss the green economy and international governance,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s why we want to address the issue in an alternative way.&quot;",

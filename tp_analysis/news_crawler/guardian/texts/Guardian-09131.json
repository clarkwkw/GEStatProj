    "text": "Over the next 50 months, we need to grow a capital markets framework that enables finance to be deployed at speed and scale behind the low-carbon transition. The investor demand is there: institutions with assets in excess $20 trillion (12tn) called for global policy action at last year&apos;s Durban climate conference, up from $13tn at the 2009 Copenhagen summit. And in spite of the dark clouds of economic depression, a number of indicators are moving in the right direction. The costs of key clean technologies, such as LED lighting and solar power, continue to fall, while high and volatile commodity prices provide a powerful impetus for resource efficiency. But capital remains scarce and concerns are growing that new financial regulations such as Basel III and Solvency II could have the unintended consequence of discouraging long-term finance for environmental infrastructure. Furthermore, the excitement generated by green stimulus plans in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis has given way to a mood of green austerity. It&apos;s no secret what needs to happen. Capital will flow if there is investment-grade policy in place: clear and enforceable short-, medium- and long-term targets with effective incentives (and removal of disincentives such as fossil fuel subsidies). Smart public finance is also critical, marrying heightened ambition with cost-effectiveness, recognising that public funds are scarce and need to work harder to mobilise individual savers, institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds. This means getting much better at spreading best practice across borders. In the first half of 2012 alone, Germany&apos;s public finance arm, KfW, allocated 12.1bn to climate and the environment, offering powerful lessons to the UK&apos;s emerging green investment bank. Growing investor interest in low-carbon infrastructure could also be met at the margin by fiscal support to buy-down construction risks for investors through loan guarantees or the credit enhancement of project bonds. And in terms of focal areas, the top priority must be energy efficiency where global progress has lagged that of renewables on the supply side. Here, the UK could become a world leader in energy efficiency financing if it gets the green deal right, constructing a smooth conveyor belt between residential renovation and the bond portfolios of ISAs and pension funds. Finally, extra action to promote low-carbon investment will also need to be matched by efforts to recognise the risks of high carbon assets in investment portfolios. Environmental costs need to be fully integrated into capital expenditure plans for new coal, oil and gas reserves if the threat of stranded assets is to be avoided as the low-carbon economy takes shape.

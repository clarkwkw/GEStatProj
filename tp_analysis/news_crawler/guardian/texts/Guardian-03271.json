    "text": "      This week&apos;s Caturday video smile comes from an eagle-eyed friend of mine, Friends Of Darwin. In this video, we watch an office worker in Mumbai throw a paper aeroplane out of his 18th story office window. The video follows this aeroplane&apos;s progress as it flutters over the nearby hillside, only to be intercepted by a pair of black kites, Milvus migrans. One of the birds captures it, floats high in the sky with it, then grows wise to the true nature of the aeroplane and drops onto the distant hillside.    This video is peculiarly evocative, reminding me of the scene in the film, American Beauty, where a plastic bag is being blown along on the breeze. I also enjoyed this video because the videographer has a remarkably steady hand and allows us to hear the sounds of this part of Mumbai without adding commentary.             [video link].  NOTE: the silly cat/pet/animal videos that are shared here on Saturday (Caturday) mornings are intended to amuse. This feature is designed to help hard-working and stressed-out people shed their professional faade so they can be better friends, companions, parents, family members and drinking pals to those in their personal lives. Any relationship between these videos and science or any scientific principle is sweet when I manage to present a solid connection to you, but is random, usually coincidental and mostly unintended.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  twitter: @GrrlScientist facebook: grrlscientist evil google+: grrlscientist email: grrlscientist@gmail.com",

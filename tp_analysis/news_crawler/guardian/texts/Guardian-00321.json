    "text": "A decade ago Edmund Harriss inherited 10,000. But rather than spend the money on a car, a fancy watch or an expensive holiday, he bought a laser cutter.  I wanted to make tiles and intricate shapes, says Harriss, a British mathematician who teaches University of Arkansas. A laser cutter is a powerful way to make ideas reality. Using his expensive new machine, Harriss developed a system of flat shapes that connect together to make curved objects like spheres. He calls the system Curvahedra and has used it for the last few years to encourage children and adults to play with maths. (Full disclosure: I have written about Harrisss work before on this blog, and as a result we collaborated on a book of mathematical colouring.) Curvahedra is based on a very simple idea: how to take something two-dimensional and make it three dimensional. The system has only four basic shapes, each a swirly star with either three, four, five or six branches:     Curvahedra connectors    The shapes are laser cut from card and designed so that when you connect them together, which you do by slotting them together by hand, the object begins to curve. Curvahedra are fun to put together, and make for pretty objects to have on your desk. But what I like most about them is that they are an easy way to explore simple geometric solids, or polyhedra. A polyhedron consists of a number of flat faces that join along edges and at vertices (points). Each Curvahedra piece corresponds to a vertex, and the number of branches in that piece corresponds to the number of edges coming from that vertex. For example, here is the icosahedron, which is a shape made from 20 identical equilateral triangles.     Icosahedron    The icosahedron has 12 vertices, which each link 5 edges. So you can make it with 12 Curvahedra 5-branch pieces.     Icosahedron    Here is the dodecahedron, which is made from 12 identical pentagons.     Dodecahedron    It has 20 vertices, each joining three edges. So you can make it with 20 Curvahedra 3-branch pieces.     Dodecahedron    You can also make more exotic shapes like the snub cube:     Snub cube       Snub cube    Even though the structure of the underlying polyhedra are not spherical, the forces in the paper turn them into balls. You can create lots of non-spherical objects too: such as the mucube, or multiple cube, which is a stack of cubes with sides removed that is a single surface:     Mucube       Mucube    Harriss says that when he shows Curvahedra to people, they often work out on their own how it fits together. It is beautiful to see people beginning their discoveries in their own right. Many of the questions people start to ask, you can answer with mathematics. So the maths is motivated by questions they have come up with. After years of patiently cutting Curvahedra pieces on his laser cutter, and handing them out to family, friends and students, Harriss has just launched a Kickstarter campaign to make them available to the general public.  If you would like to get your hands on his maths balls, I mean if you would like to explore three dimensional geometry in a really fun way, then I fully recommend supporting the campaign.

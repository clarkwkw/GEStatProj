    "text": "Mystery Bird photographed somewhere in Victoria, a state in the southeastern part of Australia. [I will identify this bird in 48 hours]  Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 27 December 2011 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D7000     Question: This distinctive Australian bird has a particular behaviour that has earned it special affection in many parts of its range. What behaviour is that and what is its nickname? Can you identify this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Is this bird an adult or juvenile? Is it a male or female? For extra smug points, can you identify the bird in the background? The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird&apos;s identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints that may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints, such as puns and anagrams, may read like &quot;inside jokes&quot; and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

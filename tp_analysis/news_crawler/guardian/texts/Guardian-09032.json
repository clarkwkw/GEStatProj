    "text": "The remark by the RIM chief executive that &quot;we have a clear shot at being the number three platform on the market&quot; in smartphones is under threat in Europe. New research from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech has found that low-cost phones from Nokia are driving up market share of Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone, which is starting to challenge the BlackBerry for third place in Europe. In Italy, Windows Phone achieved a 10.4% share in the 12 weeks to 2 September 2012, the first time the platform has hit double digits for market share in a single country. RIM&apos;s BlackBerry, by contrast, saw its share fall from 4.8% in the same period a year ago to just 3.5% this time. Market share reflects a snapshot of sales, not the proportion or number of devices in use, known as the &quot;installed base&quot;. The Kantar figures also reflect consumer, and not corporate sales.  Across the &quot;big five&quot; EU countries  the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and France  Windows Phone now shows a 5% share, up one point from a year ago, while RIM&apos;s has almost halved from 12.2% to 6.4%. But the challenge for both the smaller platforms is thrown into stark relief by data showing that in the US, Android and iOS combined had 93% of all smartphone sales in the period, which precedes the launch of the iPhone 5. In the &quot;big five&quot; European countries, Android plus iOS had an 82.5% share, of which the majority was Android, with 68.5%, while iOS had a 14% share.  Samsung is crushing the rest of the smartphone market, with a market share of 48% across the &quot;big five&quot; European countries, says Kantar. Sony is also doing well in the region, with its new Experia phones outselling both the Nokia and BlackBerry models in Spain, German and France, Kantar said. Other data shows Android strengthening its market share in every territory except, unusually, the US, where its share fell from 62.9% a year ago to 59.6% now; only the iPhone showed market share growth there, up from 24.6% to 33.6%. Elsewhere, Android dominates. In the UK, Android had 62.5% of sales, up from 49.9% a year ago; in Germany, 78.6% (from 51.4%); in France 61.5% (47.8%); in Italy 58.7% (37.2%); in Spain 84% (55.2%); in Australia 65.8% (48.8%). Android is also taking over in emerging markets where Nokia&apos;s now-deprecate Symbian and RIM&apos;s BlackBerry had dominated.  In Brazil it had 47.1% of sales, compared to 19.6% a year ago  and zoomed past Symbian, which last year had 64.5% of sales for the 12-week period. That has dropped to 26.7%, although Windows Phone has jumped to 12.2%, suggesting that Nokia has a total market there of 38.9%  almost certainly bigger than any single rival. RIM increased its market share from 2.5% to 4.1%, in line with its general growth in emerging markets in the past quarter. In Mexico, Android leads with a 37.3% share (19.4% last year), overtaking the former leader RIM&apos;s 34.4% share at the same time last year. Though Symbian is dropping there, it still has a 20.2% share  and together with the 2.7% share suggests that Nokia has a 22.9% share in the country, while RIM has a 29.7% share. A total of 57.6% of British mobile phone users have smartphones, which made up 80.4% of all sales here in the 12-week period, Kantar said.",

    "text": "Nintendo&apos;s Professor Layton series tends to divide the critics. To some, it is little more than a puzzle compendium, padded out with filler narrative. To others, it combines an elaborate fictional world with neatly implemented brain-benders. The reality is a little of both, and now the series has come to the 3DS. Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask challenges the player to accompany its eccentric academic and his assistants in solving the mystery of a masked super-villain terrorising the inhabitants of the fictional town of Monte d&apos;Or. In pursuit of the truth, Layton must solve some 150 puzzles presented to him by the characters he meets. While a hugely varied selection of conundrums present themselves, each is of the well-known variety that sees foxes and geese sharing raft trips, and matchsticks being moved to form squares. Despite this familiar form of puzzling, there are plenty of unique ideas on offer for long-standing Layton fans, and the game&apos;s world is a rich and elaborate one, well realised in 3D, brought to life with good writing and supported by an ornate audio backdrop. Like its forerunners, Miracle Mask remains an elaborate spin on a straight-up puzzle collection, but one so elegant and engrossing, it is hard not to fall for.",

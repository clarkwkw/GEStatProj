    "text": "Conservative-controlled Kent county council has voted to allow the creation of two satellite grammar schools linked to existing schools in the county, in the first extension of selective secondary education for decades. The decision is in response to a petition signed by more than 2,000 parents calling for grammar school places to be created in Sevenoaks. Currently, more than 1,000 children commute from the area to grammar schools in neighbouring towns. Under legislation introduced by Labour, no new grammar schools may open. But a new admissions code brought in by the coalition gives greater freedom to existing, popular schools, including grammars, to expand. Though the council has agreed to the creation of the Sevenoaks satellite schools, no existing host grammar has yet been identified for expansion. The proposed scheme would involve two new annexes  one for girls and one for boys  catering for about 120 children each year who have passed the 11-plus exam. The two annexes would be linked to separate, single-sex host schools but could coexist on the same site. Expansion of selective education on a satellite site has not happened since the 1960s, although last year Torquay boys&apos; grammar school looked at the possibility of expanding to a site seven miles away. A satellite school would face difficulties with admissions and logistics. It would need to have the same admissions arrangements  and therefore the same catchment area  as its host school in a neighbouring town. Teachers would be required to commute between sites. A letter to the council from the Sevenoaks Grammar School Campaign said children from the town faced a daily round trip of 25 miles to reach grammar schools in Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells. It said: &quot;This has a negative effect on their learning, on their opportunities for hobbies and sport, on their opportunities to develop friendships, and on the time they spend with their families.&quot; Sevenoaks grammar school campaigner Sarah Shilling said: &quot;Sevenoaks is the only major town within the existing Kent grammar school system that is without a grammar school. &quot;Sevenoaks children who pass the 11-plus test are increasingly often denied places at Kent grammar schools because they live outside the shrinking catchment areas. &quot;Some Sevenoaks children who scored as high as 99% of the full mark on this year&apos;s 11-plus test were not offered a grammar-school place. Extra grammar school places are desperately needed in Sevenoaks to cater for our children.&quot; A Department for Education spokesman said: &quot;Legislation prohibits the establishment of new grammar schools and ministers have been clear that that will not change. Any school can already expand by opening a satellite site. This has been the case since 1944. &quot;It is for Kent county council, as the decision-maker for maintained schools in Kent, to decide how it fulfils its legal duty to provide sufficient school places in Kent.&quot;",

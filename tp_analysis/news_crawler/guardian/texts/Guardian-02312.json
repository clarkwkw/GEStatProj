    "text": "A friend of mine, a medical man, who lives in Oxford Road, Manchester, found a leech clinging with suctorial energy to the flag beneath his backdoor scraper. He wants to know how it got there, for the nearest permanent water is about a quarter of a mile away. Which leech was it? &quot;It was a dirty olive-green colour,&quot; but my friend does not say if it had any yellowish stripes, rather noticeable marks on the imported medicinal leech. He suggests that it might have been an escape, though medicinal are not used so frequently as they were at one time. If it was this species I favour the escape theory. Leeches can live out of water so long as their skins are moist, and on several nights recently an ambulatory leech would have little excuse for getting dry.  If it was a common horse leech there are three possible methods of overland travel - an overland journey on a wet night, an involuntary voyage through the water-supply pipes, or an ascent from the drains. The second suggestion is not likely. Before filtration was as perfect as it is I have met with living small crustaceans and even a dead but diminutive stickleback in the bath, but a leech is much more unlikely. The drain theory, which my friend mentions, has other difficulties; how would it get into the sewer? A journey against the stream from a distant sewage farm is hardly conceivable, and if it had travelled by surface drainage from some open pond it would still have had a complicated passage into the household sewers. Nocturnal and probably aimless wandering seems the most likely solution.",

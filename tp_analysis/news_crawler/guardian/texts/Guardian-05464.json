    "text": "I read with particular interest the open letter by Rothamsted Research to a group of activists intending to destroy Rothamsted&apos;s GM field trial to control aphids. If the trial is destroyed it will be almost exactly four years since one of our publicly funded trials at the University of Leeds was also destroyed. That trial was to test plants made resistant to nematodes, microscopic worm-like pests that cause an estimated $118bn annual losses to world crops. Like the Rothamsted trial it had no company involvement. One aim was to establish a future approach for UK agriculture. We also wished to evaluate the general value of the technology before donating it for development by public scientists in sub-Saharan Africa, where over 50% of the banana yields are lost to nematodes. The uprooting of the plants could have destroyed many years of publicly funded research. Luckily, that outcome was avoided by a trial in the following year  but only because we spent money on security fences and a 24-hour guard. Our progress has now enabled scientists in Africa to develop nematode-resistant bananas for field evaluation, but the issues that arose at that time are still unresolved. The debate in the UK about the benefits and concerns surrounding future use by farmers of GM crops in the UK and globally, needs to progress. The concerns raised by protesters about environmental and food safety issues would truly only apply once widespread cropping by farmers occurred. They do not apply to these small-scale field trials. The distinction between such trials and commercial cropping is recognised by legislation in the European Union and elsewhere. The small-scale trials are needed to test whether promising approaches developed in laboratories and glasshouses will also be effective under field conditions. Our trial of 400 plants grown in isolation from all other similar crops was on a very different scale from any future UK commercial cropping, that would involve many millions of plants like wheat. Such adoption requires prior scrutiny for remote risks. All UK GM small-scale field trials are inspected by the national inspectorate to ensure there is no breach of environmental safety. All plants in our trials were collected and destroyed by a specialist company to ensure our guarantee that no plants would enter any food chain. Afterwards, the land was inspected at monthly intervals until it was certain that there were no plants left in the ground. Our results also answered one of the concerns of activists, showing no harmful effect on the beneficial soil nematodes that do not damage crops. They are important to soil health and killed by pesticides. A debate is needed about the uptake by farmers of GM technology, such as ours for nematode resistance or that of Rothamsted for aphid control. There are still several years available for this discussion, as European legislations require comprehensive data on food and environmental safety before the big step from small-scale field trials to use by farmers is allowed. It is too early for such detailed work to be taken by Rothamsted scientists and others, until the approach is known to work well in the field. If it is effective, a thorough programme of work would be demanded as prematurely sought by activists. The research leader of the aphid work is John Pickett. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and one of the UK&apos;s most senior scientists. The pick and mix approach of activists to his science is very arbitrary. Activists condemn his judgment over the need for his current research while praising his development of a pesticide-free approach to insect control for small farmers in Africa. But UK scientists have both national and international responsibilities. The ongoing debate is not new. Galileo Galilei stated &quot;all truths are easy to understand once they are discovered, the point is to discover them&quot;. Anyone can read our field trial results in an open access journal, and raise arguments against the work. This is not the outcome that activists want. They prefer to destroy new knowledge such as that on aphid control, which UK society needs to make informed decisions on the future use of GM crops.

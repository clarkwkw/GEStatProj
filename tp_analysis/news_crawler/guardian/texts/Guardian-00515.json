    "text": "The Guardian iPad edition app has passed the 500,000 downloads mark, three months after launching on Apple&apos;s App Store. And 23,000 of those downloads came on Christmas Day, according to parent company Guardian News &amp; Media. The news comes as the app gets a new section on Saturdays: the Guardian&apos;s Weekend magazine. Articles and recipes from the weekly magazine will be housed within a dedicated section of the Saturday iPad edition of the newspaper. &quot;Weekend magazine&apos;s stunning photography perfectly suits the form and the clean, modern design of our app on iPad,&quot; says Weekend editor Merope Mills.  &quot;From tomorrow, readers will be able to enjoy a leisurely read of our award-winning longform journalism, flick through the galleries of &apos;Your Pictures&apos; or watch our brilliant fashion and beauty correspondents Jess Cartner-Morley and Sali Hughes, as they guide readers through the latest lifestyle trends.&quot; The app has been free since its launch on 13 October 2011, thanks to a sponsorship deal with broadcaster Channel 4. That three-month trial period runs out on 13 January, at which point those first 500,000 readers will be asked to sign up for a 9.99 monthly subscription using Apple&apos;s in-app purchases system. Existing six- and seven-day print subscribers will continue to get access to the iPad app for no additional charge, while new downloaders will get a week&apos;s free trial before being asked to subscribe.",

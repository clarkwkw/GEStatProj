    "text": "Vincent&apos;s having a tough time of it. A man content to while away his early 30s in a jazz bar, the Stray Sheep, he&apos;s in a long-term relationship with Katherine, who&apos;s starting to grumble about marriage and kids. Then he starts having nightmares; other men are there, too, all of them in ovine form. Young guys start dying in their sleep, and he cheats on Katherine with Catherine, a nubile blonde who appears at the bar one night. Then Katherine reveals she&apos;s pregnant. With its focus on dreams, sheep and relationships, Catherine&apos;s story could have been lifted straight from the pages of a Haruki Murakami novel. It&apos;s compelling stuff, but the game itself is too hard for its own good. Vincent&apos;s nightmares play out as 3D sliding block puzzles, but what at first seem like tests of logic soon become ones of memory, as sparse checkpoints require you to memorise several minutes&apos; worth of pushing, pulling and climbing at a time. Playing it on easy is a necessity; there are multiple endings, and you can always bump up the difficulty in subsequent play-throughs if you&apos;re the masochistic sort, but while Catherine is a lot of things  smart, sexy and genuinely intriguing  it&apos;s not a very good video game.",

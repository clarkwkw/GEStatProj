    "text": "This striking image shows the Caspian Sea, with shallow waters surrounding the Tyuleniy archipelago revealing dark green vegetation on the sea floor. Ocean scientist Norman Kuring of Nasas Goddard Space Flight Center found a puzzling feature in the image  lines crisscrossing the sea bottom. What caused those lines? Similar lines show up in the worlds oceans because of trawling. But the scientific literature and a January satellite image suggest that a majority of the marks in the images were gouged by ice. In January, blocks of ice stand at the leading end of many lines, most notably in the north-east corner of the image. By April, ice has melted and only the scour marks persist.       In late September , the clouds around South Georgia Island parted to reveal a large bright-white iceberg floating in the Atlantic Ocean just north-west of the island. After calving, icebergs can travel many hundreds of miles from their calving front, moving most rapidly during the austral summer when sea ice melts and open water becomes more prevalent. Icebergs are named based on the Antarctic quadrant in which they originated and the order in which they were discovered. This iceberg, A66, was the 66th iceberg named which originated from the Bellingshausen/Weddell Sea.      The Tnr region in north-eastern Niger is one of the hottest and driest regions in the Sahara desert, with average maximum temperatures above 40C between May and September and average annual precipitation 2025mm. It is also one of the sunniest regions on Earth, clocking up about 4,000 hours of sunshine a year. The regions geography largely consists of planes with sand dunes (ergs), seen as yellow areas in the upper image, that are oriented perpendicular to the persistent north-easterly wind (Harmattan) that blows sand and dust, visible here as faint feather-like structures.       A true-colour image of the Queensland coast and a portion of the Great Barrier Reef. On 13 September, Nasa and Australian scientists kicked off a two-month study of the reef. The Nasa mission, known as Coral Reef Airborne Laboratory (Coral) is a three-year mission that combines aerial surveys using state-of-the-art airborne imaging spectrometer technology with in-water validation activities to generate a uniform data set for a large sample of reefs across the Pacific Ocean, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Hawaiian Islands, the Mariana Islands and Palau.      In mid-September, wildfires continued to burn in Siberia amid an active fire season for the region  huge plumes of smoke can be seen here streaming toward the north-west. Areas in red show where Modis detected unusually warm temperatures associated with fire. Other data revealed that smoke from the fires was lofted high into the atmosphere, with the tops of the smoke plumes reaching an altitude of 9km (30,000ft).       Although it may appear as a watercolour painting, this image is a natural-colour capture of a plankton bloom in the Barents Sea. Plankton, the most abundant type of life found in the ocean, are microscopic marine plants that drift on or near the surface of the sea. They are sometimes referred to as the grass of the sea because they are the basic food on which all other marine life depends. Plankton are able to convert inorganic compounds such as water, nitrogen and carbon into complex organic materials. With their ability to digest these compounds, they are credited with removing as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as their counterparts on land. As a result, the oceans have a profound influence on climate.  Some algae species are toxic or harmful. If they surge out of control during optimal blooming conditions they can exhaust the water of oxygen and suffocate larger fish. This phenomenon has dramatically increased in recent decades, and is particularly dangerous to fish farms because the fish cannot flee affected areas. Early warning of harmful blooms from satellites can help to prevent fish deaths.      Plumes of dust pour across northern Libya and the Mediterranean Sea in early September. Dust storms are a common occurrence and the primary natural hazard in Libya. They are often driven by hot, dry south or southeasterly wind known as the ghibli. Strong winds and dust storms can occur any time of the year, but are more common in the spring and fall.      Highway 277 cuts through the southern Brazilian state of Paran, dividing the lush green forest of Iguaz national park from a patchwork of ploughed sugar cane farms.   Black out in Puerto Rico   Late on 21 September, a fire at a power plant substation in southern Puerto Rico triggered a cascade of problems across the islands ageing electrical grid. The event knocked out power to nearly 1.5 million customers. According to news reports, the collapse of the power system caused widespread losses of water and air conditioning, traffic jams, and business and school closures. From space, the effects appeared dramatic, as these nighttime images taken before and after the outage illustrate. The upper image was acquired at 2.50am local time on 21 September; the lower image at 2.31am local time the following day. Both images were captured by a day-night band, which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe signals such as gas flares, city lights, and reflected moonlight. Note that the brightness of the ocean surface varies between the images due to slightly different angles of moonlight on the water.      On 17 July 2016, one of the largest ice avalanches ever recorded tumbled down a Tibetan mountain, killing nine people. The cause of the collapse is still unclear. On 22 September, a second glacier, 1.9 miles (3km) farther south, collapsed, seen here. Geologists investigating the July collapse warned about the possibility of a second collapse, which did occur. The image covers an area of 7.8 by 10.2 milesand was acquired 4 October.       The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma) high in the mountains of Chile in the Atacama desert aims to capture longer wavelengths of light. Alma does this by combining the 66 antennas of the array to work together as one. Using Alma, scientists research topics in radio astronomy such as planet formation and galaxy formation in the early universe. This image shows a planetary system around a young star.   Nairobi population growth   As nations develop their economies, younger generations are drawn from rural areas into cities seeking work. Urban growth rates in recent years have been particularly pronounced in lower and middle-income countries. Africa depicts this global migration trend in high relief. Nairobi is a prime example, with its population pushing upward and its boundaries pushing outward. At the time of the last official government census in 2009, the population of Kenya numbered more than 38 million people, with 3.5 million housed in Nairobi  more than double the 1986 population. The images above, acquired in 1986 and 2016, show the expansion of Kenyas capital in the past three decades. While such migration often mirrors economic advancement, it also presents socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Rapid urban growth strains existing infrastructure. Conservationists also note that it discourages the preservation of natural habitat in favor of building more developments. In Nairobi, urbanisation has caused the city to encroach on former green spaces such as the nearby national parks and forests. Population density in Nairobi varies greatly, peaking in the citys slums, which house roughly 2.5 million people in about 200 settlements. Roughly 60% of Nairobis population occupies just 6% of the land. The citys largest slum, Kibera (the light-coloured patch north of Nairobi national park) is made up of small, tightly packed structures. Although both of the images above were taken at a similar time of the year, the more recent one depicts greener vegetation, the result of a rainy El Nio cycle.",

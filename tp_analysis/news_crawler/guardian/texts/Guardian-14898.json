    "text": "The &apos;glorious twelfth&apos; for academics is upon us, open season for a tidal wave of incoming student assignments. How do we contend with this influx? My strategies fall into two camps: coping strategies for the here and now, and actions to ease the pain next time round. Five tips for the short term 1) Mark little and often. With the best will in the world, I would defy anyone to mark more than four to five undergraduate dissertations of 8-10,000 words in a day. It takes me around an hour and a half to read and set down comments and arrive at a mark for each. Four will snaffle six hours for starters. There&apos;s also the question of fairness to the student: will you be able to concentrate and deal equitably with dissertation seven, as you did the day&apos;s first? 2) Commit to returning deadlines. Consider which assessments need to be returned soonest, for example to adhere to institutional agreements such as &apos;return of marked work within 20 working days&apos;. If it can wait, then so be it. It also helps to mark batches of the same assignment to avoid dipping across levels, topics and assignment types. 3) Mark the work, not the student. Though it&apos;s worth adding that when my university brought in blind marking  with only a student number on the assessment not a name  our parttime, mature distance-learners insisted on putting names to work because they were proud of what they&apos;d done. 4) Match up your words and numbers. If you write &quot;excellent, faultless, 73%&quot; be clear about why the student lost 27%. Always mark across the full 100 marks. If it&apos;s dire then don&apos;t let it by with more than 30%; if it really is (virtually) faultless, then why not a mark in the 90s? By and large, avoid (as the Beatles lyric) number nine  39%, 69% and so on  it&apos;s a hostage to litigation and dispute. 5) Be constructively critical. It&apos;s not our job to trip up students, but to reward and offer insight on how to improve next time. Personally, I favour text comments and overall pluses and minuses set down on a cover sheet. In this way, the student (and staff member) can make sense of, and justify, how they reached a particular mark. Finally, get a colleague to second mark fails and outstanding pieces and be sure to draw the external examiner&apos;s attention to them. Five ways to improve assessment next time 1) Spread out hand-in dates. Embrace, where appropriate, formative assessments that take place in the first seven weeks of a module. Also consider implenting either/or submission deadlines  most of the courses I teach offer a choice of November or January. 2) Embrace variety of assessment. My vocational undergraduate courses encompass essays, group tasks, reports, individual reflective pieces, portfolios, posters, live project analysis and more. When designing assignments, think about what learning outcomes you are assessing and why, and ask yourself: is this an appropriate vehicle for doing so? 3) Go electronic where possible. Using a secure virtual learning environment such as Moodle automatically logs submission dates and times and makes it easy to track changes and return marked work. External examiners have open access to assessment material and it also reduces paper consumption and the chances of a slipped disc for the postman. 4) Exams aren&apos;t one size fits all. Open book papers, time-constrained tasks, online quizzes and multiple choice  yours doesn&apos;t have to be a bog-standard closed examination. In in doubt about which format is appropriate, remember again that assessment exists to facilitate learning  and make it so. 5) Make your feedback legible. You are not a doctor delivering an illegible prescription. My script is so poor that I provide handwritten comments using block capitals. At 9,000 tuition fees, the least we lecturers can do is provide readable and meaningful commentary to our students.

    "text": "The physics community waits with bated breath for announcements pending from teams of particle physicists on either side of the Atlantic. These physicists, working at the LHC and the Tevatron  a similar, but less powerful accelerator that operated in the United States until September of 2011  are expected to show the latest results from their Higgs boson searches. Even if a discovery is announced, the questions don&apos;t stop there. In fact, even before the champagne stops flowing, the prevalent question amongst the boffins will turn from &quot;will you discover something?&quot; to &quot;what have you discovered?&quot;      A low mass bison at Fermilab    Experimental particle physicists are treasure hunters sifting through the vast sands that are their data. And while we employ rigorous statistical tests to determine if we&apos;ve struck treasure of just a piece of driftwood, we don&apos;t always have a way of telling what our treasure is once we&apos;ve hauled it out. In the case of the Higgs boson, the map we follow is the venerable theory of particle physics known as the Standard Model. It&apos;s not your traditional treasure map though, as it has knobs to twist  knobs that change where the &quot;X&quot; (the location of the Higgs boson) falls on the map. Each knob is of a quantity we have to go out and measure in the Universe. There are about 20 such knobs depending how you count them, but one moves the &quot;X&quot; more than any of the others: the mass of the W boson.  The W boson, along with its electrically neutral cousin, the Z boson, dictate the whims of one of the forces described in physics: the weak nuclear force (responsible for, among other things, certain types of radioactive decays). Since their discovery just under 30 years ago, physicists have been trying to nail down their physical properties to a T. They are rather heavy by quantum standards, weighing in at around the mass of an arsenic atom each, which made simply producing enough of them at 1980s vintage particle accelerators a challenge. Eventually, CERN built a collider known as the Large Electron Positron collider, or LEP, with the primary goal of refining measurements of the W and Z bosons. After a pair of very successful runs in the 1990s, the LEP experiments wrote the book on the Z boson, measuring its mass to an astonishing precision of 0.002%. The mass of the W, however, was a little trickier, and the final word there was &quot;only&quot; 0.04% (still  very impressive). This is where some of my colleagues and I working on the Tevatron in the USA thought we could shine. I say &apos;some&apos; because many simply looked at us as if we were insane. You see, for starters, the LEP collider collided particles that to the best of our knowledge are &quot;fundamental&quot; point particles. This means that if an accurate assessment of the energies of the particles being collided could be made, an accounting of everything produced in the collisions boils down to a task of adding everything up. Colliders like the Tevatron and LHC collide protons (and in the case of the Tevatron, their anti-matter cousins). This is a bit like hurling rubbish bins at each other and hoping a hedgehog emerges from one of them. Rubbish bins whose exact contents, thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, can never be known exactly, only guessed.  So, the deck is already stacked against us. As if having the accelerator be our enemy wasn&apos;t enough, we then have to contend with understanding the very complicated detectors that we&apos;ve built on top of that. Being able to measure the mass of the W boson to a precision greater than the LEP experiments could requires an other-worldly level of understanding of our own detector. While the Standard Model is complicated enough, with 18 knobs, our detector literally has hundreds of thousands. For 99% of the measurements done with it, those knobs are set to the &quot;good-enough&quot; setting.  Good-enough isn&apos;t good enough for us measuring the mass of the W boson. We have to set about making measurements within measurements. The charged particles that decay from W bosons (electrons and muons) and are detected have to have their energies measured to a part in ten thousand. The laws of quantum mechanics cause photons to trickle off of these electrons and muons, causing them to lose a fraction of their energy. Those photons can, in turn, interact with material in our detector and convert to other particles. Effects such as these and many others simply wouldn&apos;t matter at the 1% level or even the 0.1% level but become our bread and butter at the 0.01% level.  Ok, so after reading the last paragraph, I&apos;ll admit I can see why some of my colleagues think we&apos;re insane for wanting to do this. But I&apos;ll confess now, I enjoy doing this kind of careful, detailed work. To me this is what experimental science is about.  I digress. After nearly five years of careful measurement, and cross-check upon cross-check, we announced to the community that we were done. The community then turned and looked, for not only had we exceeded the precision of any of the LEP experiments or previous measurements at the Tevatron, we had achieved a precision greater than all previous measurements of the W boson mass ever made combined. After the dust settled, we had produced a measurement of 80.387 GeV with a total uncertainty of 0.019 GeV (the uncertainty of every other measurement made before combined? 0.023 GeV).  The treasure map knob was turned and overnight, the Higgs boson had much less room to hide. In fact, the precision of this measurement was such that if the number measured had inched a little higher or lower, it could have blown a big hole in the Standard Model. Instead, the window remains (narrowly) open. If the Higgs boson isn&apos;t found, or a &quot;Higgs boson&quot; is found outside that window, we physicists get to go back to the drawing board.      The plane in W boson mass and top quark mass. The diagonal grey areas show the allowed Higgs mass after the LHC data. They have to overlap with the ellipses or the Standard Model is inconsistent. The orange ellipse is the previous status, the smaller green one is after the CDF measurement. It could have plonked on the upper half of the orange one, instead of the lower, which would have been a problem for the Standard Model    Bo Jayatilaka is a researcher at Duke University working on the CDF experiment at the Tevatron The measurement by the D0 experiment was also released today and can be found here.",

    "text": "Mystery money Qatar, the richest country in the world on a per capita basis, is proving the most generous host. It has flown in and is paying around 600 students from developing country universities to work in the gigantic convention centre during the talks. It paid for 100 Arab climate activists to attend a demonstration and put them up in a five-star hotel, and it has been known quietly that money is not the problem at these talks. Now the Qataris have announced a press conference for Wednesday featuring the Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, the UN general secretary, Ban Ki-moon and UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres to discuss a &quot;high-level commitment from the government of Qatar&quot;. The gulf is agog. Could it be the $100bn that the developing world says it needs to adapt to climate change? A new green gas refinery? An eco city for the emirate&apos;s 1 million migrant workers? A team of premiership footballers? Watch this space. The brothers from Wichita US oil baron billionaires Charles and David Koch were accused at a meeting today of helping to paralyse the talks with their undue lobbying influence over the US government. According to a new report by global policy thinktank International Forum on Globalisation (IFG) , the libertarian climate-sceptic brothers who employ 30 lobbyists in Washington stand to gain more than any other industry from the Canadian tar sands. &quot;As the top spenders to stop climate policy the brothers from Wichita hold hostage any progress in Washington, and hence any meaningful global deal in Doha,&quot; said IFG director Victor Menotti. Bangladesh is in demand Which country has the highest international profile here? Judging by attendance at press conferences, it&apos;s certainly not Britain, which attracted a mere 40 journalists for Ed Davey&apos;s double act with Greg Barker on Tuesday. That was better than the EU, which could muster only about 20 but well behind the US with nearly 75. The most impressive so far has been Bangladesh which packed its slot with more than 90 delegates, journalists, TV crews and hangers on, putting a record seven ministers and officials on the stage. Prizes for poor showing go to the least developed country block which has cancelled most of its briefings so far and China, South Africa and Brazil who kept everyone waiting for 30 minutes and then walked off after one, albeit impenetrable, question. Key ministers snub Doha talks Some key climate ministers are evading planetary duty by snubbing the talks and staying at home. Indian environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan, who saved the Durban talks last year with her dramatic concessions in the last moments, says she has higher political commitments to attend including a key vote in parliament. Meanwhile, Australian climate minister Greg Combet says he needs to spend time with his other duties. He told the Sydney Morning Herald recently: &quot;I am going to spend a bit of time on my other portfolio area. We are able to do that because we have carbon price implemented, European Union emissions trading scheme linking agreed, and Kyoto protocol second commitment period all done&quot;. Greg, Greg, there&apos;s just a small matter of trying to cut Australian emissions by more than the miserable 0.5% you have so far pledged. Mohammad Al-Sabban is not missed None of the NGOs here are missing Mohammad Al-Sabban. He was the veteran Saudi negotiator who famously denied man-made climate change and demanded compensation for Saudi Arabia if nations reduced greenhouse gases. He also caused Oxfam and WWF enormous grief after someone  no names  flushed a Saudi nameplate down a loo at one meeting. &quot;Climate is changing for thousands of years, but for natural and not human-induced reasons,&quot; he told the BBC just before the 2009 Copenhagen talks. Did he go willingly or was he pushed? The elegant answer comes from a Saudi diplomat. &quot;It was for natural reasons&quot;. Salerno warms up for theatrics Claudia Salerno, the Venezuelan lead negotiator who dramatically stood on a chair and slashed her hand at the Copenhagen talks in 2009 to show the world how developing countries were bleeding, is on good form. There has been no shouting for attention on chairs yet, but she has been warming up for a piece of theatre by telling rich countries that they &quot;may as well make their own convention without the developing countries&quot;.",

    "text": "Next year, the Volkswagen Golf celebrates its 40th birthday. They&apos;ve sold 29m of them since 1974. Perhaps the car&apos;s enduring popularity is founded on the fact that it can bridge two stages of life. Unlike most of its competitors, with their slightly frumpy connotations  the Ford Focus, the Skoda Octavia  the Golf feels fun enough to buy when you&apos;re young, single and relatively carefree, but won&apos;t need replacing if you have kids. At least until you become fully aware of the untrammelled horror that is driving with small children, realise that said horror is mitigated slightly if the kids are as far away from you as is physically possible, abandon any pretensions that driving is about fun or passion or soul or any of those Top Gear adjectives, and buy a people carrier. I give up, just bring me the Citron Picasso. You might as well stick The Best Of Dire Straits in the CD player while you&apos;re about it: I&apos;m officially middle-aged. I reached that stage some years ago, and driving the Golf en famille didn&apos;t make me think I&apos;d made an error of judgment. There&apos;s nothing like realising the three-year-old having a meltdown in the rear seat is noticeably closer to the back of your head than usual to distract your attention from the smoothness of the ride and the increased fuel economy achieved by making the car lighter than its predecessor. Which is a shame, because there&apos;s a lot to like about the redesigned Golf. It&apos;s nearly 2,500 more than aFord Focus, and about 15 billion quid more than the new Skoda Octavia (a car that uses the same platform), but you can work out where your money goes. The interior feels more luxurious than its rivals, while the mid-range model I drove appears to be clairvoyant. Something called a PreCrash system &quot;detects the possibility of an accident&quot;  yes, yes, my wife made the joke about it going off as soon as I sat in the driver&apos;s seat, too  then tenses up the seatbelts and closes the windows to ensure the airbags provide the best protection. Even the entry-level model has something they refer to as atouchscreen infotainment centre with DAB radio, USB inputs and Bluetooth telephone preparation, which sounds more complicated than it is. Indeed, I can tell you from bitter experience that even a child could use it: sitting in the front passenger seat, my eldest daughter happily whiled away one journey switching stations every 10 seconds, turning the volume up and down, etc. It was at this point Idecided the Golf definitely wasn&apos;t for me. Anyone unencumbered by the nonpareil joy of parenthood could do substantially worse.

    "text": "The original Metro 2033 was a sleeper hit, earning praise for its sharp blend of tense, post-apocalyptic terror and superb action long after its release. No surprise though, as the Metro games are far deeper than even hardened players might expect from a first-person shooter. Based on the novels of Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, Metro: Last Light follows Artyom, a young man trying to survive in the ruins of Moscow&apos;s subway system, a network serving as humanity&apos;s refuge after a nuclear war. The world Glukhovsky created is presented in fine form here, visually through a claustrophobic web of crumbling tunnels and a ruined surface populated by mutated abominations, and narratively with a story that examines fascism and communism, prejudice and the pursuit of power. As a result, the gameplay almost becomes a slave to the story but despite this, Last Light is a delight. The survival horror and FPS elements complement each other as well here as they did in the original, with the urge to blast every flickering shadow tempered only by the scarcity of resources. A superb effort, written and presented with a skill that proves games can be both as complex and rewarding as any other art form.",

    "text": "The announcement of the Higher Education Commission&apos;s independent inquiry into postgraduate education is a promising sign that this important part of the university sector will finally get some attention. The future of postgraduate study was neglected in both the Browne review and the government&apos;s white paper. And the inquiry team has been asked to examine not only the importance of postgraduate education in maintaining Britain&apos;s knowledge economy, but also, significantly, the thorny issue of funding for students. The 2010 review led by Professor Sir Adrian Smith concluded that the skills of postgraduates, especially researchers, are &quot;critical for tackling major business challenges and driving innovation and growth&quot;. His review also highlighted the potential for &quot;upskilling&quot; and retraining the UK workforce. Postgraduate fees have historically been artificially pegged at a level close to undergraduate fees for home/EU students. It is very likely that the rise in undergraduate fees will lead to a rise in postgraduate fees, so a sustainable and affordable mechanism for providing financial support to postgraduate students will be essential. The cost of postgraduate education was identified in 2009 as a real barrier to social mobility by the Panel On Fair Access to The Professions. It found existing schemes for financial support to enable access to be wholly inadequate, and hardly used by UK students. The introduction of a loans system similar to that available to undergraduates may offer a solution. Australia, where I have spent much of the last 20 years, has seen an expansion in postgraduate participation from both international and domestic students, with a growth of over 12% in postgrad enrolments between 2005 and 2010. Like the UK, Australia only directly supports a small number of postgraduate taught education students studying courses of national priority (teaching and nursing, for example). However, their postgraduates are also eligible for student loans under the Higher Education Loans Programme (Help). The loan for postgraduates is called Fee-Help. This is a lifetime maximum loan, but can be used at different times throughout an individual&apos;s career. It is available for most but not all postgraduate courses, with loan debts administered by the tax office and repaid directly through the tax system. Significantly, Australia has integrated the postgraduate loan support system with that for undergraduate study. Most domestic undergraduate students are entitled to a maximum length of study at capped fee levels, with the ability to draw on a different type of Help loan. But students who are not eligible for this, or who use up all of their entitlement, can then draw on the Fee-Help loan. Translating one country&apos;s system to another is not always straightforward, but the principle of providing an integrated system of flexible access to loans throughout an individual&apos;s career has a lot of merit. It opens up lifetime opportunities for career advancement to many who may have missed out earlier and enables people to respond positively to changes in their employment opportunities. It also offers the control of a lifetime loan &quot;cap&quot; that would be attractive to governments wishing to manage the costs of supporting higher education. In the UK, a single &quot;capped&quot; loan scheme could be introduced for domestic students covering both undergraduate and postgraduate learning and available whenever students take up their studies. Such a system would improve access to postgraduate education for all and help strengthen one of the key elements of our knowledge economy.  Don Nutbeam is vice-chancellor of Southampton University",

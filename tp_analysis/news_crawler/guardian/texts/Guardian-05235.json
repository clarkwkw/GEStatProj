    "text": "    This week&apos;s element, iodine, is probably much more familiar to you than some of the previous ones we&apos;ve talked about recently. Iodine is designated by the symbol, I, and the atomic number, 53, and its name comes from the Greek word for violet or purple, which is the colour of elemental iodine vapor.  Purple? you ask.  Yes, purple. This character alone makes iodine fun since not only is it a departure from the usual variations on the grey colour theme for most elements, but it is a radical departure into purple. In addition, crystals of elemental iodine are quite attractive, being black and shiny.    Iodine is used industrially as a catalyst to speed up other chemical reactions, particularly the production of commercial quantities of acetic acid (vinegar), as well as having a variety of applications in the pharmaceutical industry. But iodine&apos;s primary importance is biological: it is an essential element for animals. The thyroid gland synthesizes several hormones, triiodiothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), which contain the element. For this reason, and also because iodine is fairly rare, the thyroid gland concentrates iodine. Normally, this is a good thing, but this can pose a problem when the body is flooded with radioactive isotopes of iodine. Accumulations of iodine radioisotopes, particularly iodine-131, which has a half-life of 8 days, are carcinogenic to the thyroid gland. This is the reason for providing the public with potassium iodide tablets after a nuclear disaster such as the Fukushima accident, because providing the body with a large influx of the nonradioactive I-127 isotope saturates the thyroid gland so it cannot absorb radioisotopes of iodine.  Iodine is present as water-soluble ions in seawater, sea salt, and in a number of marine plants, particularly kelp. But far from the coasts, in inland and mountainous regions of the world, iodine deficiency is a preventable public-health tragedy. Since the thyroid hormones, T3 and T4, regulate the genes that orchestrate growth, development, and metabolism in animals, iodine deficiencies have serious consequences: it is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation, goiter (known as &quot;Derbyshire Neck&quot; in parts of the UK) and it contributes to development of a number of cancers. These public health issues can be easily remedied by adding iodine to salt, flour, water and milk in areas of deficiency. Further, the cost of adding iodine to foods is negligible, but the social aftermath of not doing so are enormous, leading to billions of dollars in health care expenditures every year. Surprisingly, some countries -- most notably Russia -- have not implemented government programmes designed to remedy iodine deficiencies in their citizens.  Iodine is an essential element for other animals, too -- most dramatically, amphibians. T3 and T4 regulate genes that control metamorphosis from aquatic water-breathing tadpoles into terrestrial air-breathing adults. Tadpoles that suffer an iodine deficiency remain tadpoles until the end of their days. Interestingly, aquatic salamanders known as mudpuppies, Necturus maculosus, never undergo metamorphosis into the adult form, not because of an environmental iodine deficiency, but because they are resistant to the metamorphic effects of iodine and thyroid hormones [PMID: 16686639].

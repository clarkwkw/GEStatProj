    "text": "The first whispers of new life, the harbingers of spring, are tentatively appearing, flooding the land with colour, form and scent. The increasing warmth rouses trees and shrubs from their dormancy. One of the first signs to watch for is the emergence of golden hazel catkins. Very early in the year these male flowers stretch out, and once the females are open they release their pollen on the wind. They are also an important early food source for bees and other insects. Blackthorn brings its own, less chilly, winter to our hedgerows. The delicate white blooms flood the countryside, an event that often coincides with an early cold snap in spring. Their leaves follow after, whereas hawthorn unfurls its leaves before its flowers appear later in the season. Elder is another whose leaves flush early on. The silky buds of pussy willows transform into catkins, as evergreen yews develop their creamy flowers. The blossom of wild cherry graces our woods and purple tinged ash flowers appear. Rowan trees bring forth clusters of white-petaled flowers and silver birch catkins develop. Wych elm has the largest leaf of any native UK tree. As with blackthorn, the flowers appear before the leaves, in bunches of purple stamens. The diminutive crab apple and wayfaring trees bring colour to the land, while sycamores develop their hanging clusters of yellow green flowers. Spring is a wonderful time for British woodland flora. Before the tree canopies fully flush with new leaves, sunlight bathes the forest floor to encourage a wildflower paradise. Pendulous snowdrops are among the leading flowers of the new year  often braving the snow and ice. Once thought to be a UK native, they were not recorded in the wild until 1778 and are now classed as naturalised aliens. Later these give way to a sea of our much treasured bluebells, which can often be seen flowering alongside the rather more pungent ramsons, or wild garlic. Similarly, garlic mustard also releases a strong scent if crushed. Pioneering pale primroses can be found in woods and hedgerows. The charming flowers of red campion and common dog violet grow alongside elegant wood anemones and lesser celandine. Not all woods have such a wide range of wildflowers, but some ancient woods, which are among the UK&apos;s rarest and most special habitats, are home to a huge array of these beautiful plants. Cuckoo flowers can be found in boggier areas, while oak and ash woods play host to wild daffodils  not to be confused with their larger non-native cousins. Later in spring, yellow archangels flourish with deep blue bugles, distinctive lords and ladies and early purple orchids. Our woods offer delights all year round, but spring is the true jewel in the woodland crown. The Woodland Trust&apos;s Nature&apos;s Calendar offers interactive maps to show when and where many seasonal events are occurring. This information is very valuable but it relies on eager recorders to log their sightings. In this way, everyone can contribute to the UK&apos;s largest survey to assess the impact weather and climate change is having on our flora and fauna.

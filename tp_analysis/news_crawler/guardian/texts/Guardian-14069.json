    "text": "Games out this week include Luigi&apos;s Mansion 2 (3DS), the delightful puzzle game in which Mario&apos;s younger, slimmer brother trembles his way through haunted houses in search of ghosts and treasure; Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14 (Xbox, PS3), in its desperate struggle for novelty in this 14th incarnation, lets you play golf at night (just what you&apos;ve always wanted), and travel back in time to chance your arm against golfing greats such as Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus; Ghost Recon: Anthology (Xbox, PS3, PC) brings together every single version of the splendidly playable lightly tactical shooter up to its most recent outing, Future Soldier; and finally Finding Nemo: Escape To The Big Blue Special Edition (3DS) is the 3D remake of a 2006 game  inspired by the ever-popular Pixar film  that was itself a remake of a 2003 collection of mini-games which seemed a bit lame, even back then. If this one gets milked any harder, it&apos;s liable to turn inside out.",

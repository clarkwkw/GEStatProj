    "text": "     Scientists have developed a new kind of vaccine that could prevent devastating outbreaks of foot and mouth disease among livestock. The &quot;synthetic&quot; vaccine was created by taking protein shells that encase the virus and strengthening them, so the vaccine can be used in warm countries without refrigeration. The technique overcomes major shortcomings of existing foot and mouth vaccines, which are made with live virus. The infectious risk means the conventional vaccine must be produced in high containment facilities, which are costly to build and maintain. Vaccines made from the live virus are also fragile, and degrade unless they are kept cool. Since the new vaccine can be made in standard laboratories and is resilient to heat, it can be produced and transported in poor countries where foot and mouth is endemic. Bryan Charleston, head of livestock viral diseases at the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, said the vaccine could be used to control outbreaks in Asia, Africa, and parts of South America, where the virus is widespread. The devastating foot and mouth outbreak that struck Britain in 2001 was traced to a virus that emerged from Asia. The outbreak cost the UK an estimated 8bn. In 2010, South Korea and Japan suffered major outbreaks of the virus. Guidelines laid down by the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs, require farmers to slaughter animals on affected farms to contain the virus. The secretary of state can sanction the use of vaccines, but doing so extends the time taken for the country to return to &quot;disease-free status&quot;. &quot;We should try and control the infection at source by reducing the amount of virus in circulation, rather than waiting for an outbreak,&quot; said Charleston. Some three to four billion doses of foot and mouth vaccine are administered worldwide every year. &quot;We want to try and get this vaccine distributed and used worldwide,&quot; Charleston said. With large scale trials and regulatory approval, the vaccine could take six to eight years to become commercially available. Early trials have shown that shots of the new vaccine protect cattle as effectively as existing vaccines for up to 34 weeks. Scientists are now improving the vaccine to protect animals for a year. Details of the work are published in the journal, Plos Pathogens. The Pirbright scientists had help from a team at the Diamond Light Source near Oxford, who used x-rays to verify that the synthetic vaccine closely matched the structure of the virus. The work is expected to lead to other synthetic vaccines against a range of viruses, including some that affect humans, such as polio, and hand, foot and mouth disease.",

    "text": "Nineties puzzler Lemmings became an early cultural totem for the gaming industry, embraced by both the casual and hardcore market, as people sought to protect, and sometimes blow up, the suicidal little green-haired rodents. So comparing Band Together to the classic puzzler is high praise indeed. Set in a beautifully drawn 2D cardboard world, the aim is to lead the cute paper Bandies  so called because they band together around light  towards the exit of 30 different cardboard box levels. One Bandi wears a candle on its head and by pushing it around you illuminate others, whereupon they join the troupe on the quest through the perilous box. Various simple puzzles must be solved, with complex combinations of lever and pressure pads used to free up the creatures, while the deadly &quot;thumbtack death machines&quot; must be avoided to get as many of the group as possible to the exit alive. They can be controlled as a groupor individuals, but move a Bandi out of the light and it will drift off to sleep and remain motionless. It looks stunning and plays fantastically and, while it&apos;s a shame it isn&apos;t available for either the iPhone or the iPad 1, the main problem is that it&apos;s over so quickly, with the 30 stages swiftly completed. It&apos;s cheap for now, but expect either in-app purchases or a higher price tag to arrive in the future, along with some extra content for this fantastic little game.",

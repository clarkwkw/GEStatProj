    "text": "The accomplishments of Rev Richard Coles  writer, broadcaster, chart-topping musician with the Communards, and now Vicar of Finedon, Northants  are so diverse that it came as no surprise to discover life&apos;s cleanest pleasure among them. He has, he tells me, &quot;always loved cycling&quot;. From his earliest cycling experiences, &quot;I liked that it took you further than your unaided legs would go.&quot; Turning points in his life have often been reached by bike. &quot;I once ran away on a fat-tyred little bike and got as far as Martin&apos;s the newsagent on the new estate before turning back,&quot; he recalls. &quot;One Christmas (1974?) I got an orange Raleigh Chopper and that was my first experience of &apos;cool&apos;.&quot; He has always enjoyed exploring by bike. &quot;When I was fit and had the time, I used to cycle a lot, touring round Northamptonshire and off-road biking with Smiffy and Alison and a slightly mad bloke whose name I can&apos;t remember who used to cheerfully cycle off precipices without looking. He told me a highly indecent joke about George Michael I&apos;ve never forgotten. It still makes me laugh.&quot; God is also in his thoughts when he&apos;s cycling. Like many cyclists, he finds time in the saddle a great opportunity for reflection. &quot;One of my most enduring memories is cycling from Grafton underwood to Slipton on a sunny winter&apos;s day and being struck, out of the blue, by a sense of the presence of God and that all would be well. More common is problem-solving. If I can&apos;t quite get something to work out, I cycle on it. Forward motion under one&apos;s own steam seems to work for me.&quot; Today he often combines cycling with trips in his camper van. He and his partner take a pair of Bromptons  &quot;the finest achievement in British engineering since the Holborn viaduct&quot;  to cycle wherever they park up. They have explored Britain thoroughly. &quot;I love it round here in Northamptonshire  good cycling country  but I think we&apos;d like to end up in Norfolk eventually. Scotland we love too, and try to take the van and the bikes up to the west coast once a year.&quot; Closer to home, Coles has rekindled his affection for Finedon, his current parish, while out cycling. &quot;I&apos;ve known Finedon all my life, but rediscovered it on my bike in recent years. I remember seeing the vicarage I now live in and thinking, &apos;in another life I would have loved to be here&apos;.&quot; He adds that in Finedon, the bike is an &quot;indispensable ministerial tool. I&apos;m visible, but I&apos;m not stopping, so if I have a lot to do and I&apos;m half-time in a parish which could use my full-time attention  I can sail by with a cheery salutation,&quot; he explains. &quot;Most people like to see the vicar out and about, I think.&quot; I ask Cole how he regards the church&apos;s stance on environmental issues. Though the Bishop of London, among others, has made the environment a priority, at local level the car tends to dominate. (In Westminster recently, several churches campaigned against the extension of parking restrictions.) As John Major infamously observed, the church has traditionally welcomed cycling: &quot;I&apos;d love to see old maids cycling to evensong,&quot; Coles says, &quot;but round here they&apos;re more likely to come on a mobility scooter. We don&apos;t really have a problem with cars because most distances in Finedon are walkable. Or scootable. As a church we try to be as environmentally responsible as possible  we are, after all, stewards of God&apos;s creation, so more nurture, less exploitation would be good.&quot; With his rare combination of showbiz experience and the Church of England, Coles has been advising actor Tom Hollander in his role as Adam Smallbone in the BBC2 sitcom Rev. &quot;I have helped Hollander with getting the technical stuff right. He was rather crestfallen when I once said he wielded his aspergillum like a Methodist.&quot; We agree that for a comedy filmed in Shoreditch, they&apos;d be foolish not to have a cycling episode, in which Adam Smallbone, perhaps with Colin and Adoha, learns to cycle with the local fixed-gear posse, then goes on a critical mass ride. Coles is not persuaded that the deliciously intimidating archdeacon could be cut down to size a little by spending more time on a bike and less in the back of a cab. &quot;He&apos;s a very cab account sort of cleric  more likely to be seen on rollerblades than a bike. In Fire Island, perhaps?&quot; he suggests. But Coles has less sympathy for the procession of intimidating characters in dark vehicles down the road, at the Royal Courts of Justice. &quot;I think one of the most enduring spectacles from the phone-hacking scandal has been the editors and proprietors and cops turning up to give evidence at the Leveson inquiry in black Range Rovers. They make them look like Balkan warlords  horrible,&quot; he says. Though he resists the idea that cyclists are by definition any humbler, and won&apos;t be drawn on my fanciful parallel between the bike and the biblical donkey, symbol of humility. &quot;I&apos;ve found cyclists to be no less prey to human frailty than motorists,&quot; Coles says, &quot;so I would hesitate to draw a direct parallel between two wheels and virtue.&quot; Aged 18, Coles was badly injured after being knocked off his bike by &quot;a careless driver&quot;  &quot;that was the injury for which I got compensation and bought a saxophone  the beginning of my career in the music industry,&quot; he points out  and was so nervous of the road afterwards that he &quot;would flinch if a lorry passed as I walked along the pavement&quot;. While it made him &quot;more aware of how vulnerable cyclists are&quot;, he sees fault on both sides. &quot;Considerate driving  and cycling  is rarer now than it used to be,&quot; he suggests. &quot;There&apos;s more competition for space on the road and a general attitude of &apos;fuck you&apos; doesn&apos;t help. Cyclists not abiding by the law or the highway code does nothing to ameliorate that.&quot; He ends with an aspiration we should all share; one far too easily lost in the normalisation of road injury and death. &quot;I think all road users are responsible for creating safer environments for cyclists  and reducing to zero the number of fatalities should be our urgent priority,&quot; he says.",

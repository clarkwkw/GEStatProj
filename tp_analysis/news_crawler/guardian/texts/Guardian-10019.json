Click here to view  The Professor&apos;s annual outing is by now routine, taking in charming hand-drawn artwork and gentlemanly conduct from Layton and his youthful assistant, Luke, this time joined by chipper tag-along, Emmy. Pursuing a mysterious masked criminal who seems to be turning tourists to stone and bringing paintings to life, you progress by solving a succession of lightly brain-teasing puzzles. The 3D looks lovely, challenges feel fresh and despite how well-worn the Professor&apos;s schtick is becoming, it works well enough that you can&apos;t feel too miffed about its almost total absence of innovation.

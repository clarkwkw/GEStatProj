    "text": "An academic high-flyer, Sophie Dalby achieved top A-level grades and offers of places from five universities. But much to the surprise of staff at her school  who had expected her to go to university  she chose to take up an apprenticeship with accountancy firm BDO instead. Her decision was largely motivated by the recent rise in tuition fees (now around 9,000 a year in many institutions). &quot;It&apos;s put a lot of people off,&quot; she explains. &quot;The scheme I am on is equivalent to a degree, so I will be fully qualified by the time I am 23. Unlike a degree, everything is paid for; we are training quicker and learning the skills employers are after.&quot; Huge government investment in apprenticeships (around 1.5bn in the past year alone) means there are now more apprenticeship opportunities for young people in a growing number of sectors, ranging from supply chain management to agriculture. And far from being an alternative route for those who aren&apos;t academic, apprenticeships offer learning and career opportunities for all young people. While apprenticeships start at level 2 (GCSE equivalent), higher level apprenticeships (HLAs), which are equivalent to degree-level qualifications and beyond are increasingly commonplace. Last year, there were 3,700 HLAs available (up by 67.6% on the previous year), and for school-leavers in 2013, HLAs will span 41 subject areas. Dalby is working towards a new level 7 (master&apos;s degree level) HLA developed by the professional services firm PwC, in partnership with other businesses in the financial sector. It covers accountancy, auditing and tax and is the first to provide a work-based route to chartered professional status. Other newly launched HLAs include a degree-level course in management accounting (due to be launched in September), a level 4 course in legal services, and a degree-level space engineering qualification. The global engineering company Siemens is also embracing HLAs, offering courses in engineering, project management, business administration, IT and finance. The firm currently has 300 apprentices across all levels, 80 of whom are working towards HLAs. &quot;School-leavers bring a new dynamic,&quot; says Joanne Gogerly, finance and commercial skills consultant at Siemens. &quot;They&apos;re not afraid to question, they&apos;re fantastic to work with. They&apos;re just as talented as some of the graduates.&quot; The skills minister, Matthew Hancock, has praised the growth of HLAs and said he wants to see more programmes being developed: &quot;It should be the norm that students either go to university or on to an apprenticeship scheme when they leave school.&quot; Following National Apprenticeships Week (an annual celebration of the impact apprenticeships have on individuals and businesses) in March, employers across the UK have pledged to recruit around 13,600 more apprentices at all levels. A recent study of 500 employers carried out on behalf of the National Apprenticeships Service found that employers in England rate higher level apprentices as 15% &quot;more employable&quot; than those who took alternative routes. Notably, they were ranked higher than people with degrees. BDO currently has 50 young people on its HLA programme across audit, tax and other areas. After two years, they will be awarded a level 4 (degree equivalent) apprenticeship with a further three years&apos; study leading to level 7 (master&apos;s level). Alana McCrosson, student recruitment manager at BDO, says there may eventually be a 50:50 recruitment ratio between graduates and apprenticeships. &quot;We&apos;re still bringing in lots of fantastic graduates, but the school-leavers are more than capable of working at the same level. They get the exact same career, the exact same qualifications and the exact same long-term options.&quot; Is university worthwhile? Alexandra Causer,18, Canterbury I was going to go to university, but I wanted to be sure I&apos;m making the right decision before I commit, so I&apos;ve deferred my place until next year. It&apos;s so expensive and there are no job guarantees afterwards, but I do like the idea of the university experience, especially the socialising. Sophie Mason, 16, Liverpool I&apos;m interested in fashion design, so I want to do a degree in London. I want to experience living somewhere different and be near all the fashion shows. I don&apos;t like the idea of getting into debt, but you don&apos;t have to pay it back until you&apos;re earning a certain amount  and that could be years away. Finn Guthrie, 18, Faversham Personally, university is not for me. I&apos;ve already been promised a tattoo apprenticeship but first I&apos;ll do an art foundation course to refine my drawing skills. I find university tuition fees extortionate and off-putting. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there&apos;s a lot you can gain from university  but for certain careers it&apos;s not necessary. Aaron Sher Gill, 15, Luton I want to get the best job possible and I believe university provides you with the education to do so. I also enjoy studying, but I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;ll do at university yet. People say university is expensive, but I think it&apos;s an investment in your future.

    "text": "My daughter uses Blogger to keep a wonderful record of her toddler&apos;s &quot;Life and Times&quot;. This is all the more precious to those with whom she shares it as she lives abroad. I worry about future-proofing this material and wonder if you have any advice on capturing the blog and perhaps saving it in more tangible formats. David Marshall This is a great use of a blog, and there are lots of different ways you could preserve it. For example, you could save each page as file and print the resulting files in colour. This would make the blog accessible offline and sharable in much the same way as snapshots, with the files you have saved providing a separate backup. Every browser should have a &quot;File Save&quot; routine somewhere, or a &quot;Save page as&quot; command like Google Chrome. Both Microsoft&apos;s Internet Explorer and Opera provide a handy way to do this: they let you save pages in a standards-based MHTML format. In IE, use the Save option called &quot;Web archive, single file (*.mht)&quot;. This saves a page as a single file rather than saving the page&apos;s HTML as one file and all the other elements  images, scripts etc  in a separate folder. (HTML, HyperText Markup Language, is the language used to create most web pages. The M comes from MIME, or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. MHTML is shortened to .mht to identify these files.)  There&apos;s also a Firefox extension called UnMHT, which adds MHT file support to Firefox. Another extension, Mozilla Archive Format, will save pages in either MHT or MAFF (Mozilla Archive Format File). You can get similar plug-ins for most popular browsers. Another quick way to make a tangible record is to select and copy a hefty chunk of the blog and paste into a Microsoft Word document (docx). This will copy panels and pictures as well as text. The results tend to be a bit mixed, but sometimes it works very well. You can also try capturing each page as an image, if you have an image capture program that will snapshot whole web pages, not just the parts currently on screen. Of course, if it&apos;s a large blog, saving or copying one page at a time soon becomes tedious. Also, saving individual pages loses the structure of the blog. Programs known as &quot;site rippers&quot; solve both problems by copying (ripping) whole sites and downloading them to a folder on your PC&apos;s hard drive.  Site rippers were in vogue in the early days of the web, when people were paying by the minute to dial up and read web pages online. It was relatively quick and easy to rip a small website so that you could read it offline. Thanks to ubiquitous broadband, there&apos;s not much call for that nowadays. Also, today&apos;s bigger and more complicated websites are harder to rip than simple HTML sites. One survivor is HTTrack Website Copier, an open source site ripper that works on Microsoft Windows and Linux. There&apos;s a YouTube video that shows how to use it. Spadix Software&apos;s BackStreet Browser 3.2 for Windows looks easier to use. There&apos;s also the WinWSD WebSite Downloader, which you can download from CNet and other sites, but the author&apos;s home page no longer works. Things are different if you own a Blogger blog, or at least have a password to access the dashboard. In this case, you can go to Settings (the spanner icon), click on Other, and then choose &quot;Export blog&quot;. This will save a back-up copy of the whole blog to your hard drive in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format.  It&apos;s important to do this in case you inadvertently run into a dreaded &quot;policy violation&quot; and Google deletes your blog. Note that to get a proper backup, you have to download a backup copy of your blog&apos;s Template as well. A Blogger backup isn&apos;t very useful, but if you double-click the .xml file, it will load into a browser, such as IE. If you scroll down past the confusing headers, you should find the readable text of each post, but it&apos;s no substitute for the original blog. And while you could import your .xml file into Blogger or the WordPress blogging system, you could still only read it online. At this point, I&apos;m stuck for a suggestion. One idea, which I haven&apos;t tried, would be to install a copy of WordPress on your PC and import the Blogger backup into that. It&apos;s quite a lot of work and might not be worth the effort. Perhaps a reader can suggest a better idea for offline reading. Finally, there are online services that will back up a blog, or convert it into an ebook or even a printed book. Again, there may be limits on what you can do unless you have access to the Blogger dashboard. The BlogBackupr website will back up a blog on a daily basis, using its RSS feed. ZinePal will convert a blog into a PDF file and into an ebook in the Amazon Kindle, Mobipocket and ePub formats. However, it will only convert five blog posts unless you sign up for the Pro version, which will convert 50. One ebook costs $5. BookSmith will convert up to 100 posts from Blogger or WordPress into an ebook, and offer you the chance to buy a printed copy. However, you have to give it your logon and password. BlogBooker will convert a Blogger, WordPress or LiveJournal blog into a PDF ebook. This looks a decent bet because you can upload your Blogger backup (.xml) file. However, the site is &quot;donationware&quot; and, quite reasonably, requests a donation if you want to include images. I tried BlogBooker with an old blog and the result is quite book-like with an index at the front, different chapters for different years, left/right page spacing, headers/footers and so on. It also included comments. With an automated spacing and layout system, there are bound to be errors that a human editor would correct, but still, if you like the result, you can get the PDF printed by Lulu. Either way, it&apos;s better than nothing. I also tried PDF my URL, because it only involves pasting in the blog&apos;s web address. Almost instantly, the site created a paginated PDF copy that looked like my original Blogger site, with colour panels etc. However, it only picked up the last 15 of 67 posts, and no comments. If you want to modify the settings, you have to sign up for a paid subscription. If there are better services out there, please tell us about them in the comments.",

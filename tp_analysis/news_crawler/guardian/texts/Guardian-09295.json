    "text": "It&apos;s a rare day that isn&apos;t blustery on the switchback crest of the Whin Sill and today is windy as usual. This dogged line of rock tilts across the upland landscape, its north-facing cliffs surmounted by Hadrian&apos;s Wall. We set off from the wood-sheltered car park at Steel Rigg to follow the dips and curves of the Roman wall. From a reedy hollow, the stone-flagged path leads up a steep climb known as Cat Stairs. Halfway up, a farm wall traverses the hillside with a narrow gap for a stile, through which we edge sideways. To left and right in the cool shelter of jumbled rocks grow ferns, wood sage, foxglove, honeysuckle: the woodland plants co-existing with plants of the open, heather and rock rose. Looking down on to Peel Crag and its needle, known as Pinnacle Face by climbers, ash and hawthorn trees have rooted in the sparse soil. Hadrian&apos;s Wall runs along the top of the ridge, its regular stones topped by turf, a preservation method used by the 19th-century archaeologist John Clayton. The view is expansive: to the south the softer lands of Tyne and Allen valleys, to the north the dark crouching line of conifers that is Wark Forest. Dry bracken rustles among the turf capping. Our senses are filled by the buffeting of the wind, the susurration of the grasses and the sharp cries of jackdaws as they are tossed about like black rags. On the skyline a rust-roofed barn is hunkered down under a smudge of rainbow. Then it&apos;s more sharp dips and steep climbs before our goal: a sudden view of the dark waters of Crag Lough. On this autumn day its surface is metallic blue, flecked grey by scuds of wind. From its southern edge the Whin Sill soars near vertically. The composition is perfect  the sky-reflecting lake, the fluted cliffs rising from a scree-filled base, the distant farm with its protective woods and the grey ribbon of the Roman wall.",

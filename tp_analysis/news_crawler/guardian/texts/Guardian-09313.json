Photograph: Flickr    A recently published study by Newcastle University and the Wellcome Trust has revealed interactions between the auditory cortex and amygdala, which suggests a mechanism for why we find some sounds so unpleasant. For the record, I&apos;m sure an announcement triggering news stories about unpleasant sounds coinciding with David Cameron&apos;s speech was just a coincidence. The auditory cortex, as the name suggests, is responsible for processing audio stimuli, or &apos;sounds&apos; as they&apos;re more commonly known. The amygdala, by contrast, is responsible for processing the emotional component of our experiences. &quot;Amygdala&quot; is Latin for almond, because that&apos;s what it looks like. The basic system of naming neurological regions seems to be asking &quot;what does it look like?&quot; followed by &quot;what&apos;s that in Latin?&quot; like some squishy ancient Roman version of Pictionary. The amygdala plays a constant and important role in our daily lives. For example, imagine I&apos;m giving a lecture to disinterested students. Half way through, I decide to liven things up and ask a student in the front row a question. As I turn to him, my belt snaps and my trousers fall down, revealing Christmas-themed boxer shorts that I&apos;m wearing due to not doing any laundry as a result of preparing for the lecture. I reflexively bend down to pull my trousers up, but forget my position and accidentally head-butt the student. He is knocked unconscious and collapses forward. I&apos;m dazed by the impact too, but my trousers are still around my ankles so I end up toppling forward, onto the prone student. At this point my boss walks in, to see me, trousers down, on top of one of the students. Such an experience, if it happened (and it genuinely hasn&apos;t, I promise) would be mortifyingly embarrassing for me, and every time I remember it or think of it I&apos;d no doubt be overcome by a nearly crippling sense of shame and embarrassment. The amygdala is what does this; it gives memories their emotional component, which is a crucial element of learning, teaching us that some things are pleasant (e.g. good food sources) and should be sought out, and some things are unpleasant and dangerous (e.g. predators, poisoned food), and should be avoided. If I had no amygdala, I would have still been embarrassed by the instant as it happened, but I wouldn&apos;t remember that element of it. My memory of it would be essentially neutral, as if I&apos;d catalogued it away as &quot;Trousers-down Christmas-pants Apparent-assault incident no. 396.b&quot; (If I don&apos;t learn the negative consequences of the event, there&apos;s no reason I wouldn&apos;t end up repeating it) But the recent study suggests there are some sounds that we find intrinsically unpleasant, and in response to these the amygdala appears to directly modulate the auditory cortex, heightening our perception of sounds we find unpleasant. Only 13 participants were used, so it&apos;s not too encompassing, but interesting nonetheless, for numerous reasons. Much of the media attention has focussed on the 5 sounds that participants found most unpleasant. These were: Knife on glass bottle. Fork on glass. Chalk on a blackboard. Ruler on a bottle. Fingernails on a blackboard. From this list, it would be easy to conclude that humans are predisposed to hate glass and blackboards. However, the link above describes them as the most unpleasant sounds in &quot;everyday Life&quot;. In all honesty, when was the last time someone would have heard these sounds in daily life? Blackboards are regarded as quite old school these days (no pun intended).  Also, &quot;ruler on bottle&quot;? How often does anyone aggressively measure a bottle? Although admittedly, this sounds like exactly the sort of thing that would come up in the lab that performed the study. Some poor overworked and underpaid postgrad, on their 18th cup of coffee, having to check all the bottles are the same length the night before the experiment, to ensure consistency, eventually snaps and starts attacking them with the nearest instrument to hand, creating a rather unpleasant sound.  Interestingly, all the unpleasant sounds fall within the 2000-5000 hertz range, suggesting we are predisposed to find this range unpleasant. It may be to do with human screams, which are usually within this range. Baby cries are often cited as one of the most distressing sounds, and as a father of a 7 month old I can confirm this. Perhaps we&apos;ve evolved to find these sounds unpleasant in order to compel us to put a stop to them as soon as possible? This would have to be counterbalanced by our evolved desire to look after our young, though. There are probably many &quot;immediate&quot; ways to silence a baby, but the majority of those are unlikely to take the baby&apos;s safety into account so wouldn&apos;t be any use in preserving the species. Another theory I&apos;ve heard is that we have evolved to find this sort of sound unpleasant as it reminds us of the cries of sabre toothed cats and the like. Exactly how these people know what sabre toothed cats sounded like is anyone&apos;s guess. Perhaps they have access to a time machine, so could observe them directly? But saying that, if you&apos;re a scientist who invents a working time machine in order to achieve scientific success by pursuing your theories about unpleasant noises, observation clearly isn&apos;t something you&apos;re good at.  But maybe these are learned responses, rather than intrinsic? It&apos;s impossible to say that the subjects hadn&apos;t encountered high pitched noises in unpleasant contexts before the study. I remember being told several times that there is no noise worse than nails on a blackboard, but this was before I&apos;d heard it, so was primed to find it unpleasant when I did. Context is also important. A mild cough is usually a fairly irrelevant sound, but if you&apos;re in a cinema or theatre, it can be maddening. I quite like the Geordie accent, especially when employed by loveable scamps Ant and Dec, but I can&apos;t abide it when it is delivered via the medium of Cheryl Cole.  Overall, an interesting study, albeit one that I imagine may produce different results if repeated in 30 years&apos; time, when the least popular noises will probably be something like autotuning, the Nokia Ringtone and anyone singing &apos;Go Compare!&apos; Although one last part does confuse me. Apparently the connection between the auditory cortex and amygdala in response to unpleasant noises were revealed via fMRI. As someone who has taken part in numerous fMRI experiments, I would say the best place to be if you wish to be bombarded by very loud high-pitched unpleasant noises is INSIDE AN fMRI SCANNER! I&apos;m baffled as to how the experimenters managed to filter out all the high pitched noises in order to expose subjects to some high pitched noises.  But unless they made the whole study up, they did. Isn&apos;t science brilliant! Dean Burnett considers his own voice to be a deeply unpleasant noise, so avoid it entirely by following him on Twitter, @garwboy",

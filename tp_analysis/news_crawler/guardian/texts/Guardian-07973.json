    "text": "Of all interactive entertainment genres, the fighting game seems to provoke the strongest sense of community and identity from its fan base. While first-person shooters attract a larger competitive audience, the likes of Street Fighter, Tekken and Virtua Fighter seem to inspire something more, something akin to a true subculture, with its own language, meeting places and sense of visual style. Publishers like Namco and Capcom are experts at capitalising on this, hence the &quot;We Are Tekken&quot; Instagram competition, which is running throughout August. UK gamers are being encouraged to send in snapshots of what Tekken means to them. The best images are then to be displayed at Shoreditch&apos;s Protein gallery from 13-16 September. The photos are pretty interesting, ranging from little pieces of Tekken art to photos of people playing the game. The image above, submitted by cy4n1de, shows a doodle drawn by his girlfriend while he and a friend played Tekken 6. You can find out more information about the competition and the exhibition here, and you can check the #wearetekken Instagram gallery here.",

Nikon D5000, 1/320s f/4.0 at 300.0mm iso200   Question: This mystery bird and its congeners have a special trait that is rare amongst its family members. What trait is that? Can you name any other family members that share this trait? Can you name this mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is a green magpie, Cissa chinensis, a member of the crow (corvidae) family. This individual bird is placed into the genus, Cissa, which consists of three or so Asian magpies that are primarily green, which is an unusual plumage colour amongst corvids. That said, only after I wrote the mystery bird question for you did I remember that there is yet another green-plumed corvid, one that is only distantly related to the Cissa species; the green jay, Cyanocorax yncas, a lovely Mexican bird with green upperparts. So I think I&apos;ve identified all the primarily green corvids.  The green magpie lives in lowland evergreen forests, bamboo forests, and scrub ranging from northeastern India and down into central Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra and northwestern Borneo. Wild individuals tend to avoid open areas and will stay under the cover of vegetation. Like all corvids, this species is primarily carnivorous, consuming a variety of invertebrates, as well as young birds and eggs, small reptiles and mammals.  This species has brilliant emerald green upperparts and slightly paler green underparts, reddish-brown wings, a bold black stripe that extends from the bill and through its dark eyes all the way to its nape and a very long white-tipped tail. Areas of bare skin are bright red; its eye rims, bill and legs. It can be distinguished from the its congeners, the Indochinese green magpie, C. hypoleuca and the recent-splits, the Javan green magpie, C. thalassina, and the Bornean green magpie, C. jefferyi, by its noticeably longer tail, by its distinctive tertial pattern and (in the case of the Indochinese green magpie) by its green rather than yellow underparts. There also is little range overlap, which is important to know when identifying these sedentary species.  Green magpies&apos; green feathers will fade to turquoise-blue when frequently exposed to the sun. This is because green plumage colouration is produced by a combination of two sources: a special feather structure that produces blue colouring due the feather refracting light (known as schemochromes) combined with yellow carotenoids, a group of bio-pigments that come from the bird&apos;s diet. Captive birds and those wild individuals that spend a lot of time in the sun will fade to blue because carotenoids are destroyed by light (even the plumage colour of &quot;stuffed&quot; prepared bird specimens that are stored in dark museum drawers fades). Blue-coloured captive birds that are not kept outdoors are probably not getting enough carotenoids in their diet so they grow blue plumage when they moult. That said, it is worth mentioning that genetic blue plumage-colour variants do tend to pop up fairly frequently even in the wild. This colour variant is prized in aviculture, so is be selectively bred for when it does occur.  Here&apos;s a video of wild green magpies, bathing in a puddle on the forest floor in Thailand:            [video link].

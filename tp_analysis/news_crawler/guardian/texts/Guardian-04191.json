    "text": "From printing charges to bills for books and special equipment, student life comes with all sorts of extra and often unplanned-for costs. Many universities publish guidance for new students so you can factor these expenses into your budget but it&apos;s also a good idea to ask a current undergraduate which purchases are essential, and which you can do without. Receiving your first university reading list is an exciting experience, so it&apos;s tempting to buy every item mentioned, says Catherine Pearce, a third-year medic at Cardiff University. &quot;When I was accepted to study medicine I was so ecstatic that I went out and bought a model skull. I now live in a house full of medics  and rather unnecessarily we have one skull per person. I also own quite a lot of shiny, unopened textbooks.&quot; Faculty libraries are well stocked, so there&apos;s no need to buy every recommended book  and once you&apos;re registered as a student you can visit university libraries across the country through the Access scheme. Search for texts online Google books and Project Gutenberg have excellent archives  and use your university&apos;s facilities as much as possible. &quot;Once you settle in you soon pick up ways to save money,&quot; says Agnes Bataclan, a second-year photography student at the London College of Fashion. &quot;I book in advance to use university equipment and I avoid printing costs by handing work in digitally wheneverpossible.&quot; If you&apos;re concerned about costs you can alsoapply for a scholarship.

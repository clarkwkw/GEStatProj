    "text": "Universities have traditionally reached out to their alumni through hospitality events. Alex Smith, a member of the University of Leicester&apos;s Alumni Association, describes these as: &quot;&apos;homecoming days&apos;, networking events and swanky dinners.&quot; But in a rapidly changing sector, where students are expected to pay more, how will the demands on alumni change and what new tools can universities use to make convert graduates into active alumni? And while we&apos;re thinking about changes within the HE sector, it&apos;s worth mentioning that these are not the only ones that alumni relations staff have to contend with. Technology is revolutionising the way people interact and get their information. What impact will this have on alumni relations? Andy Shaindlin asks questions to this effect in a 2010 blog post on impact the growth of the web and alumni magazines. The associate vice president for alumni relations and annual giving at Carnegie Mellon University writes: &quot;The internet is not where printed content becomes immortal. It is, however, an increasingly interactive medium which points to new forms of alumni engagement.&quot; Vince Sweeny, vice-chancellor of university relations at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explores the potential of social networking in an article for the network: &quot;The most exciting piece is still ahead of us, and is unknown. How much do new &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;follows&quot; translate to engaged alumni who visit campus, follow our news and share their views and ideas with us?&quot; Many universities are already grappling with these questions and interesting projects are starting as a result. On Friday 29 June, we&apos;ll bring a panel together to share the innovative ways alumni relations professionals are developing what it means to be an alum, as well as explore the skills that are needed to thrive in this fast-changing environment.

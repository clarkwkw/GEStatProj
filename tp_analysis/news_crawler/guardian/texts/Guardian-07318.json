    "text": "As rumours swirl about concerning your possible departure from the Department for Education, it&apos;s difficult to know if this is an end of year or an end of school report. Either way, parents, pupils and most people who work in education stay at the school wheel longer than any secretary of state. We see you come and go like swallows, each one of you determined to make your mark on an institution that is more than capable of making its own marks, if given the chance. And marks you have made. Inyour short time in the post, you haven&apos;t just scribbled on a few bits of paper. You&apos;ve moved the furniture out and rearranged the landscape. I have a seven-year-old about to go into year 3 and I admit I am beginning to feel some anxiety about what&apos;s waiting for him over the next few years. As he is in alocal authority school, you seem to have lined up for him a regime of science without experiments, maths without problems and English without meaning. (More on this in a moment.) If you think his school isn&apos;t doing this properly, you can wave your wand and turn it into an academy where, mysteriously, his teachers wouldn&apos;t be bound so rigidly to this regime while being controlled directly by you and whichever unaccountable trust of worthies (or unworthies) happens to take over. Let it be said that this huge change to how this society educates its young has taken place without real public debate or choice. For many, it seems like a row in a monastery over who gets to buy the Bible. The press and TV have been strangely quiet about the torpedoing of democracy going on here, which I guess is just how you like it. So it is that it doesn&apos;t seem to have worried the fourth estate too much that you have found some small print that seems to give you and you alone the powers to remove locally elected people from the running of a school, that you and you alone become that authority, nor, under cover of the Olympic hoo-ha, have just fundamentally altered the terms of employment of teachers. You have unleashed on our children a new genre: the unqualified teacher. Maybe in your next job you will follow this up by giving us unqualified lawyers, unqualified surveyors, unqualified structural engineers, unqualified nurses and unqualified doctors. Then we can have parity of esteem, while sitting sick and broke among the ruins of faulty buildings. Why not? The market can determine who&apos;s good and who&apos;s bad at their job: the rich will get the best and the poor will get the worst. But isn&apos;t it the market that lies behindyour education revolution  or counter-revolution as I suspect you would call it? I have heard that the reason why your academies are free from your heavy-handed, overly directed curricula is so that they can buy their own curricula from the multinational suppliers waiting in the wings. You would know this only too well from your meetings with Rupert Murdoch (documented in February by David Leigh in this paper) in those heady days when it looked for one moment as if the whole apparatus of media, education and information was about to be handed over to his corporation? Yes, academies are free to spend our taxes on curricula-for-profit. So, where before teachers went shopping in the marketplace for books and materials to teach the curricula devised (for better or worse) by elected ministers and their experts, now these syllabuses will come as great chunks of online ready-mades. And isn&apos;t this precisely why you have brought in the unqualified teachers? To operate the machines in the education mills that will manufacture the schooled children. They will be 21stcentury factory &quot;hands&quot;. Meanwhile, back in the enemy heartlands, where, unlike some Tory-controlled areas, local authorities aren&apos;t handing over their schools to you, your justifications for the changes facing my youngest child are based on what? As Prof Stephen Krashen recently pointed out in a letter to this newspaper, there is no evidence to suggest that expensive, exclusive, intensive, systematic synthetic phonics teaching produces more or better readers who understand what they&apos;re reading than &quot;mixed methods&quot; (which include basic phonics); there is no evidence to suggest that teaching spelling using lists helps children spell better than if they read plenty of books; there is no evidence to suggest that teaching grammar rules to primary children helps them read or write better. There is also no evidence to suggest that children below year 5 cannot make predictions and usefully test them scientifically; there is no evidence to suggest that anyone benefits from mathematics without understanding. For these reasons, your end of year or end of school report is a disaster  I mean for us, of course. Yours, Michael Rosen",

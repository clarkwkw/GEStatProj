    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view It&apos;s London&apos;s turn to host the zombie apocalypse in this unexpectedly gritty undead outing for the Wii U. Taking control of a lone survivor, you eke out an existence amidst the rubble and small crowds of the howling infected, starting with little more than a cricket bat, a pistol and very few bullets. It takes several thumps of the willow to render a zombie supine, before a final crack over the head finishes them off, but when they arrive in a group your best bet is to run. Exploring is a frightening knife-edge between probing for new materials and staying close to shortcuts to your safe house (which scarily turns out not to be altogether safe). Grizzly and unrelenting, ZombiU is not for the faint-hearted.",

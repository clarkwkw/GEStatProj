    "text": "Can any economic entomologist come to my rescue? For two or three weeks I have been occasionally finding an interesting but destructive little beetle in two rooms in my house. Its name is Attagenus pellio, and it is said to feed upon furs, skins, and natural history specimens. Its larva is a quaint hairy thing, with a shaving-brush tuft of hair at the end of its tail, which aids it in its spasmodic and irregular movements. According to the late Dr Bailey, who some years ago was my valued referee for all questions relating to beetles, it is not common in Lancashire and Cheshire, but Fowler, after referring to its scientific tastes, says - &quot;usually in houses.&quot; Efficient spring-cleaning has revealed no damage done to furs or specimens, but I have just traced the location of the colony  the underside of the woodwork which covers the cistern. What I want to know is what it eats here? Does the larva live on dust, and how can I prevent it spreading to other parts of the house and doing serious damage?",

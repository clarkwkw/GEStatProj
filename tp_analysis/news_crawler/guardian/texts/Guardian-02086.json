    "text": "New privacy rules from Google, which come into effect on Thursday 1 March, will allow the company to pool data on individual users from any of its sites and use this to serve targetted advertising and search results. The changes will be investigated by EU authorities led by the French data protection watchdog CNIL, which claims the new policy breaches European law. According to reports, users cannot opt out of the new policy if they want to keep using Google&apos;s services, which include search, YouTube, Gmail and Google+. Are you concerned about these new rules? What questions do you have for Google about how the changes will affect you online? From 12-1pm GMT, Peter Barron, Google&apos;s director of external relations for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was online taking your questions, a selection of which are featured below. You asked, Google answered: charlie5 asks:  Google has pointed out that users can search anonymously or while logged out to avoid being tracked, as well as using separate accounts on different Google services to keep data diffused  although critics argue this makes for a clunky user experience. Users can also control their advertising preferences and make sure their web history is not tracked. Great to know. But how? This information is not eaily found on the google website or is it? Any advice or guidance on this would be appreciated.  Peter Barron answers:     Peter Barron, director of external relations, EMEA, Google    The best first stop is www.google.co.uk/privacy, where links to all our privacy tools are available, including links to our ads preferences manager and the instructions for clearing or stopping your search history if you search while logged in to a Google account. raskelfe comments:  Even with the best intentions of Google to ensure privacy. The centralisation of data not only makes it vulnerable to attack. It also makes it likely to be attacked and leaked onto the internet.  Peter Barron answers:     Peter Barron, director of external relations, EMEA, Google    We&apos;re keenly aware of the importance of keeping people&apos;s information safe, and helping them keep their information safe. We were the first webmail provider to switch to secure connections for all our users, and the first to offer two step verification (so that even if a hacker tricks you into divulging your password, they still won&apos;t be able to access your account). We work hard to make sure people know about these things: we recently launched a national advertising campaign on this topic called Good to Know. More on that www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow ThomasGreen2 asks:  Obviously this new privacy policy hasn&apos;t been an overnight decision, so why did you not first inform state bodies (such as the EU) to see if they had any privacy concerns before implementing this new policy?  Peter Barron responds:     Peter Barron, director of external relations, EMEA, Google    We&apos;ve been moving in this direction for some time. We announced in January that these changes were coming, and since then we have carried out a huge notifiication programme, including a email to every Google account holder, and lots of home page promos and landing pages, as well as briefing European privacy regulators. In In the case of the French CNIL we have contacted them several times in recent weeks to answer their concerns, but they haven&apos;t come back to us. We&apos;re happy to continue to talk to them and others Damien asks:  How long does our data stay on your system?  Peter Barron answers:     Peter Barron, director of external relations, EMEA, Google    the amount of time information stays on our servers varies depending on the product. If you&apos;re not logged in, we anonymise our logs after 9 months. If you&apos;re logged in--for example in Gmail--we&apos;ll keep that information until you choose to delete it or you close your account. To be clear - we don&apos;t give or sell the data to anyone else Rippilc asks:  why are google trying to ruin the internet by throwing up ads all over the place? And are you worried that people will leave google services and use yahoo or bing and like me pay 69p for my mail and privacy?  Peter Barron answers:     Peter Barron, director of external relations, EMEA, Google    We think that people prefer targeted ads to random ads, because they&apos;re more useful (and as a result people see fewer ads). The ads pay for almost all the services you use and consume online, but with some services, like Spotify, you can of course choose the pay rather than receive ads Kashish asks:  Has Google learnt nothing from the Buzz fiasco? Why then is there no option for users to opt out of its new privacy policy? Logging out of Google services to avoid being tracked is a terrible alternative. And I am not even talking about Android users. After all, the seamless experience while using Google services is one of the USPs of the OS.  Peter Barron answers:     Peter Barron, director of external relations, EMEA, Google    you don&apos;t have to sign out of Google in order to control how we use your data. You can turn off your search history from the Google Dashboard, for example. And none of those control tools are going away today. As for opting out of the privacy policy as a whole: that&apos;s not how privacy policies work. You can&apos;t opt out of the Guardian&apos;s privacy policy, or that of the other services you use. But you have a lot of choice about how your data is used mydogfudge asks:  So thats me moving to firefox as of right now. I hate how internet based services always brand things as these fantastic innovative new changes that help usability etc. when in fact all they want to is know more about you, in order to sell you stuff for their own profit. I have no huge problem with advertising but the surveillance and potential to share that with third parties is very worrying.  Peter Barron answers:      Peter Barron, director of external relations, EMEA, Google    Firefox is a great browser, but I should make clear that our new privacy policy doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;ll be collecting any more information from users. Nor will be be changing anyone&apos;s privacy settings. Thanks for all your comments and questions.",

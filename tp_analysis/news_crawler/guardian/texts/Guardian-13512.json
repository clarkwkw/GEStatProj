But first, they need to make some moulds.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       To get a closer look the group collect samples of bacteria from their faces on slides and stain them, ready to inspect under the microscope.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       With the support of academics, the team experiment with different types of bacteria to make their sculpture.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Guardian       A student drips coloured dye on to a sample of bacteria taken from the face of their colleague, so it can be looked at under the microscope.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Guardian       For this microbiology exercise students make thumbprints in agar, a common medium used for the growth of bacteria.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       In the darkroom a group of students experiment with bio-luminescent bacteria, which glows in the dark when shaken. They hope to produce an interactive light installation for the final show.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Guardian       I try my hand at drawing using bio-luminescent bacteria, producing this abstract-impressionist representation of a cat. Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       In this series of working drawings, an illustration student sketches out his vision for a bio-luminescent light sculpture.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       The illustrations of the bio-luminescent sculpture get worked up in to a more scientific presentation.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       In one session, Broad Vision students are given a selection of materials and are asked to make 'anatomical' sculptures. Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       Some students on Broad Vision play with light and photography. This picture is the result of an exercise to produce images without the use of cameras.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       Not for the faint hearted: Broad Vision students observe an organ dissection in an anatomy session.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       The art of colour: Broad Vision students splash paint on to a blank sheet of paper during a collective drawing exercise.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       The science of colour: in stark contrast to the previous task, Broad Vision students take part in an imaging science exercise exploring how subjective our perception of colour is.Photograph: Broad Vision 2013/Guardian       Art and science students work together in the lab - the expertise of each helps enable the group to achieve what they set out to do.

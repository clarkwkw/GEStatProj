    "text": "You would be forgiven for thinking that shrinking space budgets are a total disaster. Certainly, they&apos;re not good news but the irony is that having less money may force us into missions that might previously have been overlooked, yet still have the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the universe. In March this year, the European Space Agency issued a call for small mission ideas. This is something of a departure for the ESA, which in the past has only used smaller missions to test technology, such as with Smart-1 and Proba. The idea is to produce a credible science mission for launch in 2017 costing the ESA just 50m. Additional funds of up to 100m can be sought from national funding bodies. More than 60 letters of intent were received, a number of them designed to test aspects of gravity that could lead to a fundamental breakthrough in physics. The beauty of gravitational physics missions is that they are generally cheap to build. The spacecraft doesn&apos;t necessarily need to do much, just move as gravity dictates. Earth-bound scientists then track the movement and compare it with theoretical predictions. If they find a discrepancy, they have discovered a clue to physics beyond Einstein, and the game is really on. Hints of unexplainable spacecraft motion have shown up for many years, the most famous being the Pioneer anomaly. Although it may now have been explained as the recoil from heat being released from the spacecraft&apos;s radioactive power source, there is another odd motion stepping into the limelight: the flyby anomaly. Some spacecraft appear to pick up more speed than expected when they fly by Earth to boost their velocity. The amount of extra energy is variable and not every flyby produces this effect. Puzzling. Is it real or just tracking errors? One small mission proposal, by Orfeu Bertolami, of the University of Porto in Portugal, is designed to find out by using a small spacecraft that would constantly determine its position using the ESA&apos;s Galileo satellite navigation system. Another proposal, by Ignazio Ciufolini, of the University of Lecce in Italy, would follow up his Italian mission, the Laser Relativity Satellite (Lares). Launched in February this year, Lares hit headlines as the high-tech disco ball that could dethrone Einstein. It is studying an aspect of general relativity called frame dragging. It cost less than 10m and is expected to produce a measurement within one percentage point of Relativity&apos;s prediction. GalileoGalilei (GG) by Anna Nobili, of the University of Pisa in Italy, would follow up an independent French mission, Microscope (Micro-Satellite  trane Compense pour l&apos;Observation du Principe d&apos;Equivalence), currently being built. Both aim to test the equivalence principle, a cornerstone of general relativity, to increasing sensitivities. The equivalence principle states that masses respond to gravity in the same way they do to other forces. In other words, if I push an object along, it behaves in the same way as when I drop it. But why should that be true? Small deviations from this behaviour are predicted by the string theories of physics, which seek to unite our understanding of gravity with the other forces of nature. Intriguingly, or frustratingly depending upon your outlook, no test has yet found a discrepancy. Either string theories are wrong, or we need to look at gravity in more detail. There are other proposals on the ESA small missions list intended to probe gravity in other ways. Ironically, simple gravitational missions, which have perhaps the greatest chance of creating a scientific revolution, are among the cheapest that can be imagined. Yet neither the ESA nor Nasa has been inclined towards them before. Could budget restrictions on both sides of the Atlantic remedy this? The ESA will evaluate the small mission proposals between July and October and announce which one it will fund. Although there are many excellent other ideas in the letters of intent, from solar storm monitors to searches for habitable planets around other stars, my fingers are crossed for a gravity mission.

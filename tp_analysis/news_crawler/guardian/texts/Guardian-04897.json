    "headline": "Nintendo Switch: can the new console succeed where Wii U failed?", 
    "text": "Nintendos next console looks like it may just be the Nintendo console weve all been waiting for  at least since the Wii U was consigned to being the dustiest thing on our shelves. Eccentric, interesting, boasting widespread industry support and with a focus on portability that plays to Nintendos considerable strengths (Game Boy, DS, 3DS ...), the Switch is the veteran companys attempt to reinvent gaming. Again. Some of the biggest reveals from the Nintendo Direct broadcast included: the re-introduction of cartridge games, similar to those used in the 3DS; the fact that Bethesdas Skyrim remaster will be coming to the system, which is huge; and the removable side controls that can be slotted into a larger controller or used on their own as tiny little handheld gadgets that look like they may well cramp up podgier fingers in a few short minutes. Theyre called Joy-Cons, a controversial naming decision which reminds some of the old Namco Jogcon pads and others of a euphemism for injuring yourself during sex.     Nintendo Switch console Photograph: Nintendo    While Wii U drew a handful of third-party triple A titles  including Watch Dogs and Assassins Creed III  due to the machines limited processing power compared to the Xbox One and the PS4, those games were delayed, scaled down or just forgotten about, as fans opted for the consoles that have been home to those games for years. Now, however, were seeing Skyrim on a Nintendo console. This would have been almost unimaginable five years ago. Its hard to decide what the most important part of this is: Nintendo branching out into huge third-party franchises? Bethesda reaching out to Nintendo, forming what could be a lucrative future partnership? The graphical capability on the Switch finally matching Sony and Microsofts consoles? Being able to play Skyrim on the go? Seeing Nintendo finally realise how to market itself in a smart way? Or, perhaps, its all of the above. Whatever, its an incredibly exciting time to be a Nintendo fan. The Switch trailer focused on the consoles portability above all, showcasing the different combinations of controller. There are the Joy-Cons, then the Joy-Con Grip, which turns two controllers into a larger more conventional pad, (that also somewhat resembles a goofy dog), and most importantly, the screen-plus-Joy-Cons format that allows for ultimate portability.    I think Nintendo Switch&#39;s nickname must be &quot;Crazy Dog&quot; :D pic.twitter.com/7KGLS0wyql&mdash;  Prof.Sakamoto (@pskmt) October 20, 2016    Some are already worried that the constant swapping and changing of the consoles detachable bits might lead to breakages, and though Nintendo consoles have never been as low-quality as, say, the DualShock 4s disintegrating analogue pads, its a valid concern.    Tiny ass Nintendo Switch controllers...might be a prob. Also hope Nintendo did durability testing with all that swapping&mdash; Raymond Wong  (@raywongy) October 20, 2016    The trailer also showed the wide variety of locations you will be able to play in, suggesting that the Switch-screen-plus-Joy-Cons can be used without mains power or the internet. There were games being played in a park, on a plane, in the toilet  all very important locations. Theres no price point on the Switch yet, but given Nintendos history with hardware launches (it has often cut back on costs by using cheaper components and materials than its competitors), its likely to come in at around the 300 mark. The processor is a custom version of Nvidias Tegra processor, usually found in smartphones and tablets. Its not as powerful as the Xbox One or PS4, but Nintendos priorities have never been geared towards graphical capabilities, concentrating instead on form-factor, and innovative interfaces  the Wii Remote being the classic example. On the negative side: custom-built hardware is a pain for developers to master and support: this may limit the machines role in major multi-platform release schedules and could also put many smaller studios off.     Who else is excited about developing for a low resolution Tegra tablet with stick on controls and physical media? Hell yeah!&mdash; Ben Cousins (@BenjaminCousins) October 20, 2016    However, the fact that this is a custom-built version of the Tegra means its at least optimised for this new machine, meaning  in theory  that developers will be able to garner greater performance from the chipset more easily. More importantly, using smartphone/tablet-orientated tech should mean increased battery life. The tricky thing, and the thing we dont know much about yet, is whether the Switch will have a strong enough launch lineup of games. This was one of the aspects that let the Wii U down  although games like Zombi U and Nintendoland were excellent, they werent enough to drive consumers to the shops.

Photograph: Nintendo    However, after the Wii Us weak launch, its looking likely that Nintendo will bolster the launch of the Switch with two of its largest franchises, Zelda and Mario, and those are two games weve already seen glimpses of in the trailer. The next Zelda, as we already know, is Breath of the Wild  which seems like an attempt at courting and combining the communities behind Monster Hunter, Skyrim and the survival game genre. The new 3D Mario is more of an unknown quantity, given the scant few seconds of footage teased in the trailer, but it looks like no Mario game weve seen before. It has the glorious lighting and vivid colours of Mario Kart 8 and the more recent Color Splash, and the 3D platforming open-world look of Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 3D World. Some have even pointed out that there are rings. Now, where have we seen rings before ?    Two things about that snippet of Mario Switch footage:1. Triple-jump is back!2. Rings. Sonic-like rings, in fact.&mdash; Chris Schilling (@schillingc) October 20, 2016    How will the new console fare for indies, though? Nintendo is notably lacklustre at supporting the independent game scene, whereas Sony and Microsoft both have initiatives to do so. Though it looks like the hardware will be off-putting to many, some smaller studios  mostly those that Nintendo has worked with in the past  are stepping up to the challenge. Image &amp; Form  the developer behind the incredible Steamworld Dig and Steamworld Heist  is on that list.             Despite patchy support, the Wii U did host an array of exciting indie titles that could have been hits had they enjoyed a larger install base to market to. Games like Teslagrad, Scram Kitty, Affordable Space Adventures and Swords &amp; Soldiers II were all very strong, and deserved greater acknowledgement than they received. Perhaps the Switch will be a more stable home. Nintendos focus, though, seems to be on the market that spans handheld and home consoles, and games like Skyrim and Breath of the Wild that have the space (and the budget) to stretch out far and wide. From the trailer, it looks like the target demographic is 20-somethings with unreasonably large living rooms and a desire to take their games on the go.     Nintendo has learned from the mistakes of the disastrous Wii U, with a GamePad that promised a degree of portable gaming, but the unit relied on its proximity to the host machine. Photograph: Yuya Shino/Reuters    Its an interesting move for a company that so often tries to play on the nostalgia of its older fans  but Nintendo has been attempting to break into that younger market for a while, with their varying levels of success in mobile games and toys-to-life. Theres a lot we dont know about the Switch just yet  but it does look like Nintendo has learned from the mistakes of the rather disastrous Wii U. That machines GamePad promised a degree of portable gaming, but the unit relied on its proximity to the host machine. Switch offers the freedom of a contained handheld unit with the performance and living room appeal of a console. It will be interesting to see if it will have the array of streaming video apps that weve become accustomed to from modern machines. We also dont know if its a touchscreen or not.  Nintendo says it will reveal more information before the March launch. After the indifference that has haunted the Wii U, the fact that the Switch generated as much hype and interest as the Red Dead Redemption 2 trailer suggests that this is a whole different proposition. Right now, the important thing isnt that there are questions to be answered, its that people want to ask them. ",

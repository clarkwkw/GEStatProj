    "text": "A fortnight into 2013 and we&apos;re already starting to worry about the number of students who will be enrolling on to courses this year.  January is a big month  tomorrow (15 January) is the main deadline for applications through UCAS, whose latest set of stats showed a 5.6% fall in the number of applications already made compared to last year. Around the same time we&apos;re expecting Hefce to publish provisional details of each institution&apos;s allocated number of student places for 2013 entry, accounting for this year&apos;s unrestricted ABB+ recruitment. At the end of the month we&apos;re likely to be in a position with fewer applicants, less restriction on offering places to high grade students and more restrictions on offering places to other applicants. There are many issues that the higher education sector is waiting to see settled but one thing is certain: this summer will see strong competition to convert offers into acceptances, with the implication that some institutions will expand their ABB cohort as others undershoot their overall recruitment targets. So what will influence the decisions of applicants? I think there are two main factors, the first of which is fairly obvious: facts about the institution and quality indicators. Universities minister David Willetts last week claimed that the launch of Key Information Sets (KIS) was the reform he is proudest off. It is certainly true that the publication of KIS data offers prospective students a great deal of transparency to aid their choices. However, there are question marks over how reflective simple numbers are of the quality of particular courses. A low number of contact hours may not reflect the nature of a subject that demands long periods of independent learning. Similarly, the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) which is featured in the KIS presents a flawed picture of long term career prospects. The challenge for institutions is to provide and promote information on the particular context of their courses to complement the raw data presented in the KIS. The qualities of an institution include much more than simple information about courses though, so institutions need to work hard to paint a picture of what life will be like as a member of their student body. The tried and tested methods of prospectuses and open days should play a part, but so too should innovative ideas like experiential recruitment. The second factor I think will influence the behaviour of applicants is the reputation each institution carries. Potential students will be attracted to joining a particular community, held in a popular esteem they would be proud to be associated with. The challenge facing each institution is to make sure that their reputations are more powerful than flawed generic hooks like &apos;Russell Group&apos; or &apos;former-poly&apos;. Every aspect of a university, even those with seemingly little relevance to undergraduates, should be marshalled towards the definition of its identity. The amount and type of research carried out; the partnerships held with businesses; the geography of the international links that have been developed; and the diversity of the academic community are just a few of the building blocks that must be used to construct a distinctively good reputation. Nothing should be ignored in promoting an idea of the nature of an institution, and why applicants should want to be a part of it. The race is on to attract the cream of the 2013 applicants. The first institutions across the finish line will be those that best promote the qualities of their courses and have a strong grip on the way in which they are more widely perceived.

    "text": "September started with a brief spell of summer-time smog. Ground level ozone reached &quot;moderate&quot;, according to the UK pollution index, along the south coast on the 7th and 8th and then spread north as far as Blackpool, Sunderland, and the Edinburgh suburbs on the 9th. This was the day of the Paralympic marathon: fortunately the races were completed before pollution peaked in central London during the mid-afternoon. The successes of British cyclists have inspired us to get on our bikes leading to increased cycle sales and a surge in the use of London&apos;s Boris bikes this summer  up over 50% compared to last year. Every urban cyclist is keenly aware of air pollution; they travel among the traffic close to vehicle exhaust. This proximity coupled with fast breathing rates leads to increased pollution dose. So is cycling bad for our health? Scientists in Barcelona looked at the health impact of that city&apos;s cycle hire scheme, regularly used by 28,000 cyclists. They found that for each additional cyclist death caused by the extra air pollution exposure and road accidents, 77 deaths per year would be avoided due to the benefits from increased exercise. A recent UK study has suggested that the NHS might benefit from savings of 17bn in 20 years&apos; time if we increased urban walking and cycling to the current levels of Copenhagen; benefits from fewer heart attacks, strokes and less diabetes could be achieved within three years.",

    "text": "The name &quot;Walter&apos;s Wood&quot; has not yet made it on to the Ordnance Survey map, but this small piece of woodland has been here for centuries, hiding in a beautiful corner of Dorset. Looking north, with your back to the sea, is a view of the most southerly chalk hills on mainland Britain. Walter Tait knew nothing about the purchase of the woods: he was just a baby when his mum and dad bought them on his behalf and named them after him. Now that he is eight, he is starting to appreciate their value  not least when it comes to playground bragging rights. &quot;Saying you own a wood is much better than saying you own a toy or a go-kart,&quot; says his father, Nick, 47, who has built a sturdy treehouse in the middle of the plot, where Walter and his mates play and camp out. Not long after they moved to their current house, Nick, a translator, and his wife, Debbie, 46, a law lecturer, began the hunt for some woodland. &quot;I went round all the local villages dropping notes through landowners&apos; letterboxes, asking if anyone had any woodland for sale,&quot; says Nick. &quot;But all the land round here seemed to be covenanted. Finally I heard back from a farmer from a very old Dorset family who was willing to sell three acres just half a mile from our house. I bought it for a few thousand pounds.     We're going to have to turn from being an ash wood to a mixed wood: Debbie, Nick and eight-year-old Walter in Walter's Wood, Dorset Photograph: Harry Borden    &quot;I wanted to invest in something for the future for Walter and to offset carbon from travelling,&quot; says Nick, who went on a six-month forestry course to learn how to manage the ash trees that grow on two of the three acres. The remaining acre is a meadow of wild flowers and shrubs  bluebells, spindles, wayfarers  at the top of which are seven oaks planted by Nick and a bench of Purbeck stone that he had made and inscribed: &quot;We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree&quot; The arrival in the UK of the deadly ash dieback has given these words a hollow ring; Nick is already planning for a future without ash. &quot;We&apos;re going to have to turn from being an ash wood to a mixed wood,&quot; he says. &quot;This winter I&apos;m going to start transplanting hazel and oak among the existing trees. Everyone is so gloomy about the prospects for ash that we have to assume the worst. It will be next summer until we can tell whether our trees are affected.&quot; Should the ash survive, Nick aims to coppice the trees every seven years  the wood is used to make tool handles, furniture, walking sticks, tent pegs and wheel rims. &quot;I like the simplicity of the process of growing and coppicing trees. It&apos;s like riding a bike rather than driving a car,&quot; says Nick, who works in the wood during winter and in the neighbouring allotment in summer. Debbie, meanwhile, is working on a family history. &quot;My family has lived in this part of England for at least 500 to 600 years,&quot; she says. &quot;But no one has ever owned land. Until now.&quot; John NottCornwall     I can't remember how much I paid for it: Sir John Nott, former defence secretary in his woods in Cornwall.  Photograph: Harry Borden    Former defence secretary Sir John Nott is fighting a rearguard action  against grey squirrels. &quot;They&apos;re an absolute nightmare,&quot; says the man who was charged with defending Britain during the Falklands war. &quot;They bite around the bark of trees and kill them.&quot; A member of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, John would love to see grey squirrels eliminated to enable their red cousins to thrive throughout the country  and in his wood in particular. John&apos;s wood, which is in a different part of the county from his farm near St Erth in west Cornwall, is a 50-acre haven, much of which has lain unmanaged for centuries. Forty years ago, John bought the shooting and fishing rights  a river runs nearby  from John Foot, brother of former Labour leader Michael, before going on to buy the wood outright from a farmer. &quot;I really can&apos;t remember how much I paid,&quot; he says. When we visited, the squirrels were keeping a low profile, although there was evidence of their tree-gnawing. There were plenty of pheasants  unsurprisingly, given the many grain feeders  and wrens, which flew about issuing &quot;churr-churrs&quot; of warning. Venerable oaks with trunks covered in moss stretch out their crooked limbs like an illustration from Grimms&apos; Fairy Tales. &quot;We really should have thinned some of it,&quot; says John, who planted 500 sweet chestnut trees 30 years ago and has added more recently. &quot;Not all the saplings have survived,&quot; he adds. &quot;The roe deer come and bite the heads off.&quot; Aside from shooting once a year, John, 80, spends his time in the wood &quot;walking around, muttering against the squirrels, muttering against the deer&quot;. He is proud to keep the wood &quot;totally non-commercial, a conservation project&quot;, and is unapologetic about his desire for the land to remain private: &quot;I love this wood  and I don&apos;t want anyone else to come in. I want to keep it in the family, pass it on to my son and my grandson. &quot;Woods are beautiful things and I&apos;m a bit greedy about mine. A very nice lady from the Woodland Trust came and asked if I would like to grant public access. But if people start going through, it will damage the wildlife. I want to keep it wild and as nature intended.&quot; &quot;Few woods remain in this country that are wild,&quot; chimes in his wife, Miloshka, 77. &quot;We must preserve what we have.&quot; Virginia ArnottDevon     Virginia Arnott. Photograph: Louise Crook    &quot;Hello. I am the wild woman from the woods.&quot; That is how Virginia Arnott introduced herself to the inhabitants of the few isolated cottages that border her wood when she bought it two years ago. In one sense, she is right: for up to 42 nights a year  the maximum she is permitted by law  Virginia leaves her Oxfordshire home and comes down to this secluded, tranquil spot in north Devon to live, wild, in the woods. But in many ways the sylvan life she leads is anything but wild: she has created an enclave of civilisation among the pine and ash trees that make up most of her five-acre domain. Tonight, on the open fire, she is cooking lamb chops, sausages and corn on the cob, with homemade bread, and baked apples to follow. Last night it was monkfish tails with ahollandaise sauce. Virginia fetches water from the swollen stream at the bottom of her plot. She prepares the food beneath an awning of wood and canvas, where cooking utensils hang from the walls. After supper, she will retire to the hut that she and a female friend erected. There she will play the flute or read by the light of a gas lamp. Then she will half-fill alaundry basket with water that has been warming on the fire and take a bath in the open air, with the scuttling of mice and the hooting of owls for company. She will visit the composting loo. And then she will go to sleep in her tent. &quot;I bought the wood after my husband died,&quot; says Virginia, who is in her 50s and works as an occupational therapist. &quot;It would not have suited us as a married couple. This was something I wanted to do for me.&quot; A farmer sold a section of woodland to Woodlands.co.uk, a company that sells and provides advice on small woods, which divided it into five parcels, one of which Virginia bought for &quot;some tens of thousands of pounds&quot;. &quot;I hadn&apos;t planned to spend that much,&quot; she says, &quot;but I had seen eight other pieces of land and this one was just right: a stream, a level area for camping, beautiful light. Gorgeous. &quot;I wanted somewhere that I could go to and get away from it all. I also wanted a place where my grandchildren could go native  dam up the stream, pick blackberries, build dens. Igrew up in South Africa and we spent holidays with my granny. I would feed the cows, stack up peanuts, stand above the dam and have pissing competitions with the boys. Iwant my grandchildren to have that.&quot; There are no grandchildren yet but Arnott&apos;s children, Ashleigh, 25, and Christopher, 23, regularly come down to Devon with their mates. Arnott sometimes invites friends to join her: an extra pair of hands is helpful for transporting heavier items such as tools, or bags of straw to act as carpet, from the car down the steep half-mile track that leads to the woods. And friends may come in handy if Chalara fraxinea spores reach her ash trees. Arnott plans to inspect them in the spring for signs of the fungus and may have to resort to felling them. Few people have the inclination or the courage to do what Arnott does; fewer still are women. Yet woods hold no fear for her; they are her companion. Sitting in the neighbouring field with a beer in hand, the cows grazing around and the sun setting behind the trees, you can understand why. David Brudenell-BruceWiltshire     We get all sorts here: David Brudenell-Bruce with his dog Lucy. Photograph: Harry Borden    Do not be alarmed if you are walking in Savernake Forest and you spy a bevy of suspicious-looking middle-aged men hiding behind trees. The chances are they are income tax inspectors honing their surveillance skills. &quot;We get all sorts here,&quot; says David Brudenell-Bruce, the Earl of Cardigan. &quot;The army, butterfly collectors, the odd rave. On average, we get 250,000 visitors a year. I don&apos;t mind people coming in as long as they don&apos;t abuse the forest.&quot; David, 59, is the hereditary warden of Savernake: the forest has been in his family since the autumn of 1067, passing down from father to son (and, on three occasions, daughter) for 31 generations. David and his American second wife, Joanne, 48, live in a lodge in aclearing in the middle of the forest. History is in the air. It was to Savernake that Henry VIII came to hunt and it was here, in Wolf Hall on the edge of the forest, that he met Jane Seymour; their son went on to become Edward VI of England and Ireland. Not all David&apos;s forebears were so illustrious: in the late-19th century, an ancestor gambled the family fortune away on horses, nearly losing the forest in the process. Two trustees were appointed to prevent similar profligacy in the future. But the trustees bring a separate set of problems: David believes the incumbents do not have the estate&apos;s best interests at heart and is engaged in a legal battle to have them removed: &quot;I will never rest until I have got rid of them,&quot; he says. A court case is due this winter. At 4,500 acres  a 10th of its size in its heyday  Savernake is the only privately owned forest in Britain; the Grand Avenue, which runs four miles straight through the middle, is the longest avenue in Britain. The wooded area is let out to the Forestry Commission; the estate derives its income from the rent from 20 properties, which range in size from cottages to the vast, mainly 19th-century, grade I-listed Tottenham House, which David hopes to lease out as a luxury hotel; one such deal fell through last year. &quot;The future of the forest is bound up with Tottenham House,&quot; says David. &quot;If I can let it, the rent will safeguard Savernake.&quot; David&apos;s son, Viscount Thomas Savernake, 30, will inherit the forest. &quot;He has shown little interest in it so far,&quot; says David. &quot;But Ihope he&apos;ll come round to the idea. He doesn&apos;t live in the forest, but he knows that there will always be accommodation for him here in Savernake. Mind you, he may have to wait until he&apos;s 50 before he inherits. It&apos;s an enormous responsibility looking after the forest, but Iwas born to do nothing else. This is what Iwas put on earth to do.&quot; Kevin and Claire BirdWales     Matthew, Kevin and Claire Bird in their geodesic dome. Photograph: Harry Borden    An adder is curled up in the long grass, impervious to the two people admiring it from above. &quot;This is where the ninth green was,&quot; says Kevin Bird. &quot;Not that you&apos;d know to look at it now.&quot; You can just about imagine golfers putting here, in the middle of this 60-acre wood on the west coast of Wales from where you can see the ferry coming in and out of Fishguard. It was 22 years ago that a farmer bought the course and planted it with Sitka spruce, larch and ash. The trees that are already here and thosethatthey intend to plant are what interest Kevin, 47, and his wife Claire, 50, whopaid 2,200 an acre when they bought the wood from the farmer. The Birds, who have ason, Matthew, 16, own a campsite, Trellyn, sixmiles from the wood, that runs entirely ontimber. &quot;All our yurts have woodburning stoves, every tent pitch has a camp fire, we have awoodburning sauna and a woodburning bread oven and we heat our house entirely with wood. We get through 32 tonnes a year,&quot; says Kevin. &quot;We needed the new land to become self-sufficient in wood.&quot; The couple grew to love the area after going there on holiday from their home in Gloucestershire. Twenty years ago they moved to Wales for good, Kevin to work for an exhibition and graphics firm and Claire to manage alarge vets&apos; practice. The campsite, itself in 16 acres of woodland, &quot;just evolved&quot;, says Kevin. &quot;Trees grew up around the house and we thought: campsite.&quot; The new wood is not just a purveyor of timber, however. The Birds plan to turn it into &quot;an ecological and community resource&quot;. They will open it to parties from the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme, to bushcraft courses  &quot;We want to share our backyard with like-minded people&quot;  and are aiming to keep areas wild to encourage native flora and fauna such as red kites, lizards, adders  of which there is already no shortage  and hares. &quot;We want to make everything very sustainable,&quot; says Kevin. &quot;I had a dream in my teens that I would live near the sea and have a bit of land. I love the feeling of space. But you can never feel that you really own the wood. We are just the custodians for now.&quot;",

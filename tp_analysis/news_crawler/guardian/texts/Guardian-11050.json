    "text": "A sharp increase in student visas popular with English language learners coming to the UK to study has raised concern that bogus applicants could be abusing the visa system to enter the country. The latest official statistics on migration to the UK show a sharp rise in the number of student visitor visas (SVV), which allow entry for up to 11 months but which are easier to obtain than the long-term student visa, known as Tier 4. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) report on migration figures published last month revealed that applications for SVVs rose by 12% to a record 67,000 in the 12-month period ending in September 2012. In contrast Tier 4 visas issued in the same period dropped by 26% to 211,000. Education providers in the UK say that fall is a result of tighter rules for Tier 4 applicants introduced by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) over recent years. But a separate report by John Vine, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, into the management of student visas by UKBA  published in the same week as the ONS statistics  calls on the government agency to monitor SVV numbers for possible abuse. The report highlights a significant change in student visa trends. Between February and May 2012 for the first time more SVVs were issued than Tier 4 visas. The report says this change was a result of a sharp fall in Tier 4 applications possibly linked to the introduction of further visa rule changes. But the trend in SVV applications is also increasing year on year Vine observed. &quot;The number of SVV applications was on average 28% higher between January and June 2012 than during the same period in 2011,&quot; he stated. Vine&apos;s report warned: &quot;We found a potential risk of non-genuine students opting to apply for SVVs instead of Tier 4. SVVs are not subject to the same stringent rules that are applied to Tier 4. The UKBA needs to be alert to this to ensure that this route is not exploited in the future.&quot; English language schools and colleges in the UK which are the destination for most SVV holders, and which rely on SVVs for a significant part of their revenue, now fear that their business will suffer if UKBA tightens SVV rules. Tony Millns, the chief executive of English UK, the industry body which represents English language providers, says the rise in SVVs should be seen as an endorsement of the UK&apos;s English language teaching expertise and not as a threat. &quot;I would of course argue that there is no reason why an increase in student visitors should be regarded as a bad thing. English UK is aware however that some independent tertiary colleges are making more use of the SVV route for courses for which it probably is not appropriate, and this may be an area which the UKBA should monitor,&quot; Millns said. The standard SVV is intended for adults who want to enrol on a short course in the UK and is valid for six months. But in 2010 English UK lobbied UKBA to extend the period that SVV holders could stay in the country. English UK argued that learners of English needed more time to reach a higher minimum English proficiency, which was introduced for Tier 4 applicants in 2010. In January 2011 UKBA introduced a special 11-month &quot;extended&quot; SVV specifically for students enrolling at English language schools and colleges. The latest ONS figures do not differentiate between six- and 11-month SVVs but Millns points out that the sharp fall in the number of Tier 4 students enrolled at English language schools  a drop of 76% in the past year  supports English UK&apos;s argument that genuine English language learners are switching to the extended SVVs. Earlier this year English UK appealed to immigration ministers to make the extended SVV a permanent part of visa rules. A survey of member schools and colleges with students enrolled on the extended visas showed that applicants for the visa were less likely to have their application turned down by UKBA staff. It also indicated that SVV holders had a high rate or return at the end of their period of study and more than 80% of student reached the level in English required for long-term study, English UK claimed. In a letter to immigration minister Damian Green, Millns wrote: &quot;The average length of course the extended SVV students attended was 32 weeks, pretty much as envisaged in the reasoning for its introduction. Around 85% of students reached level B1 in English by the end of their course, again suggesting that this visa is doing what was expected in its conception.&quot;",

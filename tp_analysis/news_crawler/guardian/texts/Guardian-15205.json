    "text": "The International Labour Organisation&apos;s latest Global Employment Trends for Youth report makes tragic reading: an estimated 73.4 million young people are expected to be unemployed around the world in 2013, and the picture is set to get only worse. We believe that if we abandon young people on the cusp of adulthood it could lead to a generation permanently scarred in terms of future employability and earnings, with wide ripple effects for families and communities. Our global partnership with Barclays is striving to reach these young people. We use the best of both our experience, combining Barclays financial and business expertise with Unicef&apos;s local knowledge, to work with young people in communities of high unemployment in developing countries. We provide in-depth training, encouraging entrepreneurship along with mentoring and access to work placements that give young people the skills they need. We know this approach works. Nanda Khadke, 24, from India, one of the many young people we have helped, says: &quot;I now have the confidence to tackle any aspect of life. I am a young entrepreneur and I&apos;m determined to do a lot more.&quot; We must invest more attention, resources and effort today in our young people, with projects such as this, or suffer tomorrow the social and economic consequences of a generation excluded from the opportunity to fulfil their huge potential.David BullExecutive director, Unicef UK",

    "text": "An important step has been taken this week towards making employers pay their interns, but to see real change interns themselves must take part in the debate. On Wednesday, the Labour MP Hazel Blears won a vote to bring forward a bill to outlaw the advertisement of unpaid internships. Under minimum wage legislation, everyone who works, including interns, are entitled to the national rate, currently 6.19 an hour for those aged 21 and over. But unpaid internships are still endemic in many industries. &quot;The government is failing to enforce the national minimum wage,&quot; says Gus Baker, co-founder of Intern Aware, the campaign for fairer internships. &quot;This bill not only raises the profile of the issue, but would give the government the power to prosecute companies who advertise illegal unpaid internships.&quot; Government support is essential in bringing an end to the epidemic of unpaid working, but interns have a role to play too. It has taken me four years, seven internships and three years of a degree to realise that I deserve to be paid for my time, and that I should not be afraid to say so. On Wednesday I went to parliament to hear Blears talk about the bill and to share my own experiences of unpaid internships. People from richer backgrounds are three times more likely to have undertaken unpaid internships than those from poorer backgrounds, according to a recent survey conducted by NUS and YouGov. I have managed to support myself with my student loan while working for free, but when I graduate, unpaid work will no longer be an option. Yet I am constantly being told that I should expect to work for free after graduating. After my seventh internship, I decided enough was enough. I have become actively involved in the campaign against unpaid internships, both at my university and nationally. I have protested outside a famous PR company, and I gave official evidence to the Low Pay Commission, which is currently investigating unpaid internships. When I talk to students about unpaid internships, one common response is: &quot;But I don&apos;t mind working for free.&quot; What I hear is: &quot;I can afford to work for free.&quot; My involvement in the campaign has made me much more conscious of my individual responsibility. If I were to take on unpaid work now, I would be very aware that, by doing so, I am not just saying that I don&apos;t deserve a wage, but that my peers and friends don&apos;t either. For every person who can work for free, there are so many who simply cannot afford to. This means that they are being shut out of many careers where internships are an essential part of your CV. The work of unpaid interns underpins many industries. &quot;Our poll found that as many as 20% of young people have done an unpaid internship, which suggests that this is being used ever increasingly as a cost-cutting exercise by businesses,&quot; says NUS vice-president Dannielle Grufferty. &quot;Fundamentally, we need to stop the practise of unpaid internships, and stand up for all those who feel forced to work for free, as well as those who are not able do so.&quot; A big step for me was finding the confidence to value myself enough to warrant a wage. Although we all feel grateful for experiences gained within companies, we shouldn&apos;t underestimate the work we do there, or what we have to offer. &quot;Unpaid internships are a modern-day scandal. They allow unscrupulous employers to exploit the hopes and dreams of young people desperate to get a foothold on the career ladder,&quot; said Blears after yesterday&apos;s vote. &quot;The only people who can afford to work for free are those with money behind them, or who live in London. It is a nonsense that it&apos;s still lawful to advertise unpaid internships, which are unlawful under national minimum wage legislation. It is time we put an end to this practise, and today was an important first step in our campaign to end the culture of unpaid internships for good.&quot; Students and graduates need to stand firm on this issue. We may not have the benefit of paid employment, but we do have voices, and we should be using them.     Guardian students sign up banner  ",

    "text": "African leaders travel to Addis Ababa this week to celebrate 50 years of the African Union. The AU website promises the anniversary will  facilitate and celebrate African narratives of past, present and future that will enthuse and energise the African population and use their constructive energy to accelerate a forward looking agenda of pan-Africanism and renaissance.  We want to hear your thoughts on the milestone. Is 50 years of the AU a cause for celebration? What will shape the continent over the next 50 years? Since its inception as the Organisation of African Unity in 1963, the union has helped to mobilise opinion against colonialism, and resolve conflicts and disputes in the continent, but challenges lie ahead. The AU relies heavily on external sources for funding, raising concerns about autonomy and African ownership, and there are questions about its leadership. Is Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja right when he argues on the Poverty matters blog that the concentration of authoritarian rulers in member states means the &quot;AU is ill-equipped to meet people&apos;s aspirations for democracy and social progress&quot;? The funding outlook has changed significantly over the past half-century and will affect development efforts. The African diaspora send more money home to their families than overseas development assistance from western aid donors. China has emerged as a key donor, spending billions in Africa. There&apos;s increasing recognition that tax revenues are critical to allowing countries to become independent from aid. What about the next 50 years? Six of the top 10 fastest growing economies are in sub-Sarahan Africa (pdf), but the poorest members of society are not always benefiting from rapid economic transformation. Africa is home to 200 million people between the age of 15 and 24, and according to last year&apos;s  African Economic Outlook (pdf) this figure is set to double by 2045. Is the continent sitting on a ticking time bomb of youth unemployment? And what about pan-Africanism? What does pan-Africanism mean in 2013? Will it survive until 2063? Born out of the anti-slavery movement, pan-Africanism has evolved into a social and cultural philosophy that encourages the solidarity of Africans worldwide. What does it mean to you? Africa&apos;s population is more than 1 billion. Does this make pan-Africanism more important than ever? Or an unrealistic dream? The movement encourages members of the African diaspora to be culturally and historically aware of their origins. But, if you have never lived on the continent, how can you do that effectively? Is it down to parents to teach their children an African language and about culture? Should schools offer a broader curriculum, including African language, music, art and history? Should the AU do more to encourage members of the diaspora to &quot;return home&quot;? And if so, can member states make it easier for people of African descent to visit, immigrate or set up businesses?

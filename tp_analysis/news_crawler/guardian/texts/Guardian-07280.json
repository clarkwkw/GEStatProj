    "text": "Sales of alternative and more sustainable species of fish have risen sharply over the past year, UK supermarkets reported on Wednesday. Following a year of high-profile awareness campaigns to encourage take-up of sustainable fish, Sainsbury&apos;s has seen a surge of as much as 117% in sales of lesser-known fish species across the UK this year compared to 2011. It says sales of seabass are up by 57%, fresh pollack by 15%, trout by 29% and tilapia by a significant 117%. M&amp;S is also reporting higher than expected sales of two new lines  hake and pangasius  which it is now planning to introduce in more stores. The supermarket, which has also recently put south coast dab on its shelves, says its hake is sourced from an Marine Stewardship Council-approved fishery in South Africa, while the pangasius is &apos;responsibly farmed&apos; in freshwater ponds in Vietnam. Tesco has singled out the success of pouting, which is related to cod but relatively unknown, where sales have leaped by a staggering 273%. Other significant sales increases for fish caught from sustainable sources have been dab (up 120%), gurnard (up 100%) and whole sea bream (up 50%). Morrisons has also reported strong sales of fish sourced from Cornwall and Devon, including John Dory, red gurnard and dab. Last year the cook and Guardian writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall led the Fish Fight campaign backed by chefs such as Jamie Oliver, which aimed to encourage consumers to reduce over-fishing by switching to less popular but sustainable fish. M&amp;S fish buyer, Chloe Gray, said: &quot;It&apos;s great to see our customers are venturing away from their usual fish suppers and trying something new. Perhaps it&apos;s the &apos;Hugh&apos; effect which is encouraging them to experiment with lesser known species.&quot; A new Sainsburys report published on Thursday found that 51% of its shoppers said health concerns had encouraged them to eat more fish over the last year. However the report also identified some of the key barriers to current fish consumption levels in the UK, including a lack of recipe knowledge (35%), lack of availability of fresh fish in local shops (28%) and shortage of time to prepare fish from scratch (28%).",

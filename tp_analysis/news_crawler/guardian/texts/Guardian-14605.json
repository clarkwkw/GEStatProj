    "text": "As darkness set in last night the rain came, and at times the fall was heavy. I was out early this morning, and it was a cheerless outlook. The showers were heavy, but the air was warm and still, and I ventured to predict a fine day. This it has proved, as between seven and eight o&apos;clock the clouds began to lift, the sun soon broke through the haze, and we then realised the marvellous effect of the warm humid atmosphere on all vegetation. The beds were blue with forget-me-nots and such a show of spring flowers as one had scarcely a hope of seeing for three weeks to come. The bright green leaves on the pear trees seem to have unfolded during the night to a dense mass of foliage, and the blossom on many of the trees is in perfection. The humble bees are busy early and late  insects and birds seem, like the vegetation, to be having a wonderful time. If we have a further spell of this genial weather the countryside will be at its best when our holiday comes, though Whit-week is exceptionally early this year.  Still, week after week the ablest of our young farmers and labourers are leaving the agricultural districts of the North for our colonies or, in many cases, for the United States. But I am glad to say that in a few cases this spring north-country farmers have secured fine farms in the South of England, where both rent and terms of holding were satisfactory, and in two cases farms have been purchased at what I consider really a cheaper price than is asked for many Canadian lands.

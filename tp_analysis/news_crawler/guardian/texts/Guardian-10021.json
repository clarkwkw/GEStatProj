Click here to view  Mankind&apos;s unlikely, hoodie-wearing saviour, Desmond Miles, continues to explore his ancestral memories, this time participating in the American revolution. That means hobnobbing with Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin and chums while defending Native American rights and bumping off Templars and redcoats. Several times the size of past instalments and with a far deeper plot, its characters are ruthless and believable, inhabiting a land in a state of lawless flux. Its countless joyous diversions from a round of Nine Men&apos;s Morris to missions in New York skyscrapers round out an epic of a game. Ubisoft, 29.99-39.99 ",

    "text": "   Kate Raworth, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    I wasn&apos;t in Rio in 1992  I was at university studying economics, having a very narrow model of the world quietly inserted into the back of my head, along with the majority of economists who influence policymaking today. Twenty years on, mainstream economics still treats the environment as an externality, instead of starting from the fact that natural resources are the fundamental wealth on which human life  and even economies  depend. At Oxfam I&apos;ve been working on a way of rethinking the aims of economic development from scratch. It starts with the powerful concept of &quot;nine planetary boundaries&quot;, which highlights that there are global limits to natural resource use, if we are to avoid unacceptable environmental degradation such as climate change and ocean acidification. To that I&apos;ve added the concept of social boundaries, which highlights that every person has a claim on natural resource use, in order to avoid unacceptable deprivations such as hunger, income poverty, and energy poverty. Between social boundaries and planetary boundaries is the safe and just space for humanity to thrive in: a space where every person has the resources needed to lead a dignified and fulfilling life, but where humanity collectively achieves this within the means of what our one planet can provide. And it&apos;s a space shaped like a doughnut  a comic metaphor with a serious message. The central economic project of the 21st century must surely be to devise markets, policies, and indicators that help bring humanity into this safe and just space. So if Rio+20 can help to change the picture of the world that economists carry around in their heads, and if it can point us towards the doughnut, it will have served us well.",

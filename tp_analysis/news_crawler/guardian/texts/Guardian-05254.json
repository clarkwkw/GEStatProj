Look for code linking to a script from rr.nu. Samsung Galaxy S2 to get Ice Cream Sandwich on 15 March &gt;&gt; CNET UK  Ice Cream Sandwich is coming to the Samsung Galaxy S2 this month. It may be later than hoped, but it seems the S2 will update to the latest version of Android on 15 March. That&apos;s according to a post on Samsung&apos;s official Facebook page in Israel -- which has since been deleted. Fingers crossed, folks...   We&apos;ll be interested to hear from people whose device does get updated from 2.x to 4.x about how they like the change. It can jar at first. An electrostatic haptic display for the visually impaired &gt;&gt; National Science Foundation  This project uses electrostatic stimulation of the fingertips (static cling) to display computer graphics to the exploring fingertips. The tactile patterns are felt as a variable sensation of texture or vibration.   Fascinating. But what sort of mad fool would think that Apple would include something like this in the iPad? Oh, hang on. Google Play: The new name for Android Market &gt;&gt; Pocket-lint We didn&apos;t cover this as we were busy with LulzSec/Anonymous the other day:   From Monday, you&apos;ll no longer download apps from the Android Market, but instead, from Google Play. Over the next few days the firm will push out an update to Android handsets that changes the name of the app you were using. This might confuse some, especially as Market updates tend to happen more automatically than most. Nothing much changes though. The name is to reflect the new multimedia store that sells not only apps, but music, videos and ebooks too. This was something that Android Market did before, with sections for apps, movies and books growing out of the original offering which was solely for apps. Google is also hoping that this new name, and some minor tweaks, will make people spend more money. That might be true, but we can&apos;t see anyone being prepared to cough up 4.49 to rent &quot;The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption&quot;.  Eben Upton of Raspberry Pi interviewed &gt;&gt; Nottingham Science Blog  Eben Upton, one of the trustees of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, kindly agreed to an interview with NSB recently. It was a fascinating discussion, touching on how the number of people studying Computer Science has dropped over the last 10-15years, tips for youngsters who want to enter this field, and what it has been like to develop the Raspberry Pi device. A transcript of the best bits is shown below. Enjoy.   This has been one of the most eagerly-awaited pieces of British technology we can ever remember. And we have long memories. We Need to Talk About Android &gt;&gt; Fraser Speirs  I spoke at a conference near Cardiff recently and in Q&amp;A, I got The Question. I love getting the question. What&apos;s the question? This: &quot;What&apos;s wrong with Android?&quot; I realised, giving my answer, that I&apos;ve never written down my objections to Android. Before we get into this, let&apos;s understand that I&apos;m primarily talking about &quot;what&apos;s wrong with Android from the perspective of someone planning a long-term 1:1 deployment in a school&quot;.   Though one would have thought that you could replace &quot;school&quot; with &quot;enterprise&quot;. Though perhaps enterprises have more money for customising things such as backup. Note one of his conclusions: &quot;You&apos;re either buying into a platform or you&apos;re buying gadgets.&quot; Inside the mind of a hacker &gt;&gt; Fox News Fox had the scoop on Sabu. This however reads a bit like A Doctor Writes in Private Eye:   There has been no indication thus far that Monsegur is a methodical criminal who has amassed a great fortune. Nor has anyone suggested that he is a cyber-terrorist attacking entities that oppose his political or religious ideology (though time will tell). Instead, the data at hand would suggest that chaos, in and of itself, is the reward he seeks--busting things up, bringing them down, causing people to suffer as the structure they rely upon to organize their thoughts and intentions dissolves.   Note that it also hits Godwin&apos;s Law a few paragraphs later. Was Anonymous&apos; hacker-informant Sabu a tool of FBI entrapment? &gt;&gt; Forbes Obvious question:   criminal defense lawyers for those accused hackers are no doubt poring over [Sabu&apos;s] communications with their clients, and looking for evidence of entrapment: the defense that the U.S. government, with an influential member of Anonymous as their pawn, pushed hackers into the same illegal acts for which they&apos;re now prosecuting them. Months after Monsegur [Sabu&apos;s real name] began cooperating with law enforcement, his Twitter feed (with 45,000 followers) continued to rally his hacktivist &quot;brothers&quot; to attack governments and private corporate targets. A message he wrote in late December asked for fellow hackers to give him stolen documents so that they could be published under the banner of &quot;Antisec,&quot; the sub-movement against the security industry in which he was a vocal organizer. &quot;Leakers, security researchers or hackers who have vulnerabilities or leaked docs contact us,&quot; Monsegur wrote.   One would hope the FBI had that figured out already, given it was monitoring his communication 24/7. Google looking to unload Motorola&apos;s TV set-top box business &gt;&gt; NYPOST.com It&apos;s the New York Post, a tabloid, but then Fox News had the Sabu scoop earlier this week:   This just in: The TV set-top box is on its deathbed. Google is looking to unload the set-top box business it will inherit from Motorola Mobility even before it closes on the $12.5 billion acquisition, The Post has learned. The move appears to be an about-face from last August, when Google CEO Larry Page, in announcing the deal, suggested the business would play a role in his plans for revolutionizing the living room. Google isn&apos;t the only player looking to get out of the business. As The Post reported exclusively last month, Cisco is also seeking to sell Scientific Atlanta, which along with Motorola has had a near duopoly on the set-top box business.   Point being that the set-top box business is the only profitable part of MMI. Microsoft and Apple should hit Amazon, not Google &gt;&gt; The Register Matt Asay:   Amazon&apos;s fork of Google&apos;s Android is a far bigger threat to Apple&apos;s iOS than Samsung or other Android licensees ever were, because it comes backed by an entire ecosystem of Amazon-supplied content. This hurts Apple, but it also minimises Google&apos;s benefits from Android, as well, as Amazon&apos;s Kindle Fire comes with an Amazon browser, not Google&apos;s. And Amazon, not Google (or Apple) cleans up on content purchased through the device.  Apple Special Event March 2012 &gt;&gt; Apple Wednesday&apos;s introduction of &quot;The New iPad&quot;, and associated things.

    "headline": "Why tech advertisers should target women", 
    "text": "Why are technology products still thought of as &quot;boys&apos; toys&quot; and tech ads often prevalent during football tournaments? More smartphones were bought by women than men in 2010 and a study out today by YouGov and Lady Geek has shown that 79% of women now have the biggest input when buying a new TV for the household. Women are more likely to use an internet-connected TV or Smart TV, more likely to use catchup services and more likely to stream on-demand content. The survey of 1,056 people showed that a man&apos;s influence on household technology declines after 35  around the time when he stops buying toys for himself and starts thinking about his family. For a woman, the opposite happens, with her influence increasing at that age. These stats should become increasingly important to TV manufacturers and content providers. Yet still older women are about as welcome in a technology store as they are at a boy-scout meeting. But as the battle for the living room heats up, our study shows that neglecting the older female market represents commercial suicide. The whole situation is a byproduct of an age-old problem  there just simply aren&apos;t enough women working in technology. Of course, TVs and computers are going to be seen as being &quot;boy&apos;s toys&quot;. Boys design them, boys make them and boys sell them. There have been many arguments in recent years as to why the technology industry needs to up its game on gender equality, and each of them have their merits. But, ultimately, tech companies are businesses, and if we really want to make a difference we have to start appealing to their wallets. This new study should present enough of a financial incentive to shock the industry into changing its ways and embracing women, before it&apos;s too late. The next time I&apos;m locked in a sales scenario with a teenage stat-machine I may just have a figure of my own to throw at him. The estimated cost of neglecting female technology consumers in the UK is a whopping 588 million. Surely worth a few ads of its own. @belindaparmar is the CEO of Lady Geek.",

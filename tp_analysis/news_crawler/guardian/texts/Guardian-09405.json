    "text": "Half an announcement Education Guardian has gained a glimpse into the extraordinarily last-minute  some might say chaotic  nature of planning for the reform of England&apos;s secondary curriculum. Officials at the Department for Education were expecting Michael Gove to make an announcement on the curriculum programmes of study for 11- to 16-year-olds alongside that of his new GCSE-replacement exam, the English Baccalaureate Certificate (EBC), last month. The plans were changed at the last minute. An email exchange seen by this newspaper makes clear that, as of 13 September, DfE civil servants were expecting the secondary curriculum announcement to be made the following week. But late on Saturday 15 September, the Mail on Sunday broke the story of Gove&apos;s GCSE reform plans. The formal announcement on the EBC was then brought forward from the following Tuesday to the Monday. But there was no official news about what was happening to the secondary curriculum. Even early on the Monday morning, DfE civil servants were unsure as to whether the curriculum announcement was to be made alongside the EBC move. A DfE email says: &quot;They [GCSE reform and the curriculum] are meant to come together but they may have been &apos;decoupled&apos; somehow over the weekend.&quot; By Monday lunchtime, shortly before the EBC announcement, another email says: &quot;I have just had it confirmed that today&apos;s forthcoming announcement will only be on qualifications so there will be nothing on the secondary national curriculum decisions. The unknown is when  indeed  we will be announcing the secondary curriculum decisions.&quot; A month on, it is still unclear, though Education Guardian understands January is possible. Late move Meanwhile, evidence reaches us that the EBC itself may represent a very recent change of course for the education secretary. In January, John Melhuish, a grandfather and former teacher from Peterborough, wrote to Gove to ask him to get rid of GCSEs, arguing that his grandson had done &quot;virtually no new work&quot; over two terms preparing for them, that this was an appalling waste of learning time and that we should just have exams at 18 now. In February, civil servant Val Shiels, of the DfE&apos;s public communications unit, wrote back. &quot;Ministers have no plans to scrap GCSEs at age 16 because they remain an important exam and a key part of pupils&apos; progress to further learning and work,&quot; adding: &quot;Ministers aim to restore confidence in GCSEs as valued, robust qualifications.&quot; Four months later, the Daily Mail was leaked an apparent plan by Gove to replace GCSEs with a return to O-level style exams. Eventually launching his EBCs last month, Gove said he was tackling years of &quot;drift, decline and dumbing-down&quot;. Silent investigation Finally, the findings of an investigation into alleged exam cheating at a south London academy praised as &quot;brilliant&quot; by David Cameron are likely to be kept secret, exam boards have confirmed. Detailed allegations from teachers and pupils of cheating at Kingsdale foundation school in Southwark were the subject of a Channel 4 News broadcast 10 days ago. The report highlighted an inquiry being conducted by several boards, which have still not published any verdict, almost 18 months after complaints were first raised. The school has said the investigation has not highlighted any evidence of institutional malpractice. The Joint Council for Qualifications, an umbrella body for the exam boards which is now handling communications on the investigation, told us that, as things stood, no report would be published. &quot;There&apos;s no plan at present to publish a report. It remains an issue between the awarding bodies, the individuals concerned and the school,&quot; the JCQ said. Whistleblowing teachers are furious.",

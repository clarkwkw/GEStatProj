    "text": "Movie tie-ins are usually rightly dreaded  cheap cash-ins designed purely to fleece fans of a few extra quid. However, there&apos;s been a recent trend towards innovative, and enjoyable, mobile games to accompany big cinema releases, of which Temple Run: Brave (iOS, App Store, 69p, Disney) is the latest. Based on the new film from Pixar, creators of Toy Story, it&apos;s a fairytale with red-haired heroine Merida at its centre. Though the monkeys that chase you in the original Temple Run have been swapped for a giant, angry bear, the gameplay is largely unchanged. Merida still runs forward at a constant speed, forcing you to jump, duck and dodge obstacles. The addition here is Merida&apos;s trusty bow and arrow, which presents some target shooting along with the more familiar addictive action. DaWindci (iOS, App Store, 2.49, Reality Twist), in contrast, offers more relaxing entertainment as you guide a hot air balloon through forests and over mountaintops. It looks beautiful and the puzzles are impressively engaging, while it&apos;s no easy feat to blow the dirigible through the tricky, narrow landscape and over the finishing line.",

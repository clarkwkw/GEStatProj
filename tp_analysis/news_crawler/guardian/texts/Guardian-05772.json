    "text": "The design principle behind The Square Kilometre Array, the world&apos;s most powerful radio telescope, is that size matters. The telescope will collect radiowaves from space and the more it captures, the fainter the celestial events it can transform into pictures. Unlike conventional optical instruments, radio telescopes can work in bad weather and are less troubled by cosmic dust. But there is a price to pay for this versatility. To work best, they must be sited away from sources of radiowaves, which in a world of ubiquitous telecommunications means the remotest place possible. The decision to split the site for the telescope  between one barren patch of ground in South Africa and another in Australia  does not mean building half a telescope in both. The telescope requires several designs of antennae that pick up radiowaves of different frequencies. The decision means the familiar, steerable, high frequency antennae go to South Africa, and low frequency antennae, which do not move, but collect signals from the whole sky at once, are built in Australia. Both countries had poured money into their sites in anticipation of the telescope and the decision to divide the instrument will ensure that that money and effort are not wasted. But the split will undoubtedly complicate the construction and usage of the telescope, and demand close cooperation between them.",

    "text": "Much of the talk on Guardian Science this week is going to be focused on the Nobel prizes, but being a palaeontologist / zoologist, there&apos;s not exactly much for me to comment on since the whole field of biology is rather reduced to Medicine-Physiology when it comes to the most high profile awards in all of science. However, just as the greatest minds in science and their research are being rewarded in Sweden, around the world students are embarking on their postgraduate degrees and taking their first serious steps towards a (possible) career in research.  For my part, I have just started a short-term teaching contract at a London university and I&apos;m really rather buried in teaching on a large first year undergraduate course and as such this blog has fallen a little bit silent for now. Still, not one to sidestep a good opportunity to recycle good material, I thought I&apos;d flag up a series of posts I wrote some time ago as a guide for research students. I&apos;ve had some very positive feedback from both students and academics over these and they are written to be as generally applicable across the sciences as possible, so hopefully these will help a few people up the first few rungs of the research ladder. Basic advice to young researchers How to complete a PhD How to get hold of papers How to write a paper (and get it published) How to contribute to a paper How to review a paper How to edit a volume of papers How to write a conference abstract Things to do at a meeting How to give a talk How to make a scientific poster How to arrange a meeting All I will add to this is that for any of you starting on this path: work hard, good luck, and may all your reviews be positive.

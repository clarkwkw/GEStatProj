    "headline": "How to bid for a National Teaching Fellowship", 
    "text": "One of the hoary old chestnuts of academic life is the contention that teaching plays second fiddle to research. To get on as an academic, it is argued that you should ditch teaching and instead, research and publish in high impact academic journals. But in an attempt to redress this inequity, the Higher Education Academy introduced National Teaching Fellowships NTFs in 2000. The National Teaching Fellowship Scheme is open to all higher education institutions in England, Northern Ireland and, since Autumn 2010, Wales. Each year up to 55 individual awards of 10,000 are made to recognise individual excellence. And there are currently some 500 NTFs in total. During 2007 I was lucky enough to be awarded a National Teaching Fellowship. I have no doubt whatsoever that my fellowship was crucial to securing promotion to principal lectureship. It also brought me 10,000 which enabled me to attend some wonderful events  most notably International Teaching and Learning Conferences in Edmonton, Canada and Rotorua (NZ). Furthermore, it gave me much greater confidence in what I do, particularly in relation to active and blended learning approaches. The quotes from students and others were humbling and a treasure in themselves. So how do you go about this? And is it worth the effort? The current competitive round of submissions need to be in by 21 March at high noon. First of all you have to be nominated by your university or college. In my case the fact that I had been awarded a University Teaching Fellowship, was the passport to institutional sponsorship. Once over this hurdle there are three more, that comprise the NTF application:  A 1,000 word letter of support from your institution  A statement of how the individual demonstrates excellence relevant to each of the three headline award criteria (5,000 words maximum)  A short CV of no more than 1,500 words The meat of the bid is the second item  a personal statement pitching against three criteria: evidence of individual excellence in enhancing and transforming the student learning experience; evidence of supporting colleagues and influencing support for student learning; and developing excellence in terms of continuing professional development related to teaching and learning. This is a beauty parade, in the sense that you must be prepared to blow your own trumpet; it&apos;s not for the shrinking violet. My own university (Gloucestershire) has 12 NTFs and we deliberately mentor colleagues bidding for a fellowship. So, mentors comment on draft material and help to assemble the supporting institutional statement. I certainly found this assistance invaluable. I was told that I could either go for the safer bet of a chronological story or I could adopt the riskier strategy of putting in something &apos;different&apos;. I took the second tack and began my statement: &quot;Once upon a time....There was a young man who was brought up in North London. James was a child of the sixties  concerned about environmental apocalypse and overpopulation; influenced by the writings of Schumacher (Small is Beautiful) and Rachel Ward&apos;s Silent Spring.&quot; Ironically I hate the academic convention of not using &apos;I&apos;, but on this occasion chose to talk about myself in the third person. I would encourage others to endeavour to tell a compelling and personal story of their journey through teaching and learning. I would also say that short, glowing, quotes from students, graduates, colleagues and practitioners, help to flavour the submission. Once the bid goes in, there then follows...silence! So this year applicants will have to chew their fingernails from end March until July 4. It&apos;s a long wait, and by the time I heard, I was convinced that I hadn&apos;t been successful. As with the 2012 NTFs, I attended an awards ceremony at the Middle Temple in London; and was presented with my award by the universities minister. To improve your chances of getting to that dinner, here are my top tips:  Tell a compelling story tied to the selection criteria  Present supporting evidence: quotes from colleagues, students and graduates: &quot;Jo Fox is the Rolls Royce Phantom V of the history department. She is the lecturer that Harrods would sell.&quot; (History student 2006.)  Remember to accentuate individual excellence  in this arena good is not good enough  Seek out an NTF colleague to help and advise  Use this as an opportunity to reflect on what you do, why you do it and to set down your philosophy in relation to teaching and learning James Derounian is a principal lecturer in community development and local governance and National Teaching Fellow, University of Gloucestershire This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

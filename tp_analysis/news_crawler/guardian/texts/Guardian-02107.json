    "text": "Yahoo is reportedly planning another series of redundancies as the troubled internet giant struggles to keep pace with rivals Google and Facebook. The layoffs, first reported by the technology site All Things D, would be the first major move by the company&apos;s chief executive, Scott Thompson, who took over from Carol Bartz after she was ousted last September. She also presided over wholesale job cuts at the firm. The news comes after a significant shakeup at the top of Yahoo. After Bartz&apos;s departure, co-founder of the firm Jerry Yang, the chairman, Roy Bostock, and three other senior directors left the company. Yahoo&apos;s net income dropped 5% in the fourth quarter of 2011 as the company struggled to keep up with Google in search advertising and Facebook in display advertising. &quot;In 2012 we will be aligning resources behind key areas of focus to enable us to move aggressively in market and grow our business, bringing innovative new products and experiences to both our users and advertisers,&quot; Thompson said at the time. According to All Things D, cuts are being considered in public relations, marketing, research, marginal businesses and weaker regional businesses. Thompson is weighing Yahoo&apos;s future as the company has struggled to find buyers for its Asian businesses. The search firm owns a stake in China&apos;s Alibaba as well as sizeable assets in Japan. But talks over the sale of those assets have stalled.",

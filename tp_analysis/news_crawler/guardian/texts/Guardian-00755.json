    "text": "Amid the frenzy of big-name year-end games releases, the non-download, retail version of World of Tanks slipped under the radar. And yet, despite its modest marketing, this free-to-play tank battle sim has attracted over 5m registrations, a huge success for the online multiplayer shooter. And with good reason. The controls are a doddle to pick up and there are numerous mod options, either earned or bought with real-world money, offering advantages such as superior firepower or camouflage. The 500-plus vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, look tremendous and the team battles, with 30 vehicles trundling around the various open maps, are evenly matched to ensure that even newbies aren&apos;t obliterated within seconds. Simple, destructive and fun.",

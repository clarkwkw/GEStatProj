    "headline": "Life after a PhD: how do I find an academic mentor?", 
    "text": "Dear HE careers clinic, During my PhD, I held a variety of jobs from teaching to project management. I&apos;m now an academic development and postgraduate coordinator but both these contracts are about to expire and I&apos;m thinking about my future. I have never had problems finding a job but I have struggled to find actual employment. By this I mean that the jobs I get tend to be temporary, with no career progression, while employment is something more long-term. I think my biggest problem is that I am not sure if I want to stay in academia or leave the ivory tower. I thoroughly enjoy teaching and know that I am very good at it, but I also enjoy project management and troubleshooting and wonder if maybe my dilemma comes from having too many options and being interested in too many things?  How do I work out what to do next? I have been advised to look for a mentor after it was suggested that I am under-applying myself. Could you help with tips on how to find what the right next step is? Should I get a mentor and if so, how do I go about finding a one?   Tweet, post on LinkedIn or Facebook or send your queries to he.careers.clinic@theguardian.com, with HE careers clinic in the subject line. Chosen problems will appear both in the newsletter and on the site where you&apos;ll be able to share your views and experiences. Looking for a job in HE?

    "text": "The dramatic growth in people reading newspapers and magazines via iPads and other tablets means a whole new demand for cartoonists  which is good news for the students on Staffordshire University&apos;s new BA (Hons) in cartoon and comic arts. This is no lightweight degree, according to the course&apos;s principal lecturer, Barbara Ridley. &quot;[Many applicants] are mimicking a particular genre,&quot; she says, &quot;but one thing that&apos;s fundamental to all is their absolute passion for their subject and their very strong ability to draw.&quot; The degree was born out of discussions with employers. &quot;It was an often-heardcomplaint from design directors of national newspapers that there appeared to be no young, up-and-coming creative students who had a particular skill or passion for cartooning,&quot; saysRidley. Undergraduates study life drawing, contextual studies, the history of political and social cartooning, contemporary application of comic arts and the resurgence of the graphic novel. Graduates are expected to embark on careers in multimedia, web and gaming design, media, story-boarding for advertising and film, among other fields. With animation one of the domestic film industry&apos;s fastest-growing areas thanks to home-grown blockbusters like the Harry Potter series, arts degrees like this one are helping to nurture and develop a generation of newtalent.

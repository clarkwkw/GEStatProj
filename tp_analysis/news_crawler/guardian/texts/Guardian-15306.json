    "text": "The debate over whether apps stimulate or stymie children&apos;s creativity rumbles on, with strong opinions on both sides. What&apos;s clear is that some of the biggest children&apos;s entertainment providers are keen for their apps to become more than just passive experiences: they want children to be creating stories, not just reading or watching them. Here are three new examples of this trend, all released within the last week: Toontastic Jr. Shrek, Elmo the Musical Storyteller and Toy Story: Story Theater, for DreamWorks Animation, Sesame Street and Disney respectively. Toontastic Jr. Shrek is the work of a startup called Launchpad Toys, and represents the first time it has worked with a big brand, following on from the Toontastic: All Access and Toontastic Jr. Pirates apps it released in 2012. The apps all involve children choosing scenery, characters and items, then animating them while recording their own voice telling a story. The results can then be shared with friends and family by their parents. The new Shrek app also includes a feature called StoryShare for remote collaboration. The idea being that children can co-create stories over the internet with cousins, grandparents or anyone else approved by their parents (i.e. not strangers). Elmo the Musical Storyteller does a similar thing for a new segment on Sesame Street&apos;s TV show, getting children to choose an outfit for Elmo, create scenes with characters and objects, record their voices telling a story, then watch the whole thing back. Sesame Street makes a point of suggesting parents should be involved in this process, rather than seeing the app as purely a babysitting tool. A tips section offers advice on &quot;helping your child create imaginative stories&quot;, while parents are also put in control of sending the stories to friends and family. Finally, Toy Story: Story Theater is the third app of its kind from Disney, following previous releases for Sofia the First and its Disney Princesses. The pattern should be familiar by now: children choose a setting, characters, props and actions, then record their own voice narration to describe what&apos;s happening. Aimed (like the others) at 3-7 year-old children, it too provides an in-app guide for parents and carers suggesting &quot;offline activities to extend the learning&quot;.     Toontastic Jr. Shrek encourages children to share    The theory behind all these apps and others that went before like book publisher Collins&apos; series of Big Cat apps is to help children explore the basics of story structure, encourage imaginative play, and increasingly to collaborate with friends or family in the process. This sounds good, especially as it complements rather than replaces what children are learning at school, and the knowledge they&apos;re soaking up from reading (or being read) stories with their parents. But it&apos;s making me think again about digital haves and have-nots. The three apps mentioned above are all iOS-only for now, so children using their parents&apos; Android or Windows 8 devices are out of luck not to mention kids who don&apos;t have access to apps at all. Technology as a tool for creating stories as well as reading them is a positive thing, and teaming it with well-loved characters like Shrek, Elmo and the Toy Story gang has plenty of potential. But it should also stimulate more discussion about how to make these apps accessible from a wider range of devices HTML5 may well have an important role to play here and how to get more of those devices into the hands of more children, whether at home or at school.",

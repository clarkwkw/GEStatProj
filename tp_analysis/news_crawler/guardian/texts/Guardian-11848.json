    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Pixel Defenders Puzzle is a match-three game with several extra dimensions to its complex ruleset. In it, you place three pixels next to each other to make a basic warrior, three warriors make a tougher warrior, and three of those make a super-warrior. Depending on pixel colour, you can create barbarians, wizards and rangers, so you need to be careful to group them so that they can easily be upgraded. Each turn earns action points, which you spend attacking the enemy, whose sole job is to kill your VIP, a piece that continually moves around the board and can&apos;t attack. Some units temporarily power-up friends or hobble foes, and all eventually turn into a rock or tree stump when their action points have been spent. The result is a series of interwoven systems that take considerable concentration to manage effectively, especially when the enemies get more devious as levels progress, with magical foes that attack more frequently and vanish at will. Presented in mock 8-bit style with &quot;chip tune&quot; music that gets a bit full-on after a while, it&apos;s a mentally testing puzzle game that has nothing whatsoever to do with dexterity.",

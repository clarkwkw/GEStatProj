    "text": "State boarding schools are witnessing a surge in popularity, with the number of places rising by a quarter over the past decade  an increase driven in part by family breakdown, which has in effect left some children homeless. Two academies have opened boarding facilities this term, and a third is due to open residential quarters in September, raising the number of children in state boarding to more than 5,000 from 3,800 at the start of the last decade. Five more academies plan to open boarding facilities, including one in south London, which hopes to send inner-city children to board in Sussex. Instead of the cold showers and ascetic dormitories of public school tradition, modern boarding quarters feature purpose-built blocks with ensuite bedrooms, access to Wi-Fi and thumb-print recognition entry systems. The Harefield academy in Hillingdon opened a boarding facility with 50 places this academic year, mainly to provide for children with difficult home lives. This includes pupils who were &quot;sofa surfing&quot; because of family breakdown or the death of a parent. The school also selects 15 children a year for their sporting excellence, and some of these pupils have chosen to board because they were commuting long distances or because they wanted more time to train. Boarding has helped diversify the school, which now includes two boys from the Bahamas and children from Spain. Principal Lynn Gadd said: &quot;Harefield is very white, working class, and we felt we needed a slightly bigger global dimension, so we offered a few places to students who could bring that richness.&quot; Hilary Moriarty, director of the boarding schools&apos; association, suggested that changes to working lives had increased the appeal of boarding for families. She said: &quot;Many boarding schools now offer weekly boarding, which is an attractive proposition for many families, particularly if mum and dad both work  on Monday we all go to work, see you on Friday. If you&apos;re on a train at 7am, get home at 7.30 or 8pm, there&apos;s very little time for the kind of ideal vision of family life that we had 30 years ago.&quot; At Ashby school in Leicestershire, which has almost doubled its boarding wing to 72 places this academic year, headteacher Eddie Green concurred: &quot;There&apos;s a number of reasons [why children board]. Modern family life is one of them. Parents are working overseas, or working longer hours. We have students coming from abroad who value the English educational system. Quite a lot are from Hong Kong. We&apos;ve got students from EU countries where the parents have gone to live abroad.&quot; Boarding school accommodation is being created around the country. Priory academy in Lincoln is due to open a sixth-form boarding house with 60 places in September 2012, catering for demand from RAF families and pupils who commute long-distance. The Wellington academy in Wiltshire, sponsored by the public school Wellington College, opened twin boarding houses for 100 students this academic year. One of the most ambitious boarding school projects is a plan by a school in Stockwell, south London, to set up a satellite school for its pupils in the home counties. Durand Academy plans to open a junior school in London this autumn, and from 2014 students will attend a boarding school in Sussex. Under the plan, which has received 17m of government funding for building work, pupils will be driven to Sussex on Monday and return home on Friday. The aim is to move children to an environment free from negative influences and offer an extended school day combining study with music, drama and sport. Unlike other state boarding schools, it will not charge for accommodation. Instead, its running costs will come out of private income the school generates from a swimming pool, gym and block of flats. A similar motive drives plans for a boarding &quot;free school&quot;, which will admit children at risk of going into care. About 20 children in each year-group of this proposed school would have been identified by social workers as being at risk of entering care, its backers say. The school would have a &quot;family&quot; system of house-parents providing pastoral care for the boarders. Lee Donaghy, who is proposing the school with his wife, Ann, said: &quot;Our central motivation is to give the most disadvantaged and marginalised children in society an educational experience that is on a par with the very best that&apos;s on offer in British schooling. One thing that struck us powerfully was a state boarding school head saying that boarding provision for this group of children works because for the first time in their lives they have access to something that others desire  and are even prepared to pay for.&quot; The proposed free school, which would open in 2014, would be based wherever the need is greatest, Donaghy added. Other state boarding schools are urging the government to provide funding for building work so they can expand. State boarding scho ols are permitted to charge parents to cover accommodation costs  with fees of 10,000-12,000  but restricted from charging more. This limits their ability to accumulate surpluses for construction work. Ray McGovern, chairman of the State Boarding Schools Association, said: &quot;If we manage to get the investment, then we can fund other children who need boarding places but whose families can&apos;t afford it. But we need to know what the government&apos;s strategy is going to be.&quot;  This article was amended on 1 February 2012.

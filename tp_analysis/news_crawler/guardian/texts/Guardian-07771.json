    "text": "The weekly Android Apps Rush post is back to Fridays after last week&apos;s lateness. As ever, this roundup doesn&apos;t include new Android games you can find those here. The weekly iOS roundup will be published later in the day. Here&apos;s this week&apos;s Android selection: John Lewis The British retailer has launched its official Android app, promising details from its 200,000-product catalogue, and the ability to scan items in-store to find out more information and watch videos. If you want to actually buy from within the app, you&apos;re directed back out to the John Lewis mobile site. O2 Priority Sports Mobile operator O2&apos;s latest app is a partnership with Nike: the Priority Sports club. It&apos;s dangling the prospect of &quot;exclusive access to Nike offers and experiences&quot; for O2 customers, as well as the option to buy products from within the app. Karaoke by PureSolo PureSolo has been helping people record and share their own versions of classic songs on its website for some time now, but the company is taking the experience mobile. You can browse tracks from genres including pop, rock and hip-hop, then share the results to Facebook and Twitter. DriveOFF A mobile app designed to help you stop getting distracted by mobile apps when driving? Sounds like a good idea. It&apos;s the work of esure, analysing your speed when driving, and turning off all notifications and incoming calls once you&apos;re going faster than 10mph. Waterside Challenge This is actually a web-app optimised to run on Android (and iPhone) smartphones from conservation charity WWF. Its aim is to get people exploring London&apos;s waterways and looking out for wildlife, using quizzes, videos and simulations. Popcorn Player This app&apos;s in alpha, so it&apos;s early days, but you may wish to get in early and provide feedback to the developer to help it evolve. Available for smartphones and tablets, it&apos;s a pop-up video player that can float on top of your homescreen. MP4 and WebM formats are supported, as well as YouTube. BirdGuides More wildlife action here with the official app for the BirdGuides website, providing news on all things feathered from around the UK and Ireland, as well as photos from contributors. Registered users can upload their sightings from within the app. Confused.com MotorMate Driving safety is also high on the Android agenda this week, with this collaboration between Confused.com and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. This app runs in the background and tracks your driving habits over 250 miles, before presenting you with a rating (out of five stars) based on your skills. Pairin There&apos;s a rash of &quot;social-network-for-couples&quot; apps on iOS, but Pairin is one of the few to have made the jump to Android. This is a private social network for sharing comments, photos and Kimochi stamps (&quot;aka emoticon on steroids&quot;) with a distinctly Japanese feel. ShuckRelay This is another alpha release for early adopters. ShuckRelay is a podcast player and management app capable of handling subscriptions and individual episodes of audio podcasts, using their feed URLs. Support for video and Google Reader is promised for the future. That&apos;s our selection, but what has impressed you on Android this week? Share your recommendations or experiences with the above apps in the comments section.",

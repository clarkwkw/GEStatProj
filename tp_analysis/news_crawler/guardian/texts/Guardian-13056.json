    "text": "As the first university to open a fully operational branch campus in Malaysia in 2000, internationalisation has been in the University of Nottingham DNA for well over a decade. It has since opened a further campus in China, and says that global reach is &quot;hardwired&quot; into its strategic plan.  Ambition on such a scale means you can&apos;t keep your recruitment exclusively based in the UK, so Nottingham has international student recruiters employed in regional offices in Malaysia, China, Brazil and Mexico. The university&apos;s West Africa office opened in Accra in April 2012 and an India office opened in June last year.  It&apos;s an approach that&apos;s getting results: over 9,500 students are enrolled in Malaysia and China, and as well as having one of the largest cohorts of international students in the UK, Nottingham is a top 10 recruiter (by volume) in most markets worldwide. With 25% of the university&apos;s academic staff being international, the institution&apos;s commitment to sourcing the best talent available means it also runs one of the largest scholarship programmes for the developing world, explains professor Hai-Sui Yu, pro-vice-chancellor for internationalisation. Staff and students also benefit from partnerships with commercial partners in 25 countries across the globe. The breadth of international academic expertise on which Nottingham can draw means it can conduct co-ordinated research on some of the most pressing global human concerns and social problems in three different national contexts.  Currently this includes major research initiatives such as the Crops for the Future research centre in Malaysia, which was given funding approaching $40m from the Malaysian government. A new 17 million International Doctoral Innovation Centre at the university&apos;s China campus will train 100 of the brightest PhD students - who&apos;ll split their time between the the UK and China - in the fields of energy and digital technologies. And in the longer term, the geographical and cultural spread of the university&apos;s student body is creating a global alumni network that is extensive and growing fast.  &quot;It&apos;s not enough to have outstandingly successful and growing international campuses,&quot; concludes Yu. &quot;This has to permeate the institution from top to bottom.&quot;  The delivery of education must be excellent in every respect, and while size is not necessarily a measure of quality, Yu says that &quot;both Asia campuses are larger than some UK universities and despite their relative youth, are already punching above their weight in both research and teaching.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

    "text": "A drive to get more children into school in the developing world is grinding to a halt as aid for education stagnates, amid fears that this will fall faster than overall aid levels. The education for all (EFA) global monitoring report, Putting education to work, said that on current trends, the millennium development goal (MDG) of universal primary education by 2015 will be missed by a large margin. The number of primary school age children out of school has fallen from 108 million to 61 million since 1999, but most of this reduction was achieved between 1999 and 2004. Progress stalled between 2008 and 2010, with the number of children out of school stuck around the 60 million mark. At the world education forum in Dakar, Senegal, in 2000, 164 governments pledged to provide education for all and identified six goals to be met by 2015, but the report expresses concern that progress is slowing as donor contributions decline. &quot;More money alone will not ensure that education for all goals are reached, but less money will certainly be harmful. A renewed and concerted effort by aid donors is urgently needed,&quot; the report said. The report said a fifth of young people in developing countries  200 million people aged 15 to 24  fail to complete primary school and lack skills for work. &quot;Youth and skills is a burning theme,&quot; said Pauline Rose, director of the EFA report. &quot;A large number is not even making it to the end of primary school. It&apos;s partly fuelling youth frustration, which played a part in the Arab spring. The voices of these people are getting forgotten, they are getting left behind. Donors need to pay attention.&quot; In 2010, aid for education hit a plateau of $13.5bn (8.4bn), reflecting a reduction in overall aid as donor governments tightened their belts after the 2008 financial crisis, with only $1.9bn allocated for basic education in low-income countries, well short of the amount needed to fill a $16bn funding gap. The report said key donors may make education a lower priority, leading to a faster drop in education aid than in overall aid. The Netherlands, one of the top three donors to basic education in the past decade, no longer considers education a key priority and is expected to cut aid to education by 60% between 2010 and 2015. It is set to withdraw from Burkino Faso, for example, at the same time as four other donors have said they intend to pull out of education in the country. &quot;There are worrying signs that aid to education may be slowing down just when children and young people need it most,&quot; said Rose. &quot;Governments and donors must find the money and energy to help young people most in need to acquire the skills they and their countries&apos; economies desperately need.&quot; Rose suggested that the private sector could step in. The private sector contributes the equivalent of 5% of total official aid to education, with most of that money given by five corporations. &quot;Reallocating aid could help fill the funding gap,&quot; said the report, which points out that $3.1bn of aid to post-secondary education never reaches developing countries as it is used to fund foreign students in donor countries. In 2010, for example, France spent four times as much on foreign students studying in France as it did on aid to general secondary education and vocational training. &quot;These funds could be better spent addressing the skills deficit for disadvantaged youth in poor countries,&quot; said the report. &quot;The cost of one Nepalese student&apos;s scholarship in Japan could give 229 students access to secondary education at home.&quot; Countries with natural resources could invest more in education to fill the funding gap. Nigeria, for example, is a large exporter of oil and gas, but has the largest number of children out of school  10.5 million or one in six of the world&apos;s out-of-school children. By contrast, Botswana has financed education during past decades on the back of diamonds that have made it one of sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s richest countries. The report cited Ethiopia as a country that is making skills development a cornerstone of its national growth strategy, with the ambition of reaching middle-income status by 2025. Ethiopia aims to achieve universal secondary school enrolment by 2020 while emphasising skills in agricultural and industrial sectors. It is focusing on increasing the productivity of micro and small businesses, where many disadvantaged people work. Sandra Dworack, education expert for Oxfam, said: &quot;The report says that for every dollar spent on a person&apos;s education it will bring back $10 -15 in economic growth over that person&apos;s working lifetime. Investing in education is a way of investing in a future generation who won&apos;t need aid, because they have the skills and education to build a life free from poverty.&quot; There is an urgent need for donors to commit to skills development in three ways, said the report: by supporting country programmes to ensure all young people can stay in school at least until lower secondary level; by supporting second-chance programmes for young people who missed out on basic literacy and numeracy skills; and by giving disadvantaged youth training to improve their chances of earning a decent wage. Enrolling all people up to lower secondary level would cost $8bn annually, in addition to the $16bn needed to achieve universal basic education by 2015.",

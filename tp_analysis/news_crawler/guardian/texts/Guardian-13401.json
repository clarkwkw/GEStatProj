Click here to view The subject of nine video games and two films, Tomb Raider is a franchise you wouldn&apos;t accuse of commercial under-exploitation. During the course of this process, its heroine, Lara Croft, metamorphosed from accidental post-feminist icon to joyless, melon-chested caricature. In other words: time for a reboot.  What it used to be  A nubile, independent, lady Indiana Jones takes archaeology into the twin pistol-wielding era. The reboot  Lara&apos;s 21 years old and setting off on an adventure that immediately turns into a fight for survival with the capacity to break a lot more than fingernails. There are still tombs to raid, but your main concern is staying alive, and helping your disparate band of shipwrecked chums do the same by upgrading weapons and skills as well as slaughtering bad guys. Any good? The danger feels a bit ersatz, but the shaky-cam action is appropriately skin-of-the-teeth. Syndicate     It's either Syndicate or every other first person shooter ever.    What it used to be  An unusually thoughtful game of real-time tactics set against a backdrop of ruthless corporate rivalry. The reboot  Taking a much-loved series and discarding everything apart from its name and its protagonists&apos; penchant for wearing trench coats is either very bold or a bit silly. The ensuing, lukewarm first-person shooting action suggests the latter, squandering interesting source material in favour of blandly standard gunplay with a bit of parkour shoehorned in, apparently in preference to having any new ideas.  Any good?  Although not completely terrible, this is not a good game. Batman     Batman: when he's not in Bradford he can generally be found duffing up goons in Arkham.    What it used to be  A succession of forgettable 80s and 90s side-scrolling beat-&apos;em-ups. The reboot  Arkham Asylum sees a growling, muscular Batman laying just-less-than-lethal waste to armies of the Joker&apos;s henchmen and super-villainous friends, who&apos;ve invaded Gotham&apos;s asylum for the criminally insane. The fights are gritty, and Batman&apos;s need to stalk gun-wielding assailants provides perfectly judged shifts in pace that get you to observe and plan rather than simply steaming in with fists windmilling. Any good?  Absolutely great, and it&apos;s already spawned a similarly hearty sequel. Spyro The Dragon     A dragon, called Spyro, AKA Spyro The Dragon.    What it used to be  A set of third-rate platform games starring a slightly characterless dragon. The reboot  Skylanders is Activision&apos;s answer to the awesome addictive collect-&apos;em-all power of Pokmon. It employs all sorts of clever psychological trickery to hook its young devotees, from beautifully designed plastic figurines to a poster letting you know how many more you need to buy before you can be happy. It&apos;s easy to be cynical, but there&apos;s a decent game buried under the scary addiction-enablement. Any good?  Yes, although parents should know that a complete set costs just the 300. DmC: Devil May Cry     DmC's Dante: a right barrel of laughs.    What it used to be  A fast-moving, stylish hack-and-slash game with a supernatural Japanese flavour. The reboot  Made in Britain, the new DmC still moves like lightning and involves scything multitudes of demons to ribbons with a progression of outlandish weaponry. It&apos;s also managed to eke out a much-needed sense of humour, as well as having discovered mod fashion along the way. It&apos;s even a bit easier, although getting good at it still demands the total dedication series fans like to bring to bear. Any good? Very, managing to please the devotees while extending a razor-fanged welcome to newcomers. Wolfenstein     One of Wolfenstein's many, many undead Nazis.    What it used to be  The founding father of first-person shooters and the original game to pit you against zombie Nazis. The reboot  You&apos;re still fighting &quot;ze Chermans&quot;, but bog-standard weapons, and the fact that everyone else has got in on the act by this point, have left Wolfenstein&apos;s updates looking run-of-the-mill. Accidentally ludicrous Teutonic accents apart, this is a game short of any real point of difference in a world that has caught up and then moved on. Any good? The limit to the number of polygon Nazis you can shoot turns out to be governed by the boredom threshold.",

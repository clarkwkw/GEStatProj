    "text": "A rare &apos;spotless&apos; cheetah has been photographed in Kenya by wildlife photographer Guy Combes, who got within around 50m of the big cat. Combes, originally from Dorset but now based in California, had heard tale of the spotless leopard and travelled to the Athi Kapiti Conservancy in search of it but gave up after days of fruitless searching. &quot;I didn&apos;t think it likely that we would find the cheetah and went back to Nairobi. I then got a call saying it had been seen again so I spent another two days searching,&quot; he said. Eventually he spotted the animal. &quot;I was really excited as we managed to get about 50 yards away. It was was a staggeringly beautiful animal. I didn&apos;t expect to see it at all, the area we were going to search was 100,000 acres without borders and it could have easily been beyond that.&quot; John Pullen, curator of mammals at Marwell Wildlife in Hampshire, who has examined the photographs, described the sighting as &quot;quite rare&quot;. He said: &quot;There are some spots still evident over the back area but most are missing. The spots or markings on all wild cats are in fact the skin colour and the hair growing from that part of the skin takes on the colouration, so if you shaved off the hair the pattern would be the same. This is really like a rare skin issue where something has happened to the genetic coding that would give the normal pattern.&quot; Combes captured the images last year but has shown it now after photographs of a strawberry-coloured leopard photographed in South Africa emerged. It also comes as footage and images of a white killer whale spotted off the eastern coast of Russia surfaced.",

    "text": "Angry Birds fans craving a fresh fix of Rovio&apos;s game franchise can breathe a sigh of relief: the latest instalment, Angry Birds Space, has now been launched on several devices. The new game is available for iPhone and in a separate HD version for iPad, costing 0.69 and 1.99 respectively. An Android version is also now live as a free download and in-game advertisements, while Rovio is selling a PC version from its own online shop, and a Mac version in Apple&apos;s Mac Store. Ad-free versions of the Android game will follow. While the core formula of catapulting birds at pigs remains intact, Angry Birds Space adds new gameplay elements including gravitational fields, and new birds with their own destructive capabilities. There is also a new power-up Space Eagles which can be earned by playing or bought as an in-app purchase. 60 levels are included in the initial game, but more will be added as free updates and in-app purchases. &quot;This launch marks a huge step for us as a company, and our whole team and partners have really pulled together to bring out a fantastic array of exciting products and experiences.,&quot; says chief executive Mikael Hed in a statement. &quot;We hope that our fans will find all things Angry Birds Space as delightful as the Rovio family does.&quot; Rovio has previously promised an official companion book published by National Geographic as well as animation and retail elements for the Angry Birds Space launch. Nickelodeon will be screening an exclusive short film based on the game on Friday 23 March, which will include six new bird characters. Device-maker Samsung is also a key partner for the Angry Birds Space launch, with an exclusive level for owners of its Galaxy Note device who get the new game. The animation includes this video explaining how the bird characters got into Space in the first place:            Rovio will be hoping the new game continues the startling growth for Angry Birds, which had passed 700m downloads on all platforms last time the company released public figures. With the three previous games in the series still riding high in app stores, the franchise is likely now closer to 1bn a milestone that Angry Birds Space may well help it surpass sooner rather than later. &quot;It&apos;s the first time we have everything available on launch day: animation, toys, books, candy, everything. It&apos;s massive: most Hollywood movies don&apos;t have this. And this is just the first phase of our space programme. There is more to come,&quot; Rovio&apos;s Peter Vesterbacka told The Guardian in February 2012, while preparing for the launch. Rovio is also rolling out some stunts for launch day. That includes an installation piece in Seattle at the Space Needle landmark featuring a 300-foot tall slingshot and giant Angry Bird. US mobile operator T-Mobile is the partner on that.",

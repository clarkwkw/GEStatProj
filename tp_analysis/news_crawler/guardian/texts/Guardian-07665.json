    "text": "When the original Pro Skater was launched in 1999 it had a substantial impact. Taking elements from seemingly unrelated gaming forms  a few of the controls from beat &apos;em-ups, some of the open-world structure of Grand Theft Auto  it prompted a renaissance of living-room extreme sports titles. Pro Skater spawned a whole new genre and numerous sequels but eventually lost its way. Here many levels from that initial release return, bundled up with stages from the second in the series, given an HD spit and polish and embellished with a handful of abilities absent 13 years ago. For anyone with nostalgic memories of Tony Hawk&apos;s debut, the results of this remake are likely to delight, as rediscovering old virtual haunts with new ways to manipulate the skateboard beneath your character&apos;s feet are unquestionably rewarding. Those new to the genre, however, may be less impressed. The Tony Hawk template has not aged flawlessly, and the execution of this reworking lacks a little finesse. Thus, while all the refined elements of the original games have survived the translation  including the sublime level design  some ungainly movements have been introduced, making the release feel rather dated.",

    "text": "   Engineers Save Lives: Badges at Big Bang Fair    Sitting in the pub with some friends last year, one of them pulled out a toy submarine they&apos;d picked up at a science education event. It was one of those squishy stress reliever things, and had BAE&apos;s logo on the side. BAE make a range of products, including real nuclear submarines, not just toys. And drones, fighter planes. That sort of thing. We passed it around the table, poking at it, slightly aghast. The very idea of a nuclear submarine stress reliever felt wrong, let alone that it was used to entice young people into careers in science and engineering.  The education event in question was the Big Bang Fair, an annual event promoting science, engineering and maths careers to 7-19 year olds. It&apos;s the largest of its kind in the UK, with more than 50,000 visitors last year. Led by Engineering UK it&apos;s supported by a range of charities as well as the government and industrial sponsors including not only BAE but Shell, Thales, General Dynamics, Rolls-Royce, British Gas and E.ON (full list for 2013 on their site). As you might have spotted, some of these are quite expert in making some very serious bangs out of science and engineering. Rolls-Royce have the contract for Trident, for example. It&apos;s worth noting that sponsors have stalls at the event, it&apos;s not just about giving money.  I&apos;ve been haunted by that weird little nuclear sub toy. I&apos;m also haunted by a meeting about public engagement with science and technology I attended last year, where someone high up in engineering education joked that working with BAE was like &quot;running an arms fair for kids&quot;. I nearly walked out. I wish I had. It&apos;s not something to joke about. But a lot of people I respect are involved in the Big Bang Fair too. I wanted to see the 2013 event for myself. It&apos;s just finished a four-day run at the ExCeL centre in East London. I visited on Saturday, and this is my review. Let me first say what I liked, because there was a lot of good there. UCL&apos;s &quot;Laughter Lab&quot; and the University of Leeds&apos; musical quarries stall were both charming. Unusual too, and clever. I had a brilliantly geeky chat with someone from the National Grid about pylons and adored CIWEM&apos;s simulated sewage and water management activities. GCHQ may have had to hide the details of their current work behind a stall largely rooted in the archives of Bletchley Park, but in doing so, managed to bring a bit of much-needed history of technology to the event. I was also impressed with the E.ON stall, whose staff seemed genuine and dedicated. The best bits were maybe the displays of work from kids themselves, and in that respect Big Bang differs from similar events like the Royal Society summer show, which tends to be more about what scientists have to say. Big Bang reflects something of the American idea of a science fair (in a good way, I thought). But it wasn&apos;t all good. Not by a long way. Admittedly, no squishy subs at the BAE stall this year. Instead they were showing off &quot;bedflex&quot;, designed to help recovering amputees. Obviously it&apos;s great that arms manufacturers do work supporting the recovery of amputees, but it is only a very partial view on their much more diverse portfolio of products and seemed well, simply a bit crass as the only poster about their work. Otherwise, their space was largely games with their mascot robot (play online yourself) or highly decontextualised hands-on maths activities with jars of mints as prizes. Aside from being a distraction from the main focus of their work, I wondered more simply about the point of this stall. You could do all these activities at home.  Saudi Aramco explained drilling for oil with an animation which made the process look like it was topped with a sparkly engagement ring. &quot;They have to use diamond because it&apos;s the only thing that can cut the rock.&quot; I mumbled that I thought it was a bit more complicated than that, before clocking a PR rep handing out guides on teaching petrochemicals to teenagers, stressing &quot;these are great to take into school too&quot;. The woman I spoke to at the Shell space said she was studying primary education and had volunteered after they&apos;d run science workshops as part of her course.  Sellafield seemed to follow BAE in their &quot;do a puzzle, have a sweetie&quot; approach, literally sugar-coating their message with chocolates and sticks of rock to give out to visitors. Arguably, nuclear power has a positive message about energy futures to offer; why couldn&apos;t they trust young people with that? There were also lollipops from Heathrow and Kit Kats from Nestle, though the latter did relate to the exhibit. The National Grid had pens with flashing bulbs at the end. Other stalls had giveaway of Rubik cubes, yo-yos, logobug stickers, canvas bags, and lots and lots of leaflets. It never really shook the feel of a trade fair. Despite the spaces devoted to presenting kids&apos; work, I felt we were being sold a very surface experience of industrialised science and engineering, not invited to meaningfully participate. It was a bit like we were shopping for science, in a rather dystopian mall.  At the centre of the &quot;Energise&quot; section was a &quot;Green STEM&quot; node surrounded by the oil, gas and nuclear brands. The staff at Green STEM emphasised they were government funded, there to promote careers supporting a low carbon economy. They had leaflets inviting you to make a model of a wind farm, but it lacked specifics about how their message might (or might not) link to the energy companies there, or other members of the industry. I found it hard to shake the feeling that the stall served more than greenwash. At the very back of the fair was a stall from the Royal Academy of Engineering covered in &quot;engineers save lives&quot; badges and activities showing off the ways in which engineers could and are working to find practical solutions to some of humanity&apos;s biggest problems. It&apos;s a lovely message, one I wholeheartedly believe in. But there was an element of pathos about it.  Last week, Stuart Parkinson from Scientists for Global Responsibility wrote that Big Bang presents a distorted view of the value of science. Beverley Gibbs, who researches science fairs at the University of Nottingham, replied that it wasn&apos;t really distorted at all, but nearer a mirror of what science and engineering really is. Except it didn&apos;t seem like a very clean mirror to me. Many stalls at the Big Bang Fair obfuscated or, at times, literally sugar-coated the truth. Moreover, education can be about more than what currently is, it can be about changing the status quo. Science and engineering education should invite young people to part of a global, multi-generational conversation about the world they want to build, not just the one they&apos;ve been given. I think the logos of Shell and BAE should be on the floors of such exhibitions, but so should critics like Friends of the Earth and the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, along with academics, teachers, journalists and other voices which would help young people critique and contextualize all sides of the debate, and speak up for themselves. If we trust young people with the technologies of war and climate change, we should trust them with the associated politics too. They deserve honesty.  Scientists and engineers should question whether this event is really something they&apos;re happy to be involved in, as should teachers and parents. Schoolchildren should feel patronised. We should all be worried that science and engineering education has such a limited view of itself. Because the Royal Academy of Engineering is right: Their members do save lives. And that is precisely why they shouldn&apos;t swaddle this vitally important message in the PR fluff of arms manufacturers and oil companies. Let&apos;s hope the 2014 event has more vision.",

[I will identify this bird in 48 hours]  Image: Alex Vargas, 29 April 2010 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D5000, Nikkor 300mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR 1/80s f/6.3 at 300.0mm iso200     Question: Sometimes, I show you pictures of birds because I think they&apos;re gorgeous and I want to share that with you. Well, today is one of those days where I am sharing this particular mystery bird because I never get tired of looking at this species. Can you identify this Central American mystery bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Is this a male or female? The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird&apos;s identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints that may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints, such as puns and anagrams, may read like &quot;inside jokes&quot; and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

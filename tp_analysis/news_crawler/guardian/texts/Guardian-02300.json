    "text": "The most immediately eye-catching element of the lead story from today&apos;s print Guardian is the notion that roads could be part-privatised, with sovereign wealth funds from China and the like encouraged to invest their billions. But if you&apos;re a cyclist  or, in fact, any road user interested in peaceful coexistence  the word to watch out for comes in the fifth paragraph: hypothecation. In the taxation world, this slighly arcane term translates roughly as ring-fencing  when the monies from a specific tax are earmarked for a specific purpose, generally one associated with that revenue stream. As the story points out, this has long been an anathema to the Treasury, which likes to have complete flexibility as to what money goes where, and when. One of the most abiding hypothecation myths, which we&apos;ve covered in this blog more times than I can recount, is that &quot;road tax&quot; is used to pay for roads; hence the shout encountered by many a cyclist over the years: &apos;You&apos;ve not paid for this road, you&apos;ve got no right to use it!&apos; Cycling journalist Carlton Reid has debunked this fallacy more thoroughly than anyone on his exhaustive IpayRoadTax.com website. In its briefest form the facts go like this: roads are paid for out of local and general taxation, while &quot;road tax&quot; is in fact vehicle excise duty, or VED, which is charged according to vehicle emissions. Thus, were cycles liable for VED they would, like electric cars, be zero-rated. As Reid details on the blog, the idea that paying VED gives you special rights to the roads is roughly on a par with assuming that drinking a considerable amount of duty-paid beer entitles you to bigger and better pubs. While the forerunner to VED, the Road Fund, was originally set aside to repair and improve roads, this link was ended more than 70 years ago, in no small part thanks to the efforts of Winston Churchill, who opposed the idea that motorists should be given this sense of entitlement. Is this all to be undone? Whatever the wider arguments against privatising national infrastructure (the most compelling surely being the Railtrack/Network Rail debacle) it would also be a huge shame if some motorists&apos; already significant sense of ownership should get the official seal of approval. There&apos;s two small points of consolation. Firstly, you can feasibly argue that it&apos;s a somewhat moot debate given that most drivers (and even the roads minister, Mike Penning) already think there&apos;s a link between VED and road spending. Plus, there&apos;s the other existing counter-argument: lots of cyclists own cars anyway.",

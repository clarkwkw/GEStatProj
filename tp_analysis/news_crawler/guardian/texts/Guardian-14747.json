    "text": "I love most things about being pregnant. I&apos;m very lucky to have been really healthy through both my pregnancies. And the awareness of the new life taking shape inside me is mind-blowingly wonderful. But there is something about it that I really don&apos;t enjoy  and that&apos;s the pressure to consume. Suddenly, there are all these people trying to sell me stuff. Mostly stuff I really don&apos;t need. I don&apos;t think marketing is inherently evil. Like most mums-to-be, of course I&apos;m buying some things for the baby I&apos;m expecting. But at the same time I&apos;m trying to limit my consumption  reducing, reusing and recycling where I can. But I&apos;m also being targeted as a consumer, and I didn&apos;t expect so much of that pressure to come to me through the NHS. I want to entrust my midwife with looking after me during my pregnancy; I&apos;m very happy for her to give me leaflets containing advice  but not adverts. In my antenatal clinic, there&apos;s a large ring-binder labelled &quot;Information for Pregnant Women&quot;. Inside it there&apos;s a plethora of leaflets for private services, including acupuncture, reflexology and hypnobirthing. The label on the folder also bears a get-out clause in smaller print: &quot;We do not endorse these services. These numbers are for information only.&quot; But placing these leaflets in a folder in an NHS waiting room, and labelling it &quot;Information&quot; (when a more accurate label would be &quot;Adverts aimed at pregnant women&quot;) is plenty of endorsement. The sort of endorsement companies would pay good money for. A couple of maternity hospitals have realised they can make money by offering dubious services to expectant parents. Two hospitals announced such schemes in March, hoping to cash in on their pregnant customers by offering hypnotherapy courses, as reported by Zoe Williams in the Guardian. The latest research looking at the effectiveness of hypnotherapy failed to find any evidence that it helped with either women&apos;s subjective experience of pain during childbirth, or indeed rates of epidural use. If we&apos;re to cling on to an NHS, we need it to cling on to its principles. We need to be able to trust that the NHS is at least aiming for evidence-based medicine, and isn&apos;t out to exploit patients commercially. In fact, NHS-endorsed commercial exploitation of pregnant women isn&apos;t a new phenomenon. It&apos;s been happening for more than 50 years, right across the UK. And it&apos;s still happening, every day. When pregnant with my first baby, I refused to accept the &quot;Bounty Pack&quot; offered to me by my midwife. But this time I decided to find out what this was all about, and I took the pack home. Rather like that folder in the waiting room, it&apos;s not called the &quot;Bounty advertising pack&quot;, it&apos;s the &quot;Bounty Pregnancy Information Folder&quot;. And they really want to make sure you don&apos;t lose it  its says &quot;Carry your maternity notes in this folder&quot; on the flap. In fact, this is just pack number one of five. Packs two and five are available from Bounty&apos;s retail partners, but three packs are delivered to you through the medium of the NHS. The first by &quot;your healthcare professional&quot; at the pregnancy booking appointment, and pack three on the labour ward. Then you can expect a visit from the &quot;Bounty lady&quot; on the maternity ward, bearing pack number four. Back to pack number one. Inside, there&apos;s a booklet, Bump to Birth, bursting with around 50 pages of adverts for nappies, shop clubs, infant painkillers, maternity clothes, prams, nappy creams, as well as plenty of adverts for Bounty itself and reminders to collect the rest of your Bounty packs. The rest of the booklet is full of generic advice. I&apos;m prepared to admit that some of it might be genuinely useful (although available elsewhere  on the NHS website, for instance, where it&apos;s not interspersed with adverts), but much of it is like reading a diluted version of The Little Book of Calm. &quot;Top tips for coping with tiredness&quot; includes such gems as &quot;Work for a bit, rest for a bit.&quot; And &quot;Think about all the tasks you need to do. Can someone else help out?&quot; I&apos;m not sure how I got through my first pregnancy without it Alongside the booklet, there&apos;s a pile of leaflets: another reminder to collect your second Bounty pack, a leaflet encouraging you to join the Bounty parenting club, and others  for life insurance, a junior ISA, a photo book, an iron supplement, online shopping, and a particular washing liquid, as well as a booklet about private antenatal care and newborn heart checks. So why are midwives so keen to deliver this junk mail directly to parents? Why are Bounty reps allowed on maternity wards, to give out more packs, free samples, and to encourage parents to buy photographs of their new baby? The answer is stunningly simple: Bounty pays NHS trusts for theprivilege. In 1984, the British Medical Journal published an investigation that raised concerns about &quot;Bounty exerting commercial pressure on new mothers at a time when they are most vulnerable.&quot; The authors described the breach of trust beautifully: &quot;NHS endorsement is implicit in the way Bounty works with such ease within the hospital Mothers are susceptible to commercial pressure, and this is recognised and exploited by Bounty.&quot; Perhaps you could argue that Bounty is doing something useful, providing all those advice booklets and free samples  and women can always choose not to accept their gifts. But this is happening in the NHS. It seems like exploitation. At the very least, it&apos;s a breach of trust. There are some advantages to being an anatomist. When the Bounty lady approaches me on the maternity ward, I shall tell her, very accurately, exactly where she can stick her free samples.

    "headline": "Science Weekly Podcast: Stephen Hawking at 70", 
    "text": "Over the weekend Professor Stephen Hawking reached the grand age of three score years and ten. Many of the greatest minds in theoretical physics and cosmology attended &quot;The State of the Universe&quot; symposium at Cambridge University to discuss the very latest theoretical insights and pay tribute to Stephen Hawking&apos;s contribution to this field of scientific endeavour. Alok Jha was at the meeting and spoke to many of Hawking&apos;s peers and former students including Cambridge professor of theoretical physics Gary Gibbons, and to Hawking&apos;s biographer Kitty Ferguson. The show includes excerpts from Hawking&apos;s &quot;State of the Universe&quot; address, in which he recalls his childhood in post-war London and his deeply unpromising school career (during which he was nevertheless nicknamed &quot;Einstein&quot;). The Guardian&apos;s science correspondent Ian Sample spoke to Peter Stringfellow, who describes Hawking as his &quot;all time hero&quot; and once had the pleasure of chatting to him at his eponymous nightclub in London&apos;s Covent Garden. Stringfellow reveals that he has met film stars, rock stars and presidents, &quot;but this was the man who took my breath away&quot;.

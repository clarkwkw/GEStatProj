    "text": "   Ubaid Ahmad Photograph: Ubaid Ahmad    I have been working here since 2001. In Kabul, we run a safe house where women who are at risk of violence are given food, clothing, shelter, education and vocational training. Hawca is getting ready to open two shelters in other parts of Afghanistan. Here in Kabul, we also run a legal aid centre for women who have been victims of violence. Kabul is just an island in Afghanistan. If you travel 25km outside Kabul, life is totally different. There are no schools for women, and women are not allowed to go to health clinics. Outside Kabul, we are working with communities to establish women&apos;s groups. These groups talk about women&apos;s rights, about children&apos;s rights, about the legal system of Afghanistan. Whenever the women face any violence, the leaders of those groups tell them how they should react and where they can go to find support. There are lots of groups and parties that are against women&apos;s rights in this country. So, because we at Hawca are working to promote women&apos;s rights, we are a target for them. This is one of the biggest obstacles we are facing. I have never personally been threatened, but some of my colleagues have been beaten and others have received death threats. We even face problems with people at some of the government ministries. Not necessarily at the ministry of women&apos;s affairs, but at some of the other ministries. When we talk to them about the shelter, they don&apos;t look at us with a good eye. They say the women are prostitutes and that the safe house is a brothel. We have faced pressure from many people who want our shelter to be closed. After the foreign governments and troops leave Afghanistan at the end of next year, we fear that aid funding will also drop. This would have a negative impact on our projects. If world leaders want to do something to help end violence against women, I think they can do a lot. But I&apos;m not sure they have the motivation. I don&apos;t think these big meetings like the [UN] Commission on the Status of Women can achieve very much when it comes to practical things, but on the other hand these meetings can put pressure on governments. I think the meetings are important because they are a form of advocacy for women&apos;s rights.",

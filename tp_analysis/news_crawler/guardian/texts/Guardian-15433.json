    "text": "Research by Global Witness revealing the murky world of land investments is a timely reminder for G8 leaders when they meet next month in Northern Ireland (Top bank accused of bankrolling land invasion for rubber, 13 May). For too long, land investments have remained dangerously unregulated and opaque, exposing poor communities to having their homes grabbed from beneath their feet, including the land they rely on for food to eat and from which they make a living. Globally, the amount of land that has been sold or leased over the past decade could feed 1 billion people. As host of the G8 summit, the UK government says it wants to begin tackling global hunger and clamp down on land grabs. A significant step towardsthis would be improving transparency of investments to shine a light on secretive land deals and to ensure that the interests of affected communities are upheld.Ben PhillipsCampaigns director, Oxfam",

    "text": "Guy Fawkes night is unique in the air pollution calendar. The smoke from bonfires takes us back to a time when our homes were heated with solid fuel, and the smoke from fireworks also contains tiny inhalable particles of metals that are used to make different colours. These include red (strontium), green (barium), blue (copper), silver (aluminium and titanium), purple (copper and strontium) and gold (iron). This year still cold, settled weather allowed fireworks and bonfire smoke to build up in towns and cities across England and Wales. The north-west of England was the worst affected with pollution in Blackpool, Liverpool, Warrington and Wigan reaching the maximum value of 10, or very high, according to the UK daily air quality index. The Guy Fawkes air pollution experienced by people in Liverpool in 24 hours was equivalent to five days&apos; normal exposure. Two weeks earlier settled weather conditions allowed air pollution from a wide area of Europe to accumulate over northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, East Anglia and south-east England as far as Norwich, Reading and Portsmouth. It was possible to detect different pollution sources. Air arriving in the capital on 23 October had drifted over France, Germany and the Netherlands for the previous three days and was dominated by road transport pollution, whereas air that reached London on the 24th came from Poland across Germany and was rich in pollution from coal burning.",

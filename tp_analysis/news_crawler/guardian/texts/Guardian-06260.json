    "text": "One of the coalition&apos;s flagship free schools has just 37 applications for children to start this September, despite originally planning to open with places for more than 300. The Beccles free school in Suffolk, a secondary school for children aged 11 to 16, is due to open with three year groups this autumn. In one year group, just 10 children have applied to join. The school&apos;s backers, the Seckford Foundation, originally planned to open on a site with capacity for 300 pupils but scaled back to 162 children after moving to a temporary site this year. The school is due to move to bigger premises next to an existing comprehensive school, Sir John Leman high school, from 2014. Jeremy Rowe, the headteacher of Sir John Leman high, said: &quot;There&apos;s a really good choice already of good and outstanding schools. People have not been persuaded by the free school. They have voted with their feet and their hearts for a good comprehensive school that has served them for years.&quot; The headteacher said the plan to open a new school next to his own made no economic or educational sense, as it could only flourish by taking pupils and diverting funding from the existing one. &quot;If this school ever moves, we will be the only town in the country with a population of 9,000 and two secondary schools. You can only grow at the expense of another school so it means we will have to cut what we offer  cut courses, cut opportunities and pastoral care.&quot; Free schools, which are state-funded but independently run, were a key Conservative policy at the last election. Michael Gove, the education secretary, once spoke of a &quot;superb new school in every community&quot; but ambitions have been scaled back by a lack of cash and fear of failure. A total of 24 free schools opened last September, including one in west London where the journalist Toby Young is chair of governors, but officials expect just 50 more to open this September. The Beccles free school will receive funding from the Department for Education (DfE) to cover the costs of its planned admissions number, rather than those who actually enrol. In common with other new state schools, it will also receive cash to cover start-up costs such as buying books and equipment. The department says any excess per-pupil funding will be recouped if actual enrolment numbers are lower than planned. Rowe criticised the expense of converting a former infants&apos; school as a temporary site for the free school. &quot;They&apos;re converting an infants&apos; school into a secondary school, installing a state-of-the-art kitchen and science labs, knocking through walls. Its economically abhorrent.&quot; Opponents of the school say 3,000 parents signed a petition against it. A public consultation, published in March, found that just 21 local parents supported the school out of 142 people who replied. The consultation report noted that: &quot;Anti-free school campaigners were active at each of the public consultations and approached members of the public. This may have impacted engagement and influenced opinion.&quot; The foundation backing the school also runs the private Woodbridge school in Suffolk, and is behind another free school in the county, the Saxmundham free school, which is due to open in September. Christine Blower, the general secretary of the NUT, said: &quot;There was clearly no appetite for this school yet Michael Gove pressed ahead with it regardless. The number of pupils taking up places at the free school demonstrates the total lack of interest in a school which was neither wanted, nor needed in the area.&quot; &quot;The government&apos;s free school policy is a dreadful waste of public money. They are being opened up at vast expense to the taxpayer to serve tiny numbers of pupils when other schools are being starved of funds.&quot; A DfE spokesman said: &quot;We have signed a funding agreement for the Beccles free school, and it has been approved to open in September. We expect pupil recruitment to increase steadily now parents have certainty that the school will open later this year. &quot;Standards in Suffolk have been below the national average for the last four years. The establishment of this free school will drive up standards and provide greater opportunity and choice for parents and pupils.&quot; Graham Watson, the director of the Seckford Foundation, said that moving a child to a new school was a &quot;significant decision&quot; and only one month has passed since the school was approved by the DfE. &quot;However, we have had 106 expressions of interest from parents. We expect pupil numbers to increase steadily over the next couple of months as parents are reassured that the school will open.&quot;",

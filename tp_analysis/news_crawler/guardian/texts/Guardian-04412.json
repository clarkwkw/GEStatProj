    "text": "We all have fond memories of taking a few lazy months off after the stress of A-levels. As we draw to the end of an academically and socially packed year, the idea of doing the same again is appealing. But after graduation, there&apos;ll be few occasions when we can enjoy such extended holidays, free to do as we wish. So now that summer has arrived, let&apos;s take full advantage. It goes without saying that summer vacations are the perfect time to go travelling, especially if you avoid the pricey school holiday period. As clichd as it has become, inter-railing is a fantastic experience which can be done relatively affordably and easily  although you&apos;re more likely to meet backpacking students than locals. Tickets go up considerably when you turn 26, so make the most of cheaper rates while you&apos;re eligible. Overseas volunteering won&apos;t amaze future employers with its originality, but it can be very rewarding. Finding a reputable company that won&apos;t rip you off is crucial, as is discovering a programme that appeals to your own interests. There are plenty of websites where you can see other people&apos;s recommendations. Of course for most of us, money is tight  but to avoid overspending you can combine employment and adventure. Hannah Warn, a psychology student at the University of Winchester, is spending her summer at Camp America, an increasingly popular venture where British students live and work on an summer camp. &quot;Being thrown into something where I don&apos;t really know what to expect is exciting,&quot; she says. &quot;It gives me a chance to experience being away from home in a different way to just being a few hours away at uni.&quot; Those with a talent for languages might also consider working abroad as an au pair. The work may be challenging, but it&apos;s a chance to immerse yourself in a new culture while your employer foots most of the bill. For non-linguists, some universities offer travel grants  and in many cases your summer plans need be only loosely related to your studies, so it&apos;s worth researching what&apos;s available. There are worse ways to spend your summer than going on a free &quot;research&quot; trip to Venice. And, we know it already, but if you have an idea about the sort of career you&apos;d like, getting work experience is wise. In many careers, graduating with only your degree to show for your three or four years just won&apos;t cut it. Send applications off early and to as many places as possible. Make sure you take a well-earned break this summer but you&apos;ll be glad later if that&apos;s not all you do.",

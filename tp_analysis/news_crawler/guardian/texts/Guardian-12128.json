This world is really big  about ten times as wide as our world  and most of it is thick air pulled tight together. It has big beautiful rings around it, made of many pieces of ice.&quot; Every person who uses  jargon  annoying words  from  civil servants important people to  management consultants rich silly bossy powerful  people with confusing jobs  should try it.

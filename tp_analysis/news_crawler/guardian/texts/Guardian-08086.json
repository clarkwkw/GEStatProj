    "text": "I have to confess, not having a GCSE in GCSE marking, that I&apos;m hazy on the details of how modules are marked, how exams are marked, and how the whole lot is then collated into a single grade. But it seems pretty complicated. It seems that one of the basic problems here is a failure to decide whether the results are meant to be a certificate of skills mastered or simply a guide to where, exactly, an individual student lies in a competitive league of competence for that year. This year&apos;s debacle over English grades seems to stem from a desire to ensure that a certain number of pupils get certain results, which speaks more of an inability to set papers consistently year after year than it does anything else. It also, surely, makes GCSE grades a comparative index rather than a concrete indication of knowledge or skill. The sensible thing, surely, would be for GCSEs to be a guarantee of a certain level of capability, a reliable statement of actual achievement thus far. Any emphasis on sorting out relative academic potential ought to be the job ofthe more advanced examinations a student chooses to tackle. It seems plain that different examinations have different practical applications in the post-school world, and that this isn&apos;t being fully addressed in eithertheir setting or their grading.",

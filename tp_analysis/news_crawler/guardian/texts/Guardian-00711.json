The US attorneys office in San Francisco announced Friday that a grand jury indicted 29-year-old Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, of Moscow, Russia, a day earlier on charges including computer intrusion and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors say Nikulin used a LinkedIn employees credentials to access the companys computers in 2012. Nikulin is also accused of hacking two other companies, Dropbox and Formspring, and conspiring to sell stolen user names, passwords and email addresses of Formspring customers. He was arrested on 5 October by officials in the Czech Republic and remains there, according to prosecutors. Russian officials have said they are working to prevent his extradition to the United States.   Related: Hacker advertises details of 117 million LinkedIn users on darknet    LinkedIn has suggested that Nikulins arrest was tied to a 2012 breach of member information. In May, LinkedIn said the 2012 breach resulted in more than 100 million of its users passwords being compromised, vastly more than had been previously thought.  Abraham Simmons, a spokesman for the US attorneys office, declined to comment on whether the charges against Nikulin related to that breach.  Simmons said he did not know the name of Nikulins attorney.  LinkedIn said in a statement that it appreciated the FBIs ongoing work to pursue those responsible for the 2012 breach of LinkedIn member information.  The indictment alleges three unnamed co-conspirators, one of whom offered to sell the stolen Formspring user information to another for 5,500, or about $6,000 in current US currency. The US has accused Russia of coordinating the theft and disclosure of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other institutions and individuals in the US to influence the outcome of the election. Russia has denied that.  There was no indication the LinkedIn case was connected to that accusation. ",

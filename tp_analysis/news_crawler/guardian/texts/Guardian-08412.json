    "text": "My father&apos;s elderly Windows XP laptop needs replacing. Its hinges are damaged, the case is cracked, the power connector makes poor contact, the battery lasts almost no time at all, and a couple of the key tops are missing. The trouble is, he doesn&apos;t want to change to Windows 7 as he is easily exasperated when he can&apos;t do what he wants. He has used my Windows 7 machine once or twice, under duress, and was frustrated with it. He can see no advantage to switching to Windows 7, other than changing his machine. His uses are quite mundane  word processing, web, iPlayer and family photos  and it really is used as a laptop: ie, on his lap on a couch. Any thoughts?SotiresMost people who have been using computers for two or three decades have already made larger jumps than the step from Windows XP to Windows 7, which actually requires very little relearning. Your father may have progressed from, for example, a Sinclair Spectrum or Acorn BBC Micro to an Amstrad PCW or to a PC running Microsoft&apos;s MS DOS. Even people who have only used Microsoft Windows have seen significant shifts from Windows 3 to Windows 95 (DOS-based) to Windows 2000 and XP (NT-based). Experience shows that it&apos;s foolish to try to hang on to the past. Even if you don&apos;t want to be an early adopter, you still have to keep moving. In fact, sensible people moved from XP to Windows 7 as quickly as possible. This gave them up to eight years on XP (2001-09) followed by at least six years on Windows 7 (2009-15). As it is, your father has missed the advantages of having Windows 7&apos;s increased 64-bit power, greater stability, greater security, much better software for web browsing, email and photos (in Windows Live Essentials), and generally smoother operation for the past three years. And by the time he upgrades, Windows 7 may already have been replaced by Windows 8, which is a much bigger jump than the one he faces now. You can, of course, still buy laptops running XP. These may be second hand, refurbished, or new, but they all suffer from the drawbacks of old hardware. These include much slower processors, too little memory (typically 1GB; rarely 2GB) and tidgy hard drives. Windows XP officially (not literally) was taken off the market on 30 June 2008, so most of these old laptops will be at least five years old. Hardware has advanced on a lot since then, and so has almost everything else. Today&apos;s websites, photos and movies are much bigger than they used to be, and you need a lot more processing power to handle them. I did a bit of online window shopping for XP laptops, and I couldn&apos;t find anything worth buying at a decent price. Yes, there&apos;s plenty of junk in the 100-175 range, but prices of sturdy and reasonably quick XP laptops  ones that look likely to survive another two or three years  are not that much cheaper than new ones. Meanwhile, prices of new XP laptops can be higher than Windows 7 machines. You can even find them in the 600 to 1,500 range, which is crazy. You might find a good second-hand XP laptop locally, but be prepared to haggle over the price. People who paid 1,000 or 1,500 for their old laptop may not appreciate that far better machines are now available brand new for 250 to 300, complete with a guarantee. Even if you can pick up a good laptop for 100-150, you may have to install extra memory to reach the minimum 2GB, and the battery will be shot. Worse, you won&apos;t know whether or not the hard drive is in good condition, or whether it&apos;s riddled with viruses, or spyware. I certainly wouldn&apos;t buy any XP laptop unless it came with the correct Windows system disc or an intact recovery partition that can be used to restore the operating software to its factory condition. It must also have a legible Windows COA (Certificate of Authenticity) sticker. If you take the second-hand route, aim for a name brand (IBM, Toshiba, Dell etc) business machine with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor from the T or P series, as these tend to be reasonably nippy. Bigger numbers are usually better, and the 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo P8600 Processor used in laptops like the ThinkPad X200 still has legs. In fact, your dad could get a P8600 in a new Dell Latitude E6400 running XP for only 578.99 from Play.com. However, he could also get a slimline Core i5-powered Ultrabook for that price. XP on Windows 7     Windows 7    There are another two options that you could discuss with your dad, if he&apos;s willing to bend just a bit. These are to run Windows XP on a new 64-bit Windows 7 laptop, or to make Windows 7 look and (up to a point) work like XP. Unfortunately, both of these need quite a bit of geekery. Like your dad, some slow-moving organisations wanted to stay with Windows XP as long as possible, so Microsoft gave them the option to run a free copy of XP under Windows 7. This requires the use of Windows 7 Professional, not the home version, and a computer with hardware virtualisation technology built into the processor. You will have to check the chip to make sure it offers Intel&apos;s VT feature. This means looking it up in the Ark at ark.intel.com. With the right kit, go to Microsoft.com and download and install a VM (virtual machine) in Windows 7, then download and install Windows XP in this virtual PC. Windows Secrets and other sites have guides online. It is much cheaper to use the VM than to buy and install a retail copy of Windows XP to replace Windows 7. (The copies of Windows that manufacturers ship with laptops are bought under cheap deals that tie them to the machine on which they are shipped. Your dad can&apos;t transfer the copy from his old laptop. Retail copies, which are sold and supported by Microsoft, can be moved.) But perhaps the best idea is to buy a new laptop running Windows 7 and adjust the settings so it looks quite a lot like Windows XP. As always, increasing the resemblance requires an increasing amount of work, but you can start with the simplest option. The next time your dad uses his guest account on your Windows 7 laptop, right-click on the desktop, select Personalize from the bottom of the menu, and select Windows Classic from the set of Basic and High Contrast Themes. This makes Windows 7 look a lot like Windows 98/2000, not like XP, but it could suit your father. (Microsoft provided exactly the same Classic theme in XP to help businesses to adopt it. At the time, people were complaining about having to move to XP, just as they are now complaining about having to move off it. I expect they&apos;re the same people.) You can try this yourself. You probably won&apos;t like the Windows Classic theme, but you can always switch back to your preferred theme. To make this simpler, save your current theme under a new name and it will appear in the My Themes section. If Classic isn&apos;t enough, XP-lovers can download and install an unofficial clone of Microsoft&apos;s Luna theme (used in XP) on Windows 7. Since this is not Microsoft signed code, you will also have to install a a theme patcher as well. To simplify things, someone has put together a 9.4MB 7_to_XP_pack.rar file that contains many of these files. (You will need WINrar to unpack it.) There are lots of YouTube videos that show you how to do it, and this is one of the least bad examples. To make Windows 7 work a bit more like XP, not just look the part, you can also install the Classic Shell or CSMenu to bring back the old Start menu. Windows XP proved this worked badly, because it&apos;s hard to find anything in dozens of randomly arranged nested menus, and nobody can be bothered to sort them into a proper structure. Vista and Windows 7, by contrast, are search-driven operating systems: you find programs by typing a few letters into the menu&apos;s search/run box. (XP users can get the same kind of feature by installing Launchy.) Most of these changes downgrade Windows 7, so they are only for cranky users. However, one that will appeal to most new Windows 7 users is to show hierarchical folder views. To do this, go to Windows Explorer&apos;s Tools menu, open the Folder Options property sheet, and click the two check boxes marked &quot;Show all folders&quot; and &quot;Automatically expand to current folder&quot;. To be frank, doing all this involves more time and effort than simply accepting Windows 7 and doing the small amount of relearning required. Perhaps you could convert your dad to this point of view by showing him how to use the menu&apos;s search/run box. There must be several things your dad doesn&apos;t know how to do in Windows XP, so get him to search for one of those in Windows 7. If not, just type in the word &quot;change&quot; and pick an option. Windows 7 provides lots of help and hand-holding, and again, it&apos;s usually quicker and easier just to tell Windows 7 what you want than to find it in Windows XP. Windows 7 is, as mentioned, search-driven rather than menu-driven, and it doesn&apos;t require you to remember where to find all those minor adjustments that you hardly ever use. This is also true of the web. It&apos;s hard to let go of outmoded paradigms, but if your dad plans to outlive Windows 9 (2015), Windows 10 (2018), Windows 11 (2021) and so on, he should start moving now.",

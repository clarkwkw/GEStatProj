Click here to view Although notionally about General Patton, the maximum number of units you command in History: Legends Of War is eight, a job Patton would have regarded with disdain if not active embarrassment. Lightly bending history to meet the demands of the game, you&apos;ll fight your way through France to Belgium, earning prestige points to recruit new units and upgrading Patton&apos;s skills as you go. Battles are fun if not especially involving, with the game loving a good tank ambush, while your troops utter grating vocal samples. Grenade arcs show a clear path to the enemy, while in fact deflecting off walls to injure your redoubtable yet idiotic troops; enemy soldiers survive direct hits from tank shells by crouching behind wooden fencing; and there are other head-shaking inconsistencies, but those not expecting Advance Wars will find some satisfaction in this second world war pastiche.",

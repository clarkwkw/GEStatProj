    "text": "For Alan Titchmarsh, it&apos;s the Surrey Hills, whose flora and fauna makes it &quot;a unique and valuable natural resource well worth treasuring.&quot; For me, it&apos;s the escape offered by the South Downs in one of the most crowded parts of the country, recognised by the creation of the country&apos;s newest national park in the area last year. But what do you love about England&apos;s national parks and AONBs? That&apos;s the question being posed by a new campaign launched today by the government&apos;s Our Land project.  Share your favourites below, and if you have photographs and video, you can add them to Our Land&apos;s Facebook page.",

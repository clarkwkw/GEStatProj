    "text": "Although second world war analogies have been rather overused in our collective response to climate change, I have a card of a wartime poster which asks &quot;Can I do without it?&quot; This simple, anti-consumerist message (less shopping meant more shipping) is a nutshell response to many of the challenges that face us  not just as a rejection of &quot;buying our way out of recession&quot;, but also as an encapsulation of the fact that sometimes less really is more. I contend that if we all did a bit less  work, travel, shopping  we&apos;d help the planet a lot. My grandmother, Ann Baer, is a woman who, as far as I am aware, has never thrown out so much as a jam jar in her life. Her washing up gloves have second, third, fourth lives as elastic bands. Pieces of string, ribbons, and paper all find useful new roles long after their first job has been long forgotten. Food not eaten re-appears the next day in a new guise (and often with a highly inventive name). For her, this is not some showy, fashionable &quot;new austerity&quot; agenda  it is simply a mindful way of using things until they literally fall apart. This embracing of the lifecycle rather than the replacement of things is imaginative, creative and thoughtful. It is not a denial of needing stuff, but rather a reinvention of original purpose which invests the everyday with its own peculiar histories. I&apos;d like a collective action which shared creative responses to how we reinvent things together. This could stretch from pieces of string and packaging waste, to big projects involving disused buildings and vacant land lots. To which, the response would sometimes aptly be to do nothing at all.

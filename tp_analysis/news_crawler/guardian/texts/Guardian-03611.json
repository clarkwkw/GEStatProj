    "text": "The Guardian&apos;s Open 20 was compiled by asking a simple question  who are the people, in your view, who&apos;ve had the most impact on the open internet? Journalists, activists, hackers and others, some high-profile and some not were asked, and the resulting list of very different characters was whittled down to a list of 20. How can you compare a evangeliser, to a hacktivist, to the founder of a multi-billion dollar business in a systematic way? In short, you can&apos;t. We hope the list reflects the diverse nature of the open net, the different ideas of what the open net is, and the different ways in which people contribute to it. But more than anything else - it&apos;s the start of a discussion. There&apos;s thousands of great people not on our list. And that&apos;s just the ones we know about.  Read the open 20 list and tell us whose contribution to the net you would not be able to live without. Who&apos;s sticking it to censorship, snooping, or walled gardens? Which &apos;villain&apos; can&apos;t be ignored?  Let us know by leaving a comment in the thread below with your nomination for a readers&apos; alternative to the Guardian Open 20 and explain why you&apos;ve chosen that individual. They can be living or dead, but you should tell us what is they have done or are doing that makes them stand out to you. Comments on this thread will close at 9am (BST) on Monday 23 April. Our editorial team will then select the best suggestions and most well-argued nominees and open it to your vote.",

    "text": "The government&apos;s July 2011 Open Public Services white paper promises that &quot;many part-time students will be able to get tuition loans for the first time&quot;. In theory this will help them cover the average tuition fee cost per year of about 8,700; with 75% of universities opting to charge the top whack of 9,000. But let&apos;s step back for a moment to discover the experience of the 40% of UK students that currently study part-time. All of my teaching at the University of Gloucestershire  in community engagement and governance (or localism and big society in current government-speak)  is delivered primarily via the internet, to mature part-timers, studying at a distance from our campuses. We have trained more than 1,000 graduates to date, and they tend to go into community-based work for the police, voluntary bodies and local authorities. Students mainly come from across England and Wales, but have included notable outliers in Lossiemouth in Scotland, and the Bolivian jungle. To gain an honours degree these part-time students typically balance looking after dependents, home life, a day job, and studying for six years. It&apos;s an incredible feat of determination, endurance, blood, sweat, tears and triumph. So why do they do it? Bruce Poole, president of the Society of Local Council Clerks and a 2010 graduate felt his degree was worth it: &quot;My councillors look at me in a different light, and realise my professionalism.&quot; There is also the &quot;trick&quot; of ensuring that assignments for academic credit also enable students to deal with live issues in the workplace. Examples of &quot;killing two birds&quot; include: assembling a neighbourhood plan in line with the government&apos;s &quot;big society agenda&quot;, working up a resource plan for an intergenerational community garden project in Gateshead; improving a Hampshire community centre and addressing a &quot;wicked problem&quot; in the form of bringing an old gas works back into community use. Dom Stapleton, Didcot town clerk, and a 2011 graduate, turned in a first-class dissertation entitled The Role of Political Parties in Parish and Town Councils. He concluded that: &quot;In 1991, 10% of parish and town councils had councillors who declared political affiliation. In 2011 this figure has increased to 48%, and rose to 98% of councils with populations over 20,000.&quot; Dom&apos;s study, and several others, featured in a recent professional conference on localism and the big society. In a second extended study, entitled The Big Society in Gloucestershire in the Context of Public Sector Cuts, Jason Dunsford, who works for a voluntary organisation, found that &quot;half of respondents had seen a loss in funding this year totalling 2.6m, which is 20% of their total funding&quot;, while 35% had to make redundancies &quot;and a third have had to close down a wide range of services&quot;. Again, this research towards a qualification has also been widely disseminated to practitioners. And rightly so. I strongly believe that a crucial gain from this type of study comes from the relationships built up by students and graduates coming from very different backgrounds: police community support officers mix with community development workers, local politicians and paid officers. It&apos;s a rich mix that extends horizons and career possibilities. Richard Branson recently urged universities to operate &quot;accelerated university degree courses&quot;, which I think is what we&apos;re already doing. In many ways this emphasis on learning within a community setting is a very traditional one. Take a look at the American educationalist John Dewey, for example, quoted in 1900: &quot;[learning] shall be made a genuine form of active community life, instead of a place set apart in which to learn lessons&quot;. Of course how students from hereon will feel when confronted with a hike in tuition fees is another matter; I personally am shocked that coalition partners have shunted through debt that graduates will only likely clear aged 51. Not to mention additional costs such as deposit payments on a house. Many of my students missed out on formal qualifications; the youngest is in her 20s while the oldest are well in to claiming bus passes. Part-timers really do demonstrate how learning is for life in every sense.

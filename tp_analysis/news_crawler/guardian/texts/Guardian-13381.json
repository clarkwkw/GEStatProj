    "headline": "What next for Syria's refugees? Live panel discussion", 
    "text": "On Wednesday the UN refugee agency UNHCR announced that 1 million refugees have crossed Syrian borders. These are staggering numbers, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled Syria but have not been registered as refugees, and the millions of internally displaced people with the country. We have convened a panel to discuss the situation and what needs to happen next. What is life like in the camps? What are the biggest challenges facing the humanitarian response? Which groups are most vulnerable? How are neighbouring countries coping? Panellists will be online today between 1pm and 2.30pm GMT (3pm in Damascus, 8am in New York). Please leave your questions and comments in the thread below. You can also contribute on Twitter using the hashtag #syriarefugee. If you have any problems posting a comment, or would prefer to comment anonymously, email us at development@guardian.co.uk and we&apos;ll add your views. The panel Sanj Srikanthan, emergency field director, International Rescue Committee  The scale of the suffering is staggering. Even before the recent upsurge, the infrastructure of neighbouring countries has struggled to meet demand on resources. Images of refugee camps dominate the news, yet the majority of Syrian refugees have fled to cities, towns and villages. These &quot;urban refugees&quot; are hidden from view, packed into small flats without money to pay for rent, heat, food, medical care. It is vital that the aid reaches those most in need, including inside Syria and the estimated eight million people living in Free Syrian Army controlled areas. The funding that has been pledged will only last until this summer.  Daryl Grisgraber, senior advocate, Refugees International  One of the first things I saw upon entering Domiz  the camp for Syrian refugees in northern Iraq  was a registration area filled with hundreds of people. Small children sat on piles of bags while their parents lined up nearby to fill out forms and speak to camp staff. Staff were working at full throttle to move individuals through and get them the care they needed, but the huge number crossing the border every day is overwhelming  both for aid workers and local Iraqi authorities. One volunteer told us that some refugees who arrived a month ago still had no tents, and that others still did not know the camp&apos;s medical clinic even existed.   Karen Leigh, managing editor, Syria Deeply  Atmeh, just inside the Syrian border, is commonly known as the olive tree camp. Food is scarce, temperatures have dropped, and good news and cheer are anything but plentiful. News Deeply teams have made trips to the Zaatari refugee camp, on the Jordan-Syria border, and to Atmeh. We&apos;ve found that women  vulnerable to rape, pregnancy, bride price and harsh physical conditions  are a surprisingly overlooked at-risk group. In our work, we&apos;ve brought individual female voices from the camps to the frontlines of our coverage of the country&apos;s humanitarian crisis.   Reem Alsalem, UNHCR bureau for Middle East and north Africa  Though access to basic services are provided at the camp in Jordan, the sheer numbers have increased the pressure. UNHCR and the Jordanian government are working quickly on expanding the camp and there are also efforts under way to erect a new camp. Life in the camp is not comfortable, as it is an arid and desert area. Many have chosen to leave.  Neighbouring countries and communities have shown extraordinary generosity, keeping their borders largely open. International solidarity must be urgently reinforced to these countries and to humanitarian organisations working on the ground, to enable them to respond to their critical and most basic needs.  Kassia Queen, head of mission, Mdecins sans Frontires  I have just returned from managing MSF&apos;s operations in an area of northern Syria. Our team was working in a former farm in the north west of the country, that we converted into a makeshift hospital with an operating theatre, an A&amp;E department, post-operative care services and an out-patient department. We also have services for pregnant women and some mental health support. When possible, at least once a week, our mobile clinic teams go out into the surrounding country to provide healthcare to residents in small towns and villages.  Other panellists Joining the discussion will be Samina Haq, programme manager for Islamic Relief UK; Frank McManus, global humanitarian adviser for Goal, who has recently returned from five months of organising programmes in the Idlib governorate of northern Syria, and Erin Weir, protection and advocacy adviser for the Middle East at the Norwegian Refugee Council based in Amman, Jordan. Iman Morooka, communications specialist for Unicef, will join the panel live from Damascus alongside Juliette Touma from the Middle East and north Africa office in Amman. Panel highlights  From DGrisgraber:  The ideal humanitarian response employs people on the ground who are familiar with the needs, culture, language of the population being served  In cases like Syria, such recruiting may go on rather quietly to guard the safety of individuals.  From Citizen181:  What we also know, and they seem to have been forgotten  is the 1 million refugees from the Iraq conflict who where being hosted in Syria.  From SanjSrikanthan:  Aid should focus on where Syrians are living  and 75% of the 1m refugees in the region who live in urban environments and not camps. They are not as visible but their needs are acute.    From KassiaQueenMSF:  There is an urgent need for independent humanitarian aid to reach the people  the health system has collapsed. Men, woman and children are trying to survive living amongst the violence and with limited possibilities to receive healthcare.  ",

    "text": "The real challenge, the true satisfaction of Football Manager (and Championship Manager before it) is nothing to do with Chelsea or Manchester United. It is not about maintaining the dominance of a major Premiership side. It is about taking a tiny minnow from the bottom of the FA pyramid to the very heights of European success. Until you have lead Dagenham &amp; Redbridge to a Champions League final against Milan you haven&apos;t truly played the game. With that in mind, our final selection of Football Manager 13 transfer targets is for those brave souls operating at League Two and non-league levels. Once again, Sports Interactive&apos;s own football analyst Tom Davidson has done the scouting, and any of these 10 professionals will lift your side on those cold away fixtures in York.  League Two/Non-League Jason Banton (attacking midfielder (right/left)&quot;Banton has played at youth level for teams such as Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool and has still got some decent stats that should make him a good winger in the future.&quot;Transfer fee: 0Wage demands: 650-1.3k per week. Francis Jeffers (striker)&quot;Everyone remembers when Jeffers was meant to be England&apos;s next great striker after his 8m move to Arsenal at the turn of the millennium. Sadly, his career didn&apos;t quite pan out as planned but he is still a very good striker and would be an absolutely brilliant signing at League Two level.&quot;Transfer fee: 0Wage demands: 1.8k-3k per week. Neil Etheridge (goalkeeper, Fulham)&quot;Etheridge has the potential to be a very good Football League goalkeeper and you should look to get him in early to maximise his potential. He&apos;d be a sound choice between the sticks in League Two.&quot;Transfer fee: 12-20kWage demands: 1k-1.9k per week. Steven Old (centre-back)At non-league level you&apos;re going to have to be very clever when it comes to managing your budget. Old will help you do that: he&apos;s in his peak years, fairly cheap wage demands and good all-round stats. You won&apos;t be able to find a better centre-back at this level.Transfer fee: 0Wage demands: 1k-2k per week. Vincent Pricard (striker)&quot;Pricard had extended spells at Portsmouth and Stoke in the last 10 years ,but is still under 30 years old. His high heading and strength stats make him the perfect target man at this level.&quot;Transfer fee: 0Wage demands: 700-1.5k per week. Romone Rose (striker, attacking midfielder (right, left))&quot;Rose is a 22-year-old striker with good pace and finishing stats that should put him ahead of the competition in the Blue Square Premier. His wage demands are cheap so there is no reason to turn him down.&quot;Transfer fee: 0Wage demands: 825-1.4k per week. Chris Hall (striker)&quot;Hall has good attributes for a striker at this level and shouldn&apos;t stretch the wage budget too much. He&apos;d make a very good signing for any Blue Square North/South club.&quot;Transfer fee: 0Wage demands: 325-550 per week Luke Holden (attacking midfielder (left))&quot;Holden has a lot to offer Blue Square North/South teams; he couples decent acceleration and agility with good crossing and dribbling ability. He also has respectable creativity which is relatively rare at this level and should do well in the Blue Square Premier too.&quot;Transfer fee: 0Wage demands: 230-400 per week. Jordan Watson (left-back)&quot;If you are a Blue Square North/South club and are lucky enough to have a bit of money to spend then Watson is the player for you. A promising young left-back with great pace who should be your starting left-back all the way into League Two.&quot;Transfer fee: 3-7kWage demands: 350-600 per week. Stephen Darville (right-back)&quot;Sticking with the full-back positions, Darville would be a very good signing for any Blue Square North/South team in need of a right-back. His acceleration and natural fitness lend well to his attacking forays up the pitch and a good crossing stat means that he&apos;ll be pretty useful when he gets up there.&quot;Transfer fee: 0Wage demands: 550-1K",

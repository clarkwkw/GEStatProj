    "text": "   Esther Eshiet, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    Rio+20 I believe will make some impact. I&apos;ve been a big supporter of the MDGs [millennium development goals]. It&apos;s a fantastic global roadmap if it&apos;s implemented as it&apos;s meant to be. The follow-up is my concern. I worry that the United Nations cannot hold a government responsible for failing to meet targets. It&apos;s like a toothless bulldog. In Nigeria sustainable development is mixed, it&apos;s a very uneven path. In Cross Rivers [state], we&apos;ve had governors who have chosen to look at sustaining our forests. We have some of the largest forests in west Africa, where forests are being chopped at disastrous rates. We&apos;ve been able to leave a lasting legacy. We used to have horrible rates of HIV infection. We&apos;ve worked hard to [reduce] that to 4.4% today, though there are still issues of accessibility. But we have failed in other ways. These days you don&apos;t even want to think about sending your child to a public school  they&apos;re just empty rooms with teachers who have no clue what to do. We successfully transformed from a military to a democratic government. But under democracy, violence against women has gotten to heart-breaking dimensions. Before [rapes] used to happen in the dark, but now people are going about it and putting it on the internet. Gender ties into all this. If young girls aren&apos;t educated because of poverty, sometimes you can almost map out their lives. They&apos;re sent to chop firewood. They&apos;re too tired to learn properly because they have been working in the fields before even getting to class. Because of poverty, they&apos;re first to be pulled out of school. There&apos;s a high likelihood of them being manipulated, falling pregnant and themselves repeating the poverty cycle. This has an effect on the economy, and on national growth levels and GDP, of course. It&apos;s not just about a failure in our value systems; at the root are our administrations. Our issue is political will. The inconsistencies in government policies have contributed to a backward slide. Between 2000 and 2006 you could virtually see positive changes happening before your eyes. But then a new government policy came in 2007, this seven-point agenda, which changed everything. As individuals and as civil society we can&apos;t do everything. Rwanda and Botswana are examples of how the MDG can be a fantastic development tool. But at the same time I&apos;m so ashamed when I think we call Nigeria the giant of Africa, but a small country like Rwanda has far exceeded us in development goals.",

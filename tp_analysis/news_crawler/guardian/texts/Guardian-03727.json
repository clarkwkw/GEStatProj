    "text": "Japan&apos;s two largest social mobile games firms, GREE and DeNA, have reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2012, although regulatory scrutiny could rein in their growth in the months ahead. GREE generated revenues of $560m (around 348m) during the quarter, posting a net profit of $162m (around 101m). That&apos;s up 182% and 186% respectively year-on-year. The company says it has 234m members worldwide for its social mobile games community, although the bulk of its revenues come from the 30m in Japan. 93% of GREE&apos;s revenues come from in-app purchases, versus 7% for advertising. Meanwhile, DeNA reported revenues of $529m for the first three months of 2012, up 32% year-on-year. Its operating income rose 19% to $234m in the same period. The company has so far made $640m from its Moba-coin virtual currency alone. To put these numbers into perspective, Electronic Arts&apos; latest set of financial results reveal its mobile revenues were $87m in the first quarter of 2012, while its traditional Western rival Gameloft generated $58.9m. Zynga, meanwhile, generated $321m of revenues from its entire business web and mobile in the same quarter. GREE and DeNA are giants in the social mobile gaming world, then, but their revenues and profits remain rooted in their Japanese homeland. Both companies have aggressive global expansion plans though. DeNA launched its Mobage social gaming network in the West in 2011, starting on Android before releasing a few Mobage-enabled games on iOS. Its $403m acquisition of Western firm ngmoco in October 2010 has been at the heart of this, but DeNA has also snapped up indie developers like Rough Cookie, Gameview, Atakama Labs and Astro Ape, while inking partnerships with other Western publishers. For its part, GREE is planning to launch its social platform worldwide by the end of May 2012. It too has been acquiring most recently paying $180m for US developer Funzio, but also ngmoco&apos;s rival OpenFeint for $104m in April 2011. In fact, its financial results reveal more details about Funzio&apos;s business: the company made $12m of revenues from its Modern War and Crime City social mobile games in the first quarter of 2012, then $5m in April alone as it launched a third title, Kingdom Age. With lucrative profits in Japan fuelling this global expansion, the cloud hanging over both GREE and DeNA is fresh regulatory scrutiny on one aspect of their domestic businesses: &quot;Kompu Gacha&quot; games. These are titles where players can enter sweepstakes for prizes if they buy a certain number of virtual items. Following unrest from parents about children&apos;s spending habits as a result of these offers an intriguing mirror of the &quot;bait apps&quot; debate currently causing a rumpus in the US the Japanese government is expected to crack down on their use. Both companies&apos; share prices dived following the first reports of the likely regulation, showing investors&apos; confidence wobbling in their business models. GREE has already said it will stop offering the offending games at the end of May. On one hand, global expansion will reduce GREE and DeNA&apos;s dependence on Kompu Gacha-related revenues. On the other, those games have been the cash cow base for the expansion overseas, so if sales take a hit, their ability to move fast to build their Western businesses against competition from Zynga, EA and others may be restricted.",

    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Revelations is an extended remake of last year&apos;s handheld game, which adds HD textures, new bits of plot, and appearances from series stalwarts Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield. It draws heavily on Resident Evil&apos;s golden era with wood panelling that could be from the original game and a selection of familiar monsters to kill. Sadly, the action feels wooden too, while the dialogue and voice acting are so startlingly poor you wonder whether it&apos;s meant to be a parody. &quot;This is not good,&quot; notes Jill in a tone of voice suggesting she&apos;s found an out-of-date yogurt in the fridge, rather than been assaulted by a seven-foot mutant with a flailing, blood-sucking proboscis for a face.",

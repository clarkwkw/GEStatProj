What trait is that and what effect does it have? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is an adult male striated calamanthus, Calamanthus fuliginosus. This small passerine is a bird in the Acanthizidae family, also known as the Australasian warblers. (Other authorities place them into the family Pardalotidae.) Acanthizidae consists of small- to medium-sized passerines, most of which have somber plumage colours like olive, grey, or brown, although some have patches of bright yellow. This group includes the smallest Australian bird, the weebill, Smicrornis brevirostris. All have short rounded wings, slender bills, long legs, and short tails. Many acanthizids relatively long-lived, with many species living to over ten years of age in the wild. This life history trait may be the reason that many of these species tend to lay only one or two eggs per clutch.  Striated calamanthus have sandy-coloured upperparts and creamy yellow underparts with black streaks over most of the body. The tail is usually cocked up, and it has a whitish tip. Sexes look almost identical except the male has a white streak above his eyes, and white lores and throat, whereas these areas are sandy-brown in the female.  Striated calamanthus can be confused with a number of other streaked shrub- and ground-dwelling species, such as little grassbird, chestnut-rumped heathwren and Australian pipit, although the combination of habitat, plumage, song and behaviour distinguish these species.  Striated calamanthus are surprisingly little-studied birds. Currently, they are thought to form a superspecies with the rufous fieldwren, C. campestris, and the western fieldwren, C. montanellus.  Striated calamanthus are found in coastal heaths, in saltmarsh areas where there are sedges and reeds, tussock fields and shrubby areas in southeastern New South Wales, southern Victoria and in southeastern South Australia and Tasmania. They forage in the brush and on the ground for insects and seeds. During breeding season, they become quite obvious, singing from the tops of reeds. These small birds construct a domed nest on the ground that is hidden under shrubs or tussocks.

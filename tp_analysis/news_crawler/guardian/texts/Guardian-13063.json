    "text": "With schools increasingly finding practical experiments expensive to run and difficult to assess, university students, it seems, are losing the chance to develop their lab skills to the level required by higher education science programmes.  The problem, recalls Bristol University head of chemistry, professor Nick Norman, &quot;seemed to be the amount of information we were expecting them to absorb and apply in the laboratory. When faced with cognitive overload, many students resorted to blindly following the printed instructions which resulted in a lack of engagement.&quot; However, instead of dumbing down the experimental element of science courses in response, course leaders decided to find a way for students to skill up quickly in each lab method required as they progressed through their degree.  Working with partners including Bristol ChemLabS, AIMS/eBiolabs and a local e-learning company, scientists designed an online facility known as the Dynamic Laboratory Manuals: these contain videos and fully interactive simulations of every technique and piece of apparatus that a science student will use. Piloted in 2007, by this academic year around 1500 students will be logging on to practice key elements of their lab experiments before they ever pick up a pipette - and it&apos;s not just Bristol undergraduates who can benefit.  The A-level chemistry curriculum is now supported in a similar way through a commercial spin-off called LabSkills: there are plans to market higher education versions of the package to other universities globally, and dynamic learning manuals are currently in development for other science subjects including biology and physics.",

The phones also enable the women to buy bigger plots of land, sell more vegetables, save money, and make improvements to their homes. Before the project, women weren't in a level position with the men in relation to selling their crops and seeking better prices Photograph: Simon Rawles/Oxfam       The phones aren't just used to receive information; they are also used to call traders, to arrange collections of produce, and to call doctors when children are sick. The phones have also been used to report domestic violencePhotograph: Simon Rawles       Prang Somun, front centre, is a single parent living with her mother and children. Although she doesn't have her own pink phone, she has access to one when she needs it. All of the community use the phone of her her sister-in-law, Chum Kor, front left, to call a doctor or the police if they need to.

With the money she has saved, she is able to send her daughter to school. The benefits and money I have gained from the pink phones project I use for my child, she says. I buy books and pens for her, and I used the money to buy clothes for her as well. I also save money for her to pursue a higher education in the future'Photograph: Simon Rawles       Chum Kor, far left, says: 'The text message I receive is really important because it helps me decide which crop to plant at the appropriate time, and it helps me to increase productivity.

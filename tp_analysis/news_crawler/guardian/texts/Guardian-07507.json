    "text": "The easternmost atoll in the Pacific Ocean, Clipperton Island is all that remains visible of an extinct volcano that rises above sea level by up to 100ft. Its mere 3.5square miles of land area, made up of coral rock and sand, is of less interest than its 7.3miles of shoreline and coral reef. To say Clipperton is isolated is an understatement. The nearest land is the Revillagigedo Islands, about 620miles north. Clipperton&apos;s marine habitats have several endemic species, including coral, molluscs and fish. To the slowly growing inventory of the tropical island&apos;s fauna we may now add sponges. A recent study led by Dr Rob van Soest of the Naturalis Biodiversity Centre in the Netherlands reviewed all the currently available material. Only three expeditions to Clipperton, in 1938, 1994 and 2005, are known to have returned with sponges, retrieving about 190 specimens, among which were represented 20 species. Of these, nine were entirely new to science. I am focusing on just one named by van Soest and colleagues, Callyspongia roosevelti. Although not photogenic, it has remarkable things to tell us. It encrusts dead corals in shallow waters to a depth of about 72ft and is a filter feeder like other sponges, circulating water that is taken in through pores, or ostia, passed through its central spongocoel, and then expelled through openings called oscula. Sponge shapes are supported by an internal skeletal structure comprised of organic filaments and spike-like structures known as spicules. These may be made of the protein material called spongin  which is very flexible, accounting for the springy nature of bath sponges  or calcareous or siliceous and hardened. Spicules are so variable in size and shape that they have proved invaluable in both the identification of species and studies of their evolutionary relationships. Some are simple cylinders with blunt or pointed ends, while others are more complex, with three or four axes. C roosevelti has glass-like, siliceous spicules. The geometric shapes formed by masses of spicules in an intricate network add structural integrity to the sponge body and can be quite beautiful when examined microscopically. I found the patronym of the species curious, not immediately detecting any connection to US president Franklin D Roosevelt, until I read that he had been instrumental in making the 1938 expedition possible. It was during that trip that specimens of C roosevelti were first collected.",

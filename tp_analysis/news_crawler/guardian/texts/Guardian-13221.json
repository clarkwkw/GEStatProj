    "text": "Nintendo has announced that it will be launching its scaled-down Wii Mini console in the UK on 22 March. It&apos;s effectively the classic Wii, slightly reduced in size and coloured black with a red band. No price has been confirmed as yet, but when the product was launched in Canada last November, it retailed at $99. A price point of between 70-80 is expected. To cut down on costs, the Wii&apos;s internet capacity has been removed, but the console does come with a shiny red Wii Remote Plus and a red Nunchuk controller. Nintendo has also added a selection of four new titles to its budget Nintendo Selects range of games: Mario Party 8, Wii Sports Resort, Mario Power Tennis and Super Paper Mario. Despite it&apos;s rather striking looks and low price, the Wii Mini received a mixed response from critics when initially announced, with Eurogamer providing a particularly damning review . Nevertheless, Nintendo is no doubt hopeful it can capture a whole new demographic of ultra-casual family gamers who have so far resisted the charms of the 100m-selling machine.",

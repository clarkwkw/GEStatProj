    "text": "The &quot;next steps&quot; document on special needs education, following the Queen&apos;s speech, drives a coach and horses through the aspiration to inclusion (Special needs kids deserve better than a rush to reform, 21 May). Parents havethe right to choose a mainstream school unless it is &quot;unsuitable to the child&apos;s ability or SEN&quot;  that is, they have a right just until some school or local authority tells them they don&apos;t. The right to mainstream is also said notto apply where it would be &quot;incompatible&quot; with the education of the other children. The survival of this nasty and discriminatory proviso utterly contradicts the document&apos;s new and welcome aim  mentioned 71 times in as many pages  of tackling the dismal record on employment as disabled children grow up. Children who are &quot;incompatible&quot; with their peers will become adults who are &quot;incompatible&quot; with employment of any kind. The government also finds itself contravening article 24 of the new United Nations charter on the rights of disabled persons.Richard Rieser and Chris GoodeyLondon",

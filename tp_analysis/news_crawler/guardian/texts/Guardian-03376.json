    "text": "Many of your pupils will have heard of Kony 2012, and may be among the 90 million viewers of the YouTube video posted by the US charity Invisible Children calling for the arrest of the Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony after it went viral on Facebook. The idea behind the social media campaign is to make Joseph Kony &quot;famous&quot; so he can be captured and tried for crimes against humanity. Last Friday, the campaign took to the streets as thousands of people joined in with the Cover the Night protest and plastered cities with posters calling on governments to get together to arrest the leader of the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army. The issues are complex, and the campaign has been criticised for oversimplifying the story  particularly by Ugandans, who point out that Kony and the LRA no longer operate there. The Guardian Teacher Network has resources to help pupils explore and expand on the issues involved, beyond just watching the film. ActionAid has put together a powerful set of resources that dig deep into the issues. Debating Kony 2012 is a lesson plan that will help to structure an informed debate about the Invisible Children &quot;Kony 2012&quot; video and campaign  and ultimately help children to decide their own involvement. The lesson plan includes three activity sheets to prompt close questioning and to facilitate a fruitful debate. ActionAid&apos;s Uganda after Kony PowerpPoint investigates the impact of decades of violent conflict on people&apos;s lives in Giriki, eastern Uganda. The resource of images and detailed notes takes us through the background of the conflict in Uganda, including the arrival and then departure of Kony and the LRA. The PowerPoint is designed to be used with Uganda after Kony lesson ideas and activity sheets, with the ultimate aim of helping students to understand more about the experience of living through conflict and to find out more about ActionAid&apos;s work in Uganda. What about Kony 2012? is a research activity by Cafod that will help pupils to understand the wider issues of the campaign. The resource includes useful notes, weblinks and worksheets. Students can also find out about communities affected by the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army in Cafod&apos;s What&apos;s the story resource, where they can read the story of Odokh, a former child soldier of the LRA. Also, they can take action through Cafod&apos;s online campaign Pass it on. War Child has a useful backgrounder on the LRA, including a response to the Kony 2012 campaign from a programme support officer in Uganda. The schools programme officer has also shared the Prezi presentation she has created to explain the issues to schools. Comic Relief&apos;s assemblies and accompanying films for primary  and secondary help pupils to understand the challenges faced by children living in post-conflict Uganda. To gain more understanding of the real experiences of a child soldier, see Amnesty International&apos;s resource on the powerful story of Ishmael Beah, who was just 13 years old when he became a child solider in Sierra Leone and has since written a book about his experiences. It is also well worth watching the follow-up film, Kony 2012 Part II Beyond Famous, which was put up by Invisible Children on 5 April and goes some way to address the oversimplification of the first film.

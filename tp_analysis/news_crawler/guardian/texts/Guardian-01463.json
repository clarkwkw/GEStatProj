Rolled tongues of wild garlicleaves poked stiffly. The ground dry with a strange violet-grey dustinessand a freeze thickened in the mud. The weather forecast was full of predictions for conflict between warm Atlantic air clashing against cold Russianair to bring snow and using the same angst-ridden tones that newsreaders speak of politics and economics in. This ill-humoured petulance pushes us further from our experience of weather. Out of a puddle-grey sky, the wind bringing the first hint of snow was chill and sweeping in all directions. In the woods, a fall of invisible, hail-like ice crackled like static through bare branches. In the open, the wind roared darkly through pines, soughed in the ash and hissed around limes and oaks. The small birds  blue tits and great tits squeaking in the treetops and wrens plumped up like bobbles  scarpered into the undergrowth. A ratty-winged buzzard trying to get back to safe shelter was intercepted by a raven in a brief ritual skirmish. A gang of jackdaws flung themselves from a lone tree into the wind and back. Out on the Edge, between the woodsand the fields, the wind ice cameneedling, stinging any exposed skin. It took a couple of hours before this turned to snow but it was only a loose swirl of 10p-piece-sized flakes andit softened into white quiet. Thefollowing morning the text of another world was written on the snow:tridentmarks of pheasant, doubleslots of fallow deer, dabs of rabbit. The slush trickled into drains taking the journal of that night with it. Yellow wallflowers began to recover.",

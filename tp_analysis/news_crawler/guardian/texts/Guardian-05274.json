    "text": "On the show this week Alok Jha is up against former mental athlete Joshua Foer. They&apos;re discussing his book Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything, his chronicle of a year in which he attempted to report on, and compete in, the USA Memory Championship. We had the honour of a visit from Marc Abrahams, co-founder of science humour magazine The Annals of Improbable Research and the man behind the Ig Nobel prizes. Marc discusses the hugely popular prizes and his tour of the UK. Don&apos;t forget that Science Weekly will be recording a live show as part of a series of curated events at the Royal Institution. The show will include science demos, great guest interviews and hopefully some intentional humour, so if you&apos;re going to be in London on 28 March get your free ticket now from the Royal Institution website.

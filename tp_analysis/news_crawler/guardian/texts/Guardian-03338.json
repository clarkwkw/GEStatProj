    "text": "In education and other areas, we have an extensive culture of performance indicators or &apos;league tables&apos;. By ranking schools, universities, hospitals and police forces they encourage the public to put pressure on those deemed to be &apos;underperforming&apos;. League tables have all the appearance of being useful and are often promoted as part of open government and freedom of information. A new report written by Beth Foley and me, commissioned by the British Academy, explores these issues in depth. It looks principally at the areas of education and policing and aims to provide the basis for a more informed debate. Tables look useful because they seem to help with &apos;public accountability&apos;, especially in identifying public bodies (such as universities) that may be poorly performing . They also expand the basis on which potential users such as students can choose  a point that has become linked with advocacy of competition between organisations. Government, the media and lobby groups love them. League tables for schools and hospitals became popular under the Major and then the Blair and Brown governments along with top down performance targets, such as hospital waiting times. Shame at coming low down in the pecking order is seen as a way of giving administrators an incentive to &apos;pull their socks up&apos;. But something suitable for Premiership football is not necessarily fit for judging complicated organisations such as schools or universities. What if the threat of pillorying an institution has side effects that damage rather than enhance their performance? Vice chancellors and managers may get fixated on improving their league table position rather than improving the quality of education. They may engage in &apos;gaming&apos; to improve their position, and this has been very evident within the school system in England and elsewhere and can have the effect, for example, of truncating choice or even excluding low achievers from certain programmes. Leagues are made up from numbers, derived from indicators of performance, such as exam performance or student ratings. But what is numerically measurable can divert attention from other, equally worthwhile, objectives and for higher education especially a major problem is that it has proved impossible to reach a universally accepted definition of what constitutes &apos;academic quality&apos;. Thus, for example, simple, unadjusted, measures of performance, may be potentially damaging to the reputation of those institutions which offer courses to more diverse students and those from poorer backgrounds. League tables can be faulty. Any given number from an organisation needs to be set in a context. School exam results can only be compared once we have looked at the children and young people the school admits. Similarly degree results or dropout rates need to be set within the context of admissions and retention policies and to pay attention to the characteristics of the students recruited, including their backgrounds and prior achievements. But even more caution is needed where numbers are small or samples biased. An example in the UK is the Student Satisfaction Survey that collects and publishes final year student ratings of their courses, where response rates are often low and samples small. Statisticians must sometimes just say no - the data behind the league table is just too imprecise, the uncertainty too large and the potential for bias too great. League tables should have large health warnings plastered all over them. Publishing league tables can be harmful, if not published with caveats and qualifications, although those will often get ignored. That is not to say that ranking organisations or public bodies should not happen but in contexts where the data can be treated with appropriate caution and care, and where those producing them are perceived to be acting in the best interests of the system. An interesting example is the Centre for Higher Education in Germany. Indicators are disaggregated, care taken not to emphasise small differences and confidence intervals are supplied. A particular issue for international rankings of universities is that these invite comparisons between university systems across countries such as the UK and the USA. Yet without careful adjustment for factors such as the size of the different systems, wealth and student backgrounds, such analyses have little meaning. There has been surprisingly little research on this and more attention would be welcome. Finally, serious consideration should be given to using league tables principally as &apos;screening&apos; devices, which are not published or made available beyond those institutions directly involved, but used within the context of an inspectoral system which encourages intelligent dialogue. There are good precedents for this, especially in the area of schooling and policing, and it would mean that institutions and policymakers can make improvements using as much information as possible, but without the perverse incentives arising from full public exposure.

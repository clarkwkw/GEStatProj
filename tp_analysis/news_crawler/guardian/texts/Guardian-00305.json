    "text": "Nobody announces anything on a Sunday afternoon. Nobody except Rockstar, of course.  The publisher behind the multimillion selling Grand Theft Auto series put out one tweet on the afternoon of 16 October  a refreshed version of its own logo, on a red background. That was it. So far the message has been retweeted 110,000 times.  This is not how the games industry tends to hype its forthcoming announcements. Big companies pump millions of dollars into events like E3 or Gamescom to ensure a huge audience for their meticulously designed teaser trailers. They set up hashtags, get prominent YouTubers onboard, roll out pan-global campaigns from 24-hour command centres, then obsess over every column inch of coverage. Rockstar changed its logo colour.     pic.twitter.com/BklXMlZ0UQ&mdash; Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) October 16, 2016    Whats this all about? Well, its about Red Dead Redemption.  The publishers 2010 western epic was a massive critical and commercial hit, bringing the open-world dynamic of GTA to the American frontier of 1911. With a wizened, Eastwood-esque hero in the shape of John Marston, a bloody revenge narrative and an elegiac tone, the game presented a vision of the wild west every bit as compelling, brutish and beautiful as anything from Leone or Peckinpah. Now it appears, a new title is coming. But no one is quite sure what. A following tweet, posted 24 hours later, showed seven figures silhouetted against a huge orange sun  seemingly referencing The Magnificent Seven; a timely decision considering the recent movie remake.     pic.twitter.com/iuwxwyL2cX&mdash; Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) October 17, 2016    Its totally unclear whether we should expect a HD remake of the original game (and/or its forbearer, Red Dead Revolver), a sequel or a prequel. Most fans are expecting the latter option, an earlier tale from the adventures of Marsten. Many have also seen a leaked map of the game, purporting to be the setting for the prequel  an area of land just to the east of Red Dead Redemptions territory. But none of this has been confirmed. Because Rockstar doesnt do confirmations.  It doesnt need to. Within an hour of the first tweet, there was already news coverage of the logo alteration on every major gaming and tech site on the web, and with the second message, it has turned into a rolling story. A trailer is expected to follow, perhaps sometime this week, with a launch possible in October. Rockstar will reveal more when the company is good and ready. Its a fascinating story in this era of corporate messaging desperation; when the prevailing wisdom is, hit every platform hard. Rockstar doesnt attend big industry events like E3, Gamescom, Pax or EGX, and it doesnt align its announcements with the usual beats of the industry year. For Grand Theft Auto V, a tweet with just #GTAV arrived on 25 October, 2011, followed by a trailer a week later. That game went on to sell over 65m copies. Red Dead is smaller fry with sales of around 15m, but its been so long since we heard anything from Rockstar, the company could probably have announced a follow-up to its under-appreciated 2006 release Table Tennis and it would have created a storm. As it is Red Dead is seen by some as Rockstars true masterpiece, a less corrosive, less bombastic proposition than GTA, suffused in the mythology and slower pace of the western. Everyone was expecting some kind of follow-up this year, but the publisher has left it late to say anything  and really it still hasnt said anything. It must have known, however, the massive interest its two tweets would make, surely ruling out a mere HD update. Even Rockstar couldnt get away with that.  The arch manipulator of video game fandom knows what it is doing. The slowest of slow burn releases. Let the forums and social media do the heavy lifting. If the game is as clever as its understated announcement it will surely live up to the anti-hype.",

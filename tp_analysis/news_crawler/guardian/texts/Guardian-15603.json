    "text": "     After 17 years beneath the ground, billions of cicadas are beginning to emerge along the US east coast.  The inch-long insects have spent their adolescence feasting on nutrients from tree roots. When the ground temperature reaches a steady 64F the cicadas burrow to the surface, shed their exoskeletons, and fly about, making a lot of noise in a bid to attract a mate. After several weeks of frantic relations the females lay eggs. A couple of months later, tiny new cicadas hatch, fall to the ground, tunnel to a tree root, and the whole process begins again. Earlier this month I went to New Jersey to document cicada nymphs (the name for a cicada yet to shed its exoskeleton) emerging. On Wednesday the internet was abuzz with reports of real fully grown cicadas, with wings and everything, making a nuisance of themselves on New York&apos;s Staten Island.  Armed with a video camera and no zoological training whatsoever, I went to investigate.",

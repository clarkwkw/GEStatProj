    "text": "   Silvia Peres Gomes, Rio+20 Photograph: Guardian    Sustainable development is a highly contested notion and one that has taken many forms: economic, political and social. Mozambique has come out of a long civil war and emerged as one of the booming African economies in the past 20 years, through undergoing structural reforms, stabilising macroeconomic environment thus attracting major foreign direct investment. It has had an average GDP/P growth rate of over 6%, irrespective of the global economic downturns since 2008. On the other hand this growth has not resulted in poverty reduction or job creation as expected. Therefore, one can suggest that development within Mozambique has only been economically focused. In other words, economic development without socio-political consciousness is problematic. Sustainable development should also be in the application of infrastructure, education and healthcare in order to have a population capable of maintaining themselves &quot;sustainably&quot;, bearing in mind that Mozambique has a huge problem when it comes to feminisation of poverty. A lot still needs to be done to combat this issue, and it will take many years to overcome it. My message to Rio+20 would be to help Mozambique achieve this balance by creating awareness of the gap we have in Mozambique for &quot;sustainable development&quot; within all facets of society. Will Rio+20 make a difference in my life? That isn&apos;t an easy question to answer. I hope that it will.",

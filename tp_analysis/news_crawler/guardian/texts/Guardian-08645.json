Kester Ratcliffe, Bristol  You don&apos;t say what course you are studying, but it doesn&apos;t sound as if it&apos;s vocational. So the only straight answer is: &quot;No, your degree won&apos;t ensure you have a decent career&quot;, as there are no longer any guarantees in the job market. What your degree does get you is the possibility of a better job, as many employers don&apos;t even bother to look at the CVs of candidates who haven&apos;t been to university. How easy will it be for me to change my course if it doesn&apos;t meet expectations?  Michael Higgs  If you want to change course, it&apos;s better to do so sooner rather than later: miss too much of your new subject and you will be asked to start again the following year  which has cost implications. Also remember that popular courses tend to be fully subscribed. Ifyou can find a place, an admissions tutor will want you to explain why you&apos;re not going to bail out of this course like you did the first one. So you&apos;re going to have to sell yourself hard. How do I challenge being harshlymarked?  Junior Kusi, Guildford If you believe that a lecturer has marked you unfairly, the first thing you should do is ask him/her to explain why. Transparency is the new norm and many academics live in terror either of being sued by students or hounded by their department for punitive marking that reduces the number of firsts and 2:1s awarded. If you are still not satisfied, go to the head of department and ask to have your work remarked. Why are science degrees seen as being harder/worth more than arts degrees?  Sarah Head, Nottingham I&apos;ve no idea! I guess it&apos;s because so many students found science impenetrable at school and have come to think of anyone who understands it as a genius. All of which almost certainly suits those scientists for whom quantum physics is a doddle. What you will find is that science courses tend to have a fuller timetable, so if your version of a hard course is one where you&apos;re expected to be at a desk by 9am then science won&apos;t be for you. But just because your arts degree isn&apos;t so structured with contact time, it doesn&apos;t mean you aren&apos;t supposed to be working.     Guardian students sign up banner  ",

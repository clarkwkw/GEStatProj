    "text": "What youll learnWhether you dream of becoming a coach to the Team GB elite, or want to help get more local people involved in sport, these degrees could help you achieve your goal. Sports science degrees are aimed at people who want to take a behind-the-scenes look at sport, exercise and health, coaching, management, and how the body works. While it could put a more personal spin on your studies, you dont need to be good at sport to take a sports science degree. Because of the range of courses that come under the sports science banner, a degree can lead to a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts qualification. Courses can cover anything from exercise physiology to the relationship between sport and the media. By the end of your course, you will have developed an understanding of human responses to sport and exercise. You should know how performance can be enhanced, monitored and analysed, and about the multiple health benefits of physical activity. You will also know the impact prolonged sporting activity and exercise can have on the body - for example, how muscles repair themselves after an athlete runs a marathon or a footballer plays a 90-minute game at altitude on a hot day. You will be able to understand coaching processes and what influences them, and the management and delivery of sports. You will also understand why sport is such an important feature of our society, and will learn about the challenges of teaching sport and physical education in a range of settings.   interactive   How youll learnThe ratio of theory and practice will depend on the course you choose to study, so look closely at the degree title. Sports technology, exercise physiology and sports psychology courses will have a heavy science emphasis. Those that mention management, sports development or coaching in their titles will have a more vocational leaning. All courses will, however, have a science bit - expect to study biomechanics, physiology and psychology, at least. Coaching degrees, for example, could explore the physiological impact and psychology of training. Some courses will involve professional placements, which will put flesh on the bones and provide you with valuable practical experience. What are the entry requirements?Many courses will expect you to have either biology, chemistry, maths or physics at A-level (or equivalent). A physical education or psychology A-level could also help your application.   interactive   What job you could getYou will be qualified for a career in sports coaching, management and administration - perhaps working as a fitness instructor, personal trainer or leisure centre manager. An increasing number of graduates are being recruited to provide sport science support for professional athletes, are employed by national governing bodies for sport, or are working in the ever-expanding commercial leisure sector, in particular within marketing and the promotion of sports goods and events. There is, of course, the option of further study and research. Or you could use your skills to teach sports in schools.",

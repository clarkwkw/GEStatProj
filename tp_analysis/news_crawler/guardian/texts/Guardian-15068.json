    "text": "This week Camila Ruz meets Dr Helena Cronin, co-director of the Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science at the London School of Economics, to discuss &quot;sexuality after genetics&quot;  the topic of a debate she will participate in as part of this year&apos;s How The Lights Get In Festival in Hay-On-Wye.  Why are males and females so different? Why would one identical twin be gay while the other is straight? Dr Cronin, who specialises in the genetics of gender and sexuality, also explains why she thinks there are &quot;more Nobels and more dumbbells&quot; among men than among women (it has little to do with our early environment, she says). Could eating creepy-crawlies save the planet? Camila interviews one of the participants of the Wellcome Trust&apos;s &quot;Who&apos;s The Pest?&quot; season, Prof Marcel Dicke, a leading entomologist and connoisseur of insect protein.  We also take a look at some of last week&apos;s big science news stories with two of the fabulous science-comedy trio Festival of the Spoken Nerd: Helen Arney and Steve Mould.  They join Camila to discuss the debate over the &quot;aquatic ape&quot; theory of human evolution, EU pesticide bans and the battle to save the bee and the key to extending the lifespan of mice, and possibly humans.

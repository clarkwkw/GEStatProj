    "text": "The paths in a Buxton garden are covered with small limestone chips. Little piles of from three to eight stones are frequently found by my correspondent on his lawn, some two inches or more from the path. He wonders what animal carries the stones from the path to the grass, and how they get them up the two-inch straight-cut rise at the edge of the turf. When he removes the stones carefully he sometimes finds a worm-hole beneath them, and I should suggest that the earthworms move the stones. Probably the chips fall into the superficial burrows when the worms are working beneath the path, and are then pushed forward and out at the other end of the burrow; these little piles would hardly be noticeable on the path itself, but they show when the output is on the lawn.",

    "text": "For me there is really only one way to play Fifa: as the manager of a League Two club such as Morecambe and with as much hope of making it to the Champions League as I have of being scouted for Barcelona while doing keep-ups in the garden with an old balloon. I can&apos;t play as Man City or Chelsea, or even Swansea or QPR. I need the full heroic narrative. I have to start in the fourth tier, working with players whom I can imagine still make a little extra cash doing roofing for their aunts in the off-season. This has been my routine since at least Fifa 10. I come into a club fighting relegation from the lowest league in the game and, little by little, investing in scouts here, hiring hoary old free agents there, I usher them back up the table and into the next league, and then the next. Until one day, against all odds, several life-weeks and many game-years later, Morecambe are sitting at the top of the Premier League on the final day of the season, preparing to take a shot at being crowned champions of Europe. At this moment in each of the past three years of my life, I have felt an odd mixture of intense pride and crushing regret, an emotional cocktail familiar to gamers everywhere. Luckily, as of Fifa 13, there will be a whole new chapter to the story: at around this moment, the FA will come knocking, asking: &quot;Would you like to manage the England football team as well?&quot; To which I, along with every other football gamer in the country, will answer: &quot;Duh.&quot; Regret will have to wait until after the World Cup. Of course, every new instalment of a sports franchise needs to offer something that previous versions haven&apos;t, and international management, while a welcome addition, is no great revolution. But what sets Fifa 13 apart is that the chance to manage England is just one short item on the very long list of new features worth getting excited about, both on and off the pitch. On it, perhaps the most noticeable is the new first-touch control system. One of the great flaws of past games was watching even the least gifted of players stop a curling crossfield pass at chest-height with a single poke of their boot and jog off with the ball glued to their feet. First-touch control abolishes sticky-boot syndrome. Unskilled players receiving powered passes at full sprint can expect to lose possession a lot. Meanwhile, those who keep control of the ball will find that they have a few more options than in the past: lateral dribbling allows the player to take the ball around defenders without losing sight of the goal, while the new close-control system makes it easier to nutmeg, shimmy and generally showboat your way past the opposing back four. If you prefer to carve them open with a killer pass, you&apos;ll find your team-mates now make more intelligent attacking runs, finding space more often, and much earlier. The player-impact engine  previously capable of some hilarious player pile-ups  has now got its act together. Its questionable physics looks sorted, and players can jostle for possession when chasing down a pass, giving your defence a more robust and combative feel. Free kicks, too, have had a healthy makeover, and two or three players can now square up behind the ball and make dummy runs, or lay it off for one another to shoot. If you&apos;re all about management, you&apos;ll find a host of improvements in career mode. Player swaps and cash-plus-player deals add new options to the transfer market, while other clubs no longer sell their best players, and decide who to buy and who to offload far more intelligently. In fact, just about every aspect of the game has got smarter: your own players make sensible requests for game time, showing an awareness of their status in the team, while commentators know much more about your side&apos;s position in the league, and read out the latest scores from games being played elsewhere. In short, Fifa 13 looks set to be the most complete and immersive footballing experience yet. It will also make it easier than ever to sign up with Shrewsbury and wake up six months later with a shelf of trophies and a social life in tatters. What&apos;s worrying is that this time you might have no regrets at all. Fifa 13 is on sale from 27 September.",

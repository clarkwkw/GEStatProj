    "text": "Batman is coming to Wii U. At Nintendo&apos;s E3 press event on Tuesday morning, Warner Bros announced a new version of Batman: Arkham City for the forthcoming console, sub-titled &apos;Armoured Edition&apos;.  Developed by the WB Studio in Montreal, the game contains all the content of the current Arkham City, including the DLC released on Xbox, PS3 and PC. However, it adds a new feature, Battle Armored Tech (B.A.T.), which allows players to build kinetic energy during combat, which can then be used to unleash savage attacks on enemies. It&apos;s not entirely clear how this energy is built, or whether it involves moving the pad itself, but more will become clear later in the event.  The GamePad screen also acts as a wrist-mounted Batcomputer throughout the game, allowing players to select items as well as scan the in-game environment by holding the pad up and physically moving it around  a neat use of the device&apos;s accelerometer technology. In the same way, players can steer a batarang while it&apos;s in mid-air, using the GamePad screen which provides a batarang-eye view of the flight. Players can also use the pad&apos;s screen to detonate explosives. You can see the trailer here:            Armoured Edition is scheduled for release this winter.",

    "text": "     Reading this on mobile? Click here to view Dishonored was one of the year&apos;s surprise hits: it was set in a steampunk parallel world, wasn&apos;t a sequel to anything, and steadfastly insisted you do a lot of your own thinking in its long, involved missions. So, not standard fare by any means. Rather than giving you more plot, Dunwall City Trials adds a set of one-off challenge levels, which range from a stealthy burglary job to straightforward combat with waves of enemies. The Bend Time Massacres are probably the standout, in which you must attempt to eliminate specific targets, or simply as many people as you can, from rooms full of baddies. There are low points too, but, at less than the price of a pint, its solid, thoughtful puzzles and unlockable expert levels offer an intense and interesting set of tasks  and more content is planned for 2013.",

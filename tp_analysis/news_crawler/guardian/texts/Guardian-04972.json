    "text": "Your article (Cruel Britannia, G2, 4 January) made horrific reading, exposing not only the unimaginable suffering of badgers illegally baited but also the extent of cruelty to many other species illegally pursued, tortured and killed by people using vicious dogs as status symbols. The article has inspired us to unite as representatives of the animal welfare community and as concerned, compassionate individuals to unanimously condemn this appalling criminality. We ask for increased vigilance from users of the countryside who may be in a position to catch these despicable criminals in action or as landowners to prevent their access. Cruelty to animals in this way is barbaric and the perpetrators must be brought to justice and feel the full force of the law. It is already evident that more and more people are prepared to show courage by reporting sightings of suspected wildlife crime, gathering evidence and helping to prosecute those involved. This inhumane and illegal activity must stop. The advice for anyone who suspects badger baiting or any crime against wildlife is taking place is as follows. Members of the public should always avoid putting themselves in danger. Where possible, details of location, vehicles involved (colour, make, registration number) should be obtained, plus descriptions of perpetrators and ideally, photographs. Then move quietly out of sight and earshot and ring 999 immediately to pass on the details; ask for immediate attendance by the police and obtain an incident number. We hope that many other organisations and caring individuals will unite with us in our campaign against cruelty in the countryside by emailing office@duckproductions.co.uk so that their signature can be added to future publicity.Dr Brian May Founder, Save Meand representatives of 14 member organisations of the Badger Protection League including: David Williams Chairman, Badger TrustVirginia McKenna Founder, Born Free FoundationWill Travers CEO, Born Free FoundationLorraine Platt Co-founder, Conservatives Against Fox HuntingJohn Rimmington Press officer, Hare Preservation TrustAnne Brummer Founder, Harper Asprey Wildlife RescueMark Jones Executive director, Humane Society International/UKDr Dan Lyons CEO, IASJ (animal protection thinktank)Robbie Marsland Director, International Fund for Animal WelfareJoe Duckworth CEO, League Against Cruel SportsAndrew Plumbly Executive director, Network for AnimalsLibby Anderson Acting chief executive, OneKindDavid Bowles Director of communications, RSPCAPauline Kidner Founder, Secret World Wildlife Rescue",

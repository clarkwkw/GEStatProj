    "text": "The US Federal Trade Commission has hired a prominent trial lawyer and former federal prosecutor to oversee its broad investigation into Google&apos;s business practices, signalling the agency is troubled by what it has discovered in a year. Former justice department prosecutor Beth Wilkinson  who has won 40 cases and lost none in which she has litigated  will take the reins as the FTC digs deeper into allegations Google abused its dominance of internet search to stifle competition and drive up online advertising prices. The FTC announced the move on Thursday. Meanwhile the European commission has given no indication of whether it will take a similar move against Google, as a result of its investigations into similar antitrust claims against the search giant, which has a larger share of the market in Europe than in the US  at more than 90% compared with about 70%. But its antitrust team led by Joaqun Almunia has been deliberating for months, raising expectations it will either initiate an investigation or possibly work with the FTC on a settlement. Wilkinson is best known for helping to convict Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in 1997. Now a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison in Washington DC, Wilkinson also has experience in antitrust law and white-collar criminal cases. The FTC stressed that Wilkinson&apos;s hiring should not be interpreted as a sign it definitely intends to sue Google. &quot;We are delighted to have someone of her calibre helping us on such an important matter,&quot; said Richard Feinstein, director of the FTC&apos;s Bureau of Competition. Wilkinson&apos;s involvement in the case is, however, a clear sign the FTC&apos;s staff has uncovered problems that may require taking Google to court to resolve, said Dave Wales, who preceded Feinstein as the FTC&apos;s director of competition. &quot;This may not be a declaration of all-out war, but it&apos;s like things have been ratcheted up to Defcon 4,&quot; said Wales, now a partner at the law firm of Jones Day. &quot;You don&apos;t do something like this unless you think there is a good chance there will be litigation.&quot; Wilkinson&apos;s involvement in the investigation also may give FTC more leverage to negotiate a settlement, Wales said. He predicted it could be a year or more before there&apos;s a settlement or lawsuit. Google declined to comment on the appointment of Wilkinson. The company, based in Mountain View, California, has consistently denied any wrongdoing. The FTC&apos;s investigation was triggered by complaints Google has been highlighting its peripheral services in its influential search results and relegating offerings from its rivals to the back pages. The agency also has been examining whether Google has rigged its results in a way that has impelled websites to pay more to promote their services through Google&apos;s advertising network.",

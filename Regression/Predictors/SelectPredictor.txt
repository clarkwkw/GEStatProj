Process of selecting predictors

1. cGPA
  significant but not enough info (adj R^2 = 0.2677)
  
2. cGPA + G1 to G5 learning outcome
  only cGPA and G1 significant, but adj R^2 (0.2723) not increase much 
  test the model for prediction using 1617T1 data
  Root mean square = 0.4523309
  
  when using test data to construct the same model,
  only cGPA is significant

  => G1 to G5 have low explaining power
